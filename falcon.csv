She had come to America at 19, enrolled into a well-respected college and majored in accountancy, with a minor in Law. All paid for by her best friend in England.

Soon after ending her education, she had seen a chance in starting at the finance department at Stark Industries, and which just graduated youngster wouldn't jump on that chance; not only did it pay well, SI was known for their excellent Personnel policy: dental and hospital insurance for one.

Now 5 years after accepting her job in SI, and 3 years after becoming Tone Stark Personal assistant, she felt confident in being both the billionaire's employee but also his friend.
She knew from experience just how difficult it can be to live with such fame, her best friend had the same problem, and she had seen what it did to him, at times.

Said best friend was also the reason she was on her way to speak to Tony, she's made sure his and her schedule were clear for the next week, with only a charity gala to attend at the end of said week. She'd deliberately made it so, for her best friend was coming to stay in America too.

Giving in het access code to Tony's workshop, the first thing she noticed was the loud AC/DC music playing, with a smile she nodded to where she knew one of Jarvis' cameras were and the AI cut the music.

""J, what gives?""

Pepper smiled and made her way to where the voice came from; ""Tony, I would like to go over something with you.""

She found the genius underneath one of his vintage cars, most likely repairing it, again, only to take it for a spin and crash it again.

""Pepper, I was sure my schedule was clear for today, and most of the week even. Did you threaten the board members again?""

Pepper smiled, ""no I didn't, and your schedule is clear, I need to speak to you about something personal.""

Tony rolled out from under the car he was fixing and sat up, looking at her; ""you're not quitting, are you? Because I am not sure I can function without you anymore.""

Pepper shook her head with a smile; ""no, of course not.""

This made her companion sigh in relief.

""I just wanted to let you know I'll be taking some holiday days for this week. I will still be at the charity gala on Friday evening. But my best friend is coming over early next morning and I would like to spend some time with him. It's the last thing I owe him seeing as he paid for my schooling here in the USA.""

Tony looked at her and she could just see his brain whirling at 100 miles a minute. Most likely remembering that she was British born, even if she had done her best to get rid of the accent.

""Anything you can tell me of this best friend?""

Pepper sighed, she should have expected this, better to get this over with and just tell him, because the man would find out anyway and who knew just how far he'd search after that.

""His name is Hadrian Black, you already did mention him once, he's the Brit who suddenly popped up to take over Marauder Inc. and started investing into small time cooperation.""

Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, running a hand into his hair after; only succeeding in smearing the grease that was already on there over the whole of his forehead.

""How did you get to know someone like him? I thought I was your first multi-billionaire?""

Pepper smiled, a sad look in her eyes; ""that's kind of a long story, but I am willing to share.""

Tony nodded and got up, sitting himself on the sofa he kept in his workshop, patting a space next to him as he took a drink DUM-E brought him, pulling a face after he tasted it.

Pepper took a seat and took a deep breath.

""I assume you heard of the bombing that took place in the UK some years before now. ""

Tony nodded.

""I, together with a lot of schoolmates were involved, most of the terrorists had the opinion that if you weren't likeminded, like them, you had to be exterminated. Most of my family and friends worked together in stopping them. In doing so I lost one of my older brothers, Percy and my boyfriend, Colin.""

Pepper swallowed, this still hurt to talk about, ""seeing as going to school wasn't that good of an idea at the time, I studied online and took my GCSE and A-levels with a small group at the department of education and passed them all with good grades. By now most of this terrorist cell had been caught and made to stand trial, but some still roamed free. This led to my parents keeping their kids extremely close, even though some of them were married already.

It made me so feel so suffocated that I sort of ran away, I did tell them I wanted to leave and study here in the USA and build up a new life. But they wouldn't let me, seeing as I was the only girl after 6 boys, one of whom never came home after a bombing, only my youngest elder brother and his wife understood, they didn't like it, but they understood. They helped me get to Hadrian's house and he helped me set up a new identity and paid for everything. My parents weren't that wealthy or had the connections he has.""

Pepper sighed, ""it has been 5 years and I haven't really talked to my family accept Ron and Hermione, the mentioned brother and his wife, seeing as they are all angry, I left. Hadrian finally handled everything he had to handle in England and now he's coming here, especially since Marauders Inc. HQ is in Los Angeles. He wanted to spend some vacation time before taking the reins full time.""

Tony looked at her; ""first question; what was your name before? And second question who has been leading Marauder Inc. in his stead then?""

""It used to be Ginevra Weasley, I had it changed to protect me after all the bombings and I was known in the terrorist circles, it was one of Hadrian's demands, not that I disagreed. Being Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts has been liberating to be honest.

As for your second question, Hadrian's only surviving uncle and the only surviving Marauder, they were a friend group with Hadrian's father, godfather and uncle, had a son when things were heating up in the UK, so he didn't think twice about getting them out of the country and setting them up in America, Remus and his wife Nymphadora are the ones currently running Marauder Inc. at least until Hadrian will be here and enjoyed a few relaxing days.""

She knew the moment she said names JARVIS would be looking them up, so she kept quit.

Suddenly Tony whistled; ""That is one best friend you have, Hadrian Black, formerly Harry Potter, has a bachelor's degree in business management and linguistics. Was employed with Britain's special forces and took missions with MI6. Owner of Marauders Inc. and co-owner in several small businesses who are all doing very well. He also has several charities: the Tom Riddle orphanage, formally Wool's orphanage; Snape's shelter for domestic abuse victims and the Lily foundation which covers scholarships for gifted children; although it says here they meant gifted in the broad sense of the word; they have some donations to mutant shelters and schools.""

Pepper smiled, tears in her eyes; ""That is such a thing for him to do, I know why he named those charities the way he did, but it is not my story to tell.""

Tony nodded, a glint in his eye making her suspect he'd do just that at the first presented opportunity. It might not be that bad an idea to introduce her boss-best friend to her regular-best friend, they might just get along.

They ended the conversation with Pepper promising to bring Hadrian with her on Friday and asking Tony if it was possible for Happy to drive her to the airport. Hadrian had a rental waiting at the airport, and she'd have him drop her off, but she needed to get there first.

Tony agreed, because for once he didn't need to be anywhere, no meetings, no evaluations for the departments, no interviews. For the next 5 days all he had to do was enjoy himself in his workshop and attend that one charity event at the end of the week. He could manage that. Maybe he should ask Pepper to take a few days off more regularly.

The next morning, Pepper was waiting on her front step for Happy, two thermoses full of coffee in her hands. She knew she asked the nice driver to bring her to the airport, but it was still 3 in the morning, so she had done the decent thing and brought coffee.

Seeing Happy pull up, she opened the passenger door to pass him his thermos and took a seat next to him. Tony always complained that Happy wouldn't let him sit in the front, which she explained was because 'he's your employee, Tony, he is paid to drive you around', while he never minded her taking a seat next to him.

Coffee in hand, they chatted mostly about Tony as he did have the strange habit of collecting his friends in weird places. Happy had been a former boxer who, after he didn't fight in the ring anymore, took a job as a bouncer in a nightclub.

He didn't like the job, but it gave an income. One night, a young Tony Stark had been visiting the club and had paid extra to have Happy by his side all night. The other employees at the club were star stuck by the young heir, but Happy just treated him like any other costumer.

At the end of the evening, he'd been given the nickname Happy because of his serious face. He also left a business card with the message that if Happy ever wanted another job to give the mentioned number a call.
After sleeping on it for the next days, Happy had called the number and was answered by JARVIS, who had been notified and told him to be at Stark Industries the next morning at 8 AM.
Tony had greeted him with a smirk as soon as he saw him standing there, pushed some papers from HR in his hands and welcomed him on the team as his bodyguard/driver.

Both Pepper and Happy smiled with mirth in their eyes, they had both been very lucky to have met the force of nature that was Anthony Stark, thinking fondly of how much better their lives had become after meeting the genius.

While reminiscing, the ride to the airport seemed even shorter, so when Happy pulled into the drop off lane, Pepper was shocked to see they had arrived.

""Thank you for driving me, Happy!""

Happy gave a small smile, ""no problem, Pepper, have fun catching up with your friend. We'll be seeing you Friday?""

Pepper nodded, giving a wave, and entering the airport terminal.

A couple of people were looking at her, as she was standing in the greeting area, probably wondering if Tony Stark would come out one of those doors. She sighed, Tony was very recognised, not that this was a bad thing, but seeing as everyone knew she was his PA, they assumed that he'd be there if they saw her.

Luckily, no one tried to approach her, but she did see some people either texting or calling people, so she had to be prepared for some press to be present at the exit.

She frowned, this was not how she had wanted to spend her week, especially with Harry finally coming to America. She knew how much the man hated the press; he'd dealt with enough shit back in the UK from all those vultures.

Biting her lip, she checked her watch again, it was just after 4 AM, meaning Harry should have landed by now and would come her way any minute.

For those of you who followed before 2020, make sure to go check out the first chapter too.I rewrote it and plan on updating once a week now (I know it took a LONG time).

Hope everyone is staying safe!

Harry was looking forward to his trip to America, well not really trip, he'd go and live there too.

He had, had it with the English Magical community, especially after everything had been handled, Voldemort had been defeated- even if he felt for Tom Riddle and what the boy had been through, the Death Eaters were caught and put on trial - it had been revealed that more than a fair share of those with families had been blackmailed in supporting the Dark Lord or they would lose their family.

After he had testified on the behalf of the Malfoy family, both on the parts of Draco and Narcissa and their help in making sure he survived long enough for Voldemort to cast the Killing Curse once more and killed by the backlash. More law wizards had approached him, telling him stories similar to the Malfoys.

After losing so many people already, he didn't see any harm in going and listening to those people, who in fear of their family; their children and spouses, had followed a mad man, hoping that Harry would indeed stop him.

A lot of Light families hadn't been happy with that, they had seen all the Death Eaters as the perfect people to put the blame on, ship them all to Azkaban and be done with it.

The fact was, he couldn't stand that hypocrisy nor that discriminating view most of the Wizarding world had, it was either black or white, or Light and Dark in their case, and nothing in between. As a young man fitting in both Gryffindor and Slytherin, this had been something Harry didn't understand.

He spoke out for that, pushed the public in demanding fair trials for everyone, to make sure they didn't put away any innocent men, like they had done to his godfather.

In the end he had succeeded, with the help of Hermione, to make sure every Death Eater got a fair trial, and was judged based on their testimony, under the influence of veritaserum, instead of the nature of their own magic.

This all, however, made him fall out with the Weasley Parents. When Percy was killed in the last battle, Molly had freaked and locked their children, even Bill and a pregnant Fleur, in the burrow.

They had been all miserable, but none more so then Ginny, she had lost Colin the fight, but hadn't been able to say goodbye as her Mother had locked them all up, or as much as one could be locked up in their own house.

Ron and Hermione had contacted Harry soon after, telling him of how Ginny was depressed and didn't do anything at all. That she missed Colin and their Mother had taken away her chance to say goodbye at the funeral.

She needed out, and fast at that.

What not a lot of people know however, was that even on the run, and in Ginny's case during the war, they studied for their GSCE and A-levels, hoping to escape the Wizarding World, at least for a little while.

Harry helped get Ginny to America, giving her a portkey that would bring her to Remus and Nymphadora, where she could stay and take lessons at a college of her choosing, away from the UK. He even made sure she had another identity and give her permission to use his money to get on her feet.

This, which Molly saw as kidnapping, even is Ginny was an adult by Wizarding standards, and him helping the people she saw as inherited evil, made him an unwelcome guest in their home , those few times he did visit.

She was the only one though, but as matriarch, her words were law, or so it had been for now.

Not long after Ginny left, Ron and Hermione stormed off, coming to live with him in Grimauld Place, until they both had a job and could afford their own place.

Bill and Fleur also departed to their cottage at the seaside, telling Molly in no uncertain terms that she wasn't welcome right now, that all of her children were grown-ups, and she couldn't just lock them all up.

Charlie disappeared back to Romania, tending to his one and only love, dragons.

The twins, Fred and George, also went back to their joke shop, rebuilding the store and their apartment above, again with some help from Harry.

Molly saw Harry as the reason her children were like this and left her. She also saw him as the reason as to why her whole world was changing. Suddenly people were listening to him, instead of just printing lies about him, as they had also seen why he was doing this.

Why he was fighting for people who had been on the other side, but who had done so with a reason all of them could understand.

Together with Ron, Kinglsey and surprisingly Draco, they had systematically gone through everything from the ministry to saint Mungo's. Pointing out where there had been corruption the past and how easy it was to uphold that corruption if things stayed the way they were tight now.

For Saint Mungo's, they went looking for Muggleborns or Squibs, who had a medical degree in the muggle world, to use those practices in the Magical community as well. They even called out to their allies like France and Russia, to compare what they were doing was along the lines of what those countries did.

It had gotten some attention in the international press, to have the Boy-Who-Lived starting a revolution, to bring the British Magical Community into the present in both medicine, law, and politics.

Most had been happy to help, especially those of minority groups; like Muggleborns, werewolves, vampires, and squibs. As well as those Harry had helped during and after the war, giving him a majority, against people like Molly Weasley.

After a battle, if one could call it that, where they made changes and implemented a new way of working and thinking, Hermione was chosen as the new Minister, the first ever Muggleborn. At her side, Draco Malfoy, Luna Lovegood and Justin Finch-Fletchley - giving the new Ministry a head office consisting of 2 Muggleborns and 2 purebloods, as well as a representative of all four Hogwarts Houses.

After keeping busy with that the last five years, as well as getting everything in order to take over the company his father and Sirius had build up, Marauder's inc., he needed to get away from the UK.

He'd had it with reporters everywhere, the questions just kept coming both from the reporters, as well as from the general public, and the nay-sayers who believed he was Dark and wanted to give the reign of the Wizarding World to the Dark aligned.

Remus was seeing over MI right now, sending though updates and questions when the werewolf didn't know what to do.

Harry so far had taken over several small corporations, giving them the boost they needed to keep running, especially when a lot of those were headed by Muggleborns who had went back into the Muggle World after their schooling, or by squibs, who had been abandoned by their families.

He'd also taken the money he'd gotten from people who died in the war and used it to provide relief for the orphans, by converting the former's Wool Orphanage into Tom Riddle's Orphanage, specifically for Magic children.

Further he'd started the Snape Shelter for domestic abuse victims; more often then not either children who was magic, but who were born in a religious family (for the Muggleborns) or one parent and their children when their spouse was abusive to them or the children, no matter if they were magical or not.

The Lily foundation, was something he had put up for those who didn't have the funds to provide an education for their children, be it magical, mutant, or just regular. In their search for magical inclined muggle doctors, they had found one in Ireland who used her magic on her patients, but who had explained it away with saying she was a mutant - giving all of them a look into the world outside of theirs.

Full of other enhanced people, who didn't hide and lived among the civilians.

It had opened up a whole lot of possibilities and job opportunities. So, Harry made sure to jump on that, both with MI and the small businesses he owned. After all, if he could set an example to hire both magical beings and enhanced people, what is to say other corporations won't follow his lead.

So far, since he implemented that rule, Stark Industries, Pim Tech and Rand enterprises had followed his example.

 

Boarding the plane, however, had felt like such a relief. He'd made sure to go and say goodbye to everyone and make sure they could reach him should they feel the need to do so. Especially Ron, Hermione and Draco had been sad to see him go but understood just what kind of pressure had been on his shoulders the last 5 years, it was time they took that over.

There had been plans made to visit for the holiday season however, and to of course keep in contact with each other.

On the plane itself, after checking in his luggage, was an adventure. He'd never flown in a plane before, only on a broom, so he was very exciting for that to happen.

He took a seat in the business class, because of the space he would have at his seat and the inclusive meals and drinks. Also, to make sure he actually could get some sleep on the 11 hour flight, which would arrive in Los Angeles at 3:55 AM.

He was really looking forward to seeing Ginny, or was it Virginia, or Pepper, again after all this time. They had kept in contact of course, but not seeing someone for 5 years was quite a while, especially when he'd helped her get out of the UK and start a live in the USA.

He had to smile, thinking about that, Gin hadn't been idle, she went to Harvard to get a degree in accountancy, with a minor degree in law. Had taken an opportunity, when it presented itself, and did a job interview at Stark Industries, where she'd been hired as a junior accountant.

After 2 years on the job, she'd been promoted to business accountant and been told to handle all the incoming and outgoing spending, only to discover an abnormality, which she took to her boss - Tony Stark, prompting the man to hire her as his Personal Assistant.

The rest is, as they say, history, even if she technically is employed with a competing business. Not that he blamed her, besides MI, which had been idle until 5 years ago when Remus moved to America, SI was one the giants in the industry, known to be converted by Tony Stark from a weapon making company on a national scale, to a technologic empire on the international market.

MI was more focussed on medical advancements, helping small business owners to set up their project and have the backing of a company which could catch them in it failed. Beyond that they were primarily busy with converting muggle things into magical ones - for example laptops or smartphones.

They had succeeded with that in televisions and radios, but were seeing to expand, especially with the technologic advancements now in play, and the fact that a lot of people carried a smart phone now a days. If they wanted to keep advancing, as a Magical community, they needed to follow that path too.

More importantly, for him at least, were changes to something like phones for enhanced who had extra strength and had to buy a new phone every time they crushed theirs. Or for were wolves, an extra firm one that could survive the transformation and subsequent running around, without breaking or getting lost.

He took out his own phone, a prototype, to check his messages. Smiling at seeing what his friends had send him, from general updates, to Hermione's picture of Rose and Hugo, and Gin's confirmation she'd be waiting for him to step foot on American soil.

Laying his seat, a bit flatter, he enjoyed those thoughts as he closed his eyes to take a nap.

As he fell asleep, Harry groaned as he woke up inside his mindscape. Sitting up, but deliberately not turning to the entity standing behind him.

""What is it you wanted, Death?""

The entity behind him, approached, putting a hand on his shoulder, making Harry turn around and look at the woman behind him, her black hair framing her face under the hood of her cloak, dark blue eyes looking at him with a gaze older than the universe.

""You will be meeting my Merchant soon, my Master.""

Harry pursed his lips, hating the title he now carried, he didn't perceive himself to be anyone's master, least of all Death's. But he did look forward to meeting this Merchant, back in the UK, after the final battle, Death had appeared to him, explaining that he had 'mastered' all the Hallows, even if he didn't carry them on his person.

She explained that over the course of her existence, she had found people or beings, or whatever you wanted to call them, that had proven something to her.

Her Merchant, she had said, had died multiple times, but every time that happened it hadn't been his time yet. The man had approached death each and every time, with a smile on his face - seemingly missing the people he left behind, yet not minding being away from them either. He was a strong soul, she had told him, full of wonder, incredibly smart and according to her sister Faith, would change the world as it was known.

Her Champion, was a mercenary, so he regularly gave her the souls of people that were past their time and needed to be collected, but seeing as a reaper couldn't just tear a soul out of a living person, she send her Champion to do it. He also learned that the man, couldn't die and hated to never be able to get close to death again - not in a way friends would normally do, for she described him as her friend too, next to him being her Champion.

Death had chuckled and told him that he and Her Merchant were like that too, out of her grasp until they asked her to reap them, which would take a very long time.

Harry sighed, but smiled at Death.

""Ah, I do look forward to meeting him. Does he know of his title yet?""

Death made a so-so motion with her hand, ""kind of, I did tell him when he 'died' the last time, but as he wakes up, he doesn't remember it. I do plan on telling him soon when he is alive instead of dead.""

Harry nodded, intrigued by this man, even though he hadn't met him yet.

""Is that the reason you wanted to come to America, because I told you of my Merchant and my Champion being here?""

Harry hummed, ""just a bit, I also wanted to go to America because that's were Gin is at the moment. And because I was sick and tired of the UK. It also helps that Mutants, enhanced and superheroes are more of a norm there then they are in the UK, meaning I can use my gifts without having to be careful who sees.""

Death nodded, ""there are indeed a large number of enhanced beings in America, more so then in other countries. I think it has something to do with it being the land of the free.""

Harry looked at her, before giving a smile, ""so no, I did not want to go to America just because of the Merchant, but it is a bonus that I'll meet him soon.""

Death returned the smile and pressed a kiss to his brow, ""enjoy, My Master, and we will meet again soon.""

Harry opened his eyes to look at the flight attendant who had shaken him awake.

""Sorry to disturb you, Mister Black, but we will be landing in about 2 hours. Furthermore, would you like your meal now?""

Looking at his watch, he saw that it would be 9 AM in the morning in the UK, so he nodded, he hadn't eaten before leaving to the airport, so he was famished.

As the flight attendant brough him his food, and asked what he'd like to drink with it, he enjoyed the meal provided, he'd have a rather long day ahead of him, even if this was to be his holiday.

He'd meet with Gin, Pepper, at the airport, get a coffee with her at a local coffee shop to catch up somewhat, get his rental car from the agency and drive it to the house he'd live in, the same one Dora, Remus and Teddy lived in too. He was still not certain if he'd move out, he had missed them all, so some time with that part of his family wouldn't hurt.

After that he would take Gin, Pepper, sightseeing, so she could show him all the special places LA had to offer, maybe shop for some new clothes too.

Drive to MI HQ and go over some paperwork with Remus, meet with his board members and management staff. Look up some small businesses he owned in the city or mail them for an appointment if they were located in other states.

 

As he arrived at LAX, Harry couldn't help but look around in awe, he was used to lot of things, but this was impressive all in its own way.

Walking along, following the signs to the waiting area, he had to smile as he saw Gin, Pepper, standing there, waiting for him. He knew he was smiling, as het whole face lit up at seeing him. Putting down his carry-on case (which had everything he needed shrunken down in it) he opened his arms for the hug she gave him.

A soft kiss was pressed to his cheek, as she released him to link their arms, after he took a hold of his luggage again.

Pepper sighed, ""I missed you.""

A softer smile appeared on his face, ""I missed you too, even if you went and got a job at the competition.""

Pepper gave a fake gasp, ""well, I never...""

They started laughing at that, falling back into their relationship of brother and sister, now that they were together again. At one point in their younger years, people had assumed that'd end up together and marry with a whole flock of kids. But Harry had confided in her that he was gay, just before the war broke out in its fullest.

But seeing as she hadn't seen him like boyfriend-material for some time, she didn't have a problem with it, and felt honoured he told her first, before Ron and Hermione.

As they walked through the halls of the airport, people with their phones out where staring at them, some of them talking into the phones.

Pepper groaned, ""I forgot about the reporters.""

Harry looked up, a startled look on his face, ""Already?""

Pepper shook her head, ""none from the WW, most are from gossip magazines here in Cali. For some reason people think Tony, my boss, and I are an item. So, they assumed I was here waiting for him to come off a plane. Which is ridiculous seeing as the man has 2 private jets.""

She sighed, ""they'll be making a whole spectacle out of this, especially after seeing me with another man.""

Harry grinned, ""seriously, that's how they do things here in the USA? Should I expect Prophet BS or is it something else?""

Pepper shook her head, ""it's something else, with all the celebs living here and the known party scene in the city, at least a couple get busted every day for doing something like a DUI, cheating on their partner or getting into a fight.

Beyond that, those vultures also go looking for things that aren't there, like a chance meeting that looks like more, or a celeb without his or her partner... and the speculations that follow it.""

Harry scoffed, ""don't they have anything better to do?""

Pepper shakes her head, ""it sells, so they don't see a reason to stop doing it.""

Shrugging his shoulders, Harry leads them towards the rental agency, taking care not to give too much notice to the people not so subtly following them.

He entered the office, ringing the bell on the front desk, and waited for an employee to arrive. Which took quite a while.

A bored looking teen finally came and sat down.

""How can I help you?""

Harry lifted an eyebrow, ""is this how you great all your customers? All disinterest and making people wait.""

The teen shrugged her shoulders, ""some old rich dude brought up the rental agency, so my boss took a long holiday to Hawaii, I'm just a student, and I don't know how to run this place. How can I help you?""

Harry sighed, ""you can get me your boss on the phone right now.""

The teen looked at him like he'd grown a second head, ""I can't do that, he yelled at me last week for disrupting his holiday. If I call him again, he'll fire me, and I really need this job for college.""

Harry frowned, before turning to Pepper, making the teen stare wide eyed at the woman she knew was Tony Stark's assistant.

""Can I borrow your phone? Mine doesn't have an American number yet.""

Pepper nodded and give a sleek white STARK phone to her best friend, who after asking for the number of the owner of the rental agency, dialled and waited for it to be picked up.

""What"", was the first thing he heard as someone picked up on the other side.

Harry's eyes climbed higher on his forehead.

""Mister Forks, can you please tell me why, when I came to pick up my car, you weren't here at this moment?""

A grumble sounded from the other side, ""What's it to you, you Brit, do you tell me you disrupted my holiday for this, after some old man brought my company, I am rich and can do as I please!""

Harry's eyebrows disappeared in his hair, this was the soft spoken gentleman he had talked to some months earlier, who wanted to be sure he could provide for his people and his family. He closed his eyes for a second, before opening them, ""then you can consider this your resignation phone call, be sure to have all your assets collected before tomorrow or it will be given to the next manager I hire. Good day.""

Without waiting for an answer, he hung up the phone and gave it back to Pepper. The girl at the desk looking at him fearfully and with a little awe.

""You, miss, there should be keys here on name of Harry Black, could you get those?""

The girl nodded and went to look for the keys, coming back with them and handing them over.

Harry smiled, ""can you close up for today, seeing as you said yourself you don't know how to run this place. I plan on having a new manager hired as soon as I pass by my HQ. I'll have HR contact you when they plan on opening again, or if not, to see if we can't get you another job.""

The girls just nodded, turning around to go and get her stuff and lock the door to the office. She walked past them in a daze.

Pepper looked as she walked past, ""that poor girl, did you not know what an ass he was when you brought over him firm?""

Harry shook his head, ""he sounded very genuine and in trouble, not to mention his wife is a Muggleborn. They seemed like they could use some help.""

Pepper shook her head, ""it's sweet that you want to help, Harry, but not everyone is genuine on the phone. Lots of people pretend to be someone they are not, to get sympathy or help, without even feeling guilt about what they did.""

Harry shrugged his shoulders, ""it happened, I'll let HR know, when we stop by, that they need to look for a new manager. Other then that, this is something to learn from.""

Pepper looks at him funny, ""that's a very special mindset, you gave yourself.""

Harry grinned, ""I needed to, can't be feeling bad about every mistake I make or made, it happened, bummer, let's move on.""

Looking around he added, ""let's go find my car and look for a place that sells coffee.""

Pepper gasped, ""you drink coffee, as a Brit?""

Harry grinned, ""blame Draco for that, he has to have coffee every morning, it rubbed off on the rest of us.""

 

They found a cafe not that far from the airport that served a variety of coffees, much to the pleasure of both Pepper and Harry. Taking a seat at the window, just so they could people watch, they ordered a latte caramel for Pepper, and a cappuccino for Harry.

While waiting for their drinks to be made, and looking at the treats the cafe offered, they stayed silent, until the barista brought them their drinks and they ordered a fruit tart for Pepper and a piece of cheesecake for Harry.

As this was brought over and they enjoyed their drinks and treat, Pepper looked at Harry.

""So, that car rental place?""

Harry nodded, ""I didn't buy it that long ago, after Mrs. Forks called MI through a friend she had, telling us her husband was really struggling with everything and how she had heard what we did for those more misfortunes than others. Especially after she explained that her husband was the only one with an income. She had finished at Ilvermorny with quite high scores, but never got a degree counting in the muggle world as we did - so she was stuck at home, watching the kids.""

Pepper sighed, ""and you love a good sob story.""

Harry grinned, ""I've been told it's my people saving thing. Only now I actually help people without putting my own life in peril!""

Pepper sighed, again, a smile on her face despite the exasperation on it.

""You can say that again, it's a wonder none of us have grey hairs, or in Remus case, more grey hairs, than that. Because with everything you lived through...""

She didn't finish her sentence, smiling fondly at the man sitting in front of her, happy to see him again after 5 years of phone calls, facetime, and owling letters to and from.

""So, how is everyone back home?""

Harry grinned; ""Ron and Hermione welcomed their second child into the world not to long ago, Hugo. Rose is exited to be a big sister.

Bill and Fleur welcome baby number three, so that's Victoire, Dominique and Louis. Fleur did tell me that this will be enough, she likes children, but does not want to emulate your parents.

Charlie is still happy single and tending to his dragons.

Fred and George are still running their joke shop, and they do date, but nothing lasts for longer than a few months. Last I heard they had asked out Tracy Davis, but she said no.""

He took a deep breath and continued, ""I still haven't talked to your parents, seeing as your mother still thinks I am some reincarnated Dark Lord for fighting for fair trials for all involved in the war. Especially after Draco came on board 'Mione's cabinet as Minister. As far as I know none of your siblings stayed in contact with them either, your mother of course sees this as my fault, but it does seem to hurt your father a lot. Kinglsey told me last that Arthur came to him, because he was sick and tired of Molly bugging him about everything.""

Pepper sighed, but nodded, everyone knew just how her mother had seen her life, have her marry Harry, pop out babies and live happily ever after. Even if this was something neither of them wanted.

Harry grimaced, putting his hand on hers, in a show of support for her decision still.

""Draco finally proposed to Astoria; took his long enough too!

Neville and Luna are happy together, Neville as assistant professor Herbology and Luna writing her book together with Rolf Scamander, with some help of Newt.

I am just excited to be moving here, the UK was getting to much at times, especially with most of our friends busy with their own lives now that nothing is in peril, not that I blame them, but I needed some fresh air and the possibility to do whatever I want, whenever I want.""

Pepper nodded; she had felt the same way after the war. Especially with the way her mother kept her in the house and wouldn't let anyone leave. It was so confining and restricting that she started to resent her mother for it. To know that Molly didn't see the fault in her own actions but kept blaming Harry for them defined the notion that she was a control freak with unresolved issues she didn't want to look for.

After coming to America and enrolling into Harvard, she had been taken aside by one of the counsellors who kept seeing certain behaviours which most PTSD victims had. It had taken a while, but she had given the edited version to her, which in turn lead to an appointment with a squib psychologist to help her deal with the trauma, both during her schooling and just after it with the war, and the loss of both Colin and Percy.

Harry had helped her find the psychologist and had admitted to seeing the same one over video call while he lived in the UK, he was planning on seeing her in person soon, for some of the same issues.

Together with Hermione, they had integrated mental health care into the Wizarding World as well, seeing as something like that wasn't just fixed with a potion or a spell. It had really taken, especially with those of their generation and the one behind them - with the help from either squibs and Muggleborns or half-bloods who had gotten a degree to work as therapists or psychologists. Or recently, also by people just in the known, either because of a family member or by marriage.

Harry was looking at her, a soft smile on his face, probably knowing what she was thinking.

""It's helping, Gin, Pepper, this will take some getting used to. Anyway, it is helping, I have multiple people a day writing to me how happy they are that we now offer mental health care, when before you were send to a mind healer, and in the worst case scenario, were tucked away in the Janus Thickey ward.""

Pepper nodded, she had heard the stories of people they now knew had depression or some other more common mental illness, but because no spell or potion healed them they were tucked away in the Janus ward, stapled as irreparable spell damage and left forgotten.

It had hurt her, and others so much to hear this. Especially when the healers and medi-witches had protested to treatment from 'muggle doctors' on those poor souls, not wanted to admit that they had been wrong in just 'forgetting' about them.

When one of the first ones made it out of St Mungo's with prescription pills and a recuring appointment, but feeling so much better, lots of people had been astonished to see such a thing was possible.

Shaking her head, Pepper looked at Harry and smiled, ""I am so happy we made that difference. That you kept pushing and pulling for everything and made it all happen. Even if you chose to come to America now.""

Harry wrinkled his nose, ""I'm just sick and tired of the masses in the UK, everyone wants a piece of me, either to thank me or to hate me. No one just wants to be around me, except our friends, for the sake of being around me. Not to forget that dating is impossible, I tried a few times, but it was always in the newspaper the day after and I didn't dare do so with a random enhanced...""

Pepper nodded, with Harry's status as Master of Death, which they had all kept a secret, no one knew how others would react, especially enhanced people, seeing as there was little known about them and their DNA.

Pepper just smiled, ""I am really glad you're here though; it hasn't been the same without you, or anyone here. Remus, Dora and little Teddy are amazing, but it's not the same, especially now that I have my own apartment.""

Harry nodded, ""I can understand that we all missed you too.""

They stayed quiet for a moment after, enjoying their coffee and treat, and basking in the presence of their best friend.

An impish smile appeared on Harry face's, ""how is your love life going?""

Pepper went red, ""it goes, I went on a couple of dates with someone else from SI, we see each other a lot in day to day work, but he's very sweet and I really like him.""

Harry nodded, ""that's important, but I am happy that you let yourself love again, after Colin.""

Pepper nodded, ""it took a while, and some therapy, but Hilda let me see that I have to move on, that Colin would have wanted me to move one.""

Harry nodded, ""death never waits, but that doesn't mean you just have to wait for Death.""

Pepper nodded, Harry because of his connection to Death, and his regular talks with the deity, had the ability to talk to people already crossed over too. He started saying that sentence to everyone who was or is grieving, to let them know it is okay to move on.

It had helped a lot of people, especially after the way, with so many young people losing their lives. A lot of them had been married or in a relationship, and their partner often didn't know what to do with their life now that they were alone.

In the plan they had made around mental health, support groups had been founded for people wanting to talk to a like minded individual, to help each other. One of the first to be founded, had been one at Hogwarts, to support those students who had lost a class- or dormmate, to help them cope.

Pepper shook her head, ""enough about this topic, as much as I want to hear all about the changes in England, I would like some lighter topics too.""

Harry nodded, agreeing with her.

""So, what do you want to do, this week?""

""Well, I was hoping to go to the headquarters and make sure everything is in order for my official start next week.

After that I was hoping to just explore the city with you, buy some stuff, spoil you some - seeing as its been so long since we went shopping.

Spend at least one day just at home, maybe cooking or baking, I don't think Dora will mind. And getting to know Teddy all over again, I don't think he remembers me.""

At this, he pulled an exaggerated sad face, making Pepper laugh.

""On Friday I have my grand entrance into the American business world, with the gala at the Children's hospital.""

Pepper beamed, ""the one down in San Francisco?""

Harry nodded, ""you were invited too?""

Pepper shrugged, ""Tony was, and I always go as his plus one, to avoid some gold digger hanging onto him all night.""

Harry hummed, ""so he's also...?""

Pepper shook her head, ""gods no, I love him like a brother, but Tony and I would never work out. He keeps his mask on too firmly in public for us to work out. No, I am dating his bodyguard/driver Harold Hogan, he goes by Happy as a nickname.""

""So, you'll introduce me to them then?""

Pepper nodded, ""sure, I know Tony already did a background check when I mentioned I would be taking the week off.""

Harry hummed again, he was expecting that, from what Pepper had been telling him of her boss, the man liked to know who he surrounded himself with, to make sure he wasn't taken by surprise later. He didn't mind, he had after all done his own background checks, every time Ginny, Pepper mentioned someone new in her life.

Pepper hummed, ""so down to HQ we go?""

Harry shook his head, ""got to put away my luggage first, and I want to see Remus, Dora and Teddy at home instead of at the office after missing them for so long.""

Pepper nodded, she could understand that, sending Remus, Dora, and Teddy out of the country had been one of the first things Harry had done when they found out Dora was pregnant. Stating that he didn't want Teddy to grow up like him, without parents and wondering just who they were and how they looked like. He deserved better than that.

It had been a fight between Remus and Harry to get the werewolf to agree, but he had in the end, to assure he would be there for his son, and godson, when both of them would need him.

Paying their bill, Pepper and Harry left the little cafe, even if the waitress was starstruck at having recognized Pepper and googling Harry. They giggled about it after they left, looking forward to this, new life in Harry's case, and life with her best friend back in it, for Pepper.

Getting into the car, Harry and Pepper were still laughing about the waitress at the coffee place, and the starstruck look in her eyes at recognizing Pepper, which let to Pepper telling Harry in detail just how she came to be where she was, business wise.

""So, you just pepper sprayed his bodyguard, now you boyfriend, because he wouldn't let you in when you found a giant error in the accounting files?""

Pepper nodded, ""Happy has since forgiven me for that, especially when Tony was happy I found it, he had deliberately put in the files, to see if anyone would come and talk to him about it. To find out it was the intern that came forward. Well, let's just say the manager from the finance department still glares at me whenever he sees me.""

Harry gasped, ""he was allowed to stay on?""

Pepper nodded, ""it was more a test on the efficiency of the department, and not a real transaction that took place. He was talked to; shown his error and I know from others that the department is running smoother than it has in years.""

Harry whistled, impressed, ""and this was what, within your first year of working there?""

Pepper nodded, ""Tony asked me to become his personal assistant soon after, and except the better pay, I really love doing it. For all that he is a great boss, he's still an engineer at heart, so he gets lost in inventing a lot, I am there to pull him out of his binges and make sure he attends a meeting or event when he forgets. Or on the rare occasion, attend for him, when he doesn't or can't stop his inventing binge.""

Harry hummed, liking what he heard so far, after all he loved making sure his company made innovations to help the more enhanced people of society, especially now that they were becoming more the norm.

Before they'd gotten onto the freeway, to get to the Black mansion just outside LA, someone called Harry's phone.

With a raised eyebrow, he picked up, curious as to who would already be calling him.

""Hadrian Black, speaking.""

A timid woman's voice sounded on the other side, ""Mr. Black, this is Mrs. Forks, well former Mrs. Forks, I'll be Ms. Abernaty when the divorce is settled.""

Harry hummed, ""I assume this is because of the phone call I made with your soon-to-be ex-husband?""

""Yes, sir.""

Harry hummed again, ""I don't like to be cheated on, Ms. Abernaty, but I have a feeling you were as well.""

At this, both he and Pepper heard her sniffling on the other end.

""You know what, come by MI this afternoon and ask after me, so we can clear this out, seeing as things have obviously happened since we last talked. Is this a possibility for you?""

Ms. Abernaty stuttered, ""yes, I mean, that should work, I can make 1 PM, if possible, sir, so I can get my kids from school at 3.""

Looking at Pepper, who shrugged her shoulders in agreement, Harry responded, ""One is fine, Ms. Abernaty, I'll be seeing you soon.""

After a goodbye he ended the call, groaning, while Pepper smiled.

""Ah, the Potter people saving thing is called in action again.""

Harry blew a raspberry at the woman next to him, smiling after, she was right though, but he had a good feeling about the coming talk.

""Well, slight change of plans, we go home, put away my things, shower, say hello to Dora, Teddy and Remus - seeing as it's about 5 AM now, so they, at least Remus should be getting up now, go into the city around 8 when everything opens to go shopping for a bit, drive to MI to take care of some things I need to get in order so I can start next week and get HR and security posted on that meeting with Ms. Abernaty.""

Turning to Pepper, he asked, ""you really don't mind do you, I mean, this was supposed to be a holiday.""

Pepper shrugged, ""and I know you, as well as myself, we'll both be working in between holiday stuff, neither of us were good at taking down time, so I don't mind.""

Harry smiled, taking the exit that would take him to the Black home.

Arriving at the driveway, he put his car in the underground garage, smiling at the Honda Civic, which by the taupe colour belonged to Remus and the bright blue Toyota highlander belonging to Dora. Looking at his own car, the dark green grand Cherokee Jeep didn't stand out that much.

Taking out his luggage, he took the stairs to the kitchen, hoping they didn't make too much noise entering.

Remus was already standing in the kitchen, a mug of coffee in hand as he checked his phone for any messages, most likely from him.

Hearing someone enter the kitchen, he looked up, beaming when he saw just who had walked in.

""Harry, Pepper, I thought for sure you'd text me when you arrived!""

Harry grinned sheepishly, before telling Remus what had happened at the rental agency, making the older man frown.

""I think it's a good thing Ms. Abernaty will be coming to HQ, Harry, seeing as this story doesn't add up. We'll be hearing about it this afternoon.

Enough work for now, you were going to take a holiday this week, which I know won't actually happen, but still. How was your flight?""

Harry grinned, ""great, loved it. Well, I love flying on a broom even better, but I do like this too, wouldn't mind taking the airplane more often.""

Remus sighed, ""great, because I hate flying, so you can do all the outstate visits from now on.""

Pepper laughed, remembering the first time Remus had to fly to meet with some business owners on the east coast, he's come back all haggard and swearing he'd never fly again. Werewolf senses were not made to be coped up in a plane for hours on end.

Harry grinned, ""sure, I am planning on taking over everything as CEO as soon as next Monday, Moony, have you given it any thought at to what function you'd want?""

Nodding, Remus explained, ""I'll be your CFO, which I already was when Sirius and James ran the place, most of the top tier functions have been filled, especially now with Dora taking up HR, now that Teddy goes to school.""

Harry grinned, ""so all the family under one roof, both at home and in the business.""

Remus nodded, giving a sly look at Pepper, ""except Pepper here, she ran over to the competition, not willing to wait for MI to get back on its feet after everything that happened.""

Pepper huffed, ""I like where I am now, thank you.""

All three of them laughed at that, Remus coming over to them and giving both a hug, Harry's lasting significantly longer than Pepper's.

""I did miss you, cub.""

Harry smiled, ""I missed you too, I am so happy to be here!""

Remus nodded, a smile still on his face; ""so what's the plan for today?""

""Shower, get changed, hug Teddy, hug Dora, go shopping with Pepper, eat something in the city and go to HQ in the afternoon.""

Remus nodded, ""swing by my office first thing, I have your new phone and American number ready. I'll introduce you to everyone after your talk with Ms. Abernaty.""

Harry nodded, leaving Remus and Pepper in the kitchen while he went and found his room, not that it was hard. Even if Remus was older, he insisted Harry get the master bedroom, with bathroom attached. Opening the door, he was met with a green room with a dark brown wooden floor and ceiling, the large windows open to allow fresh air to come inside.

Smiling, he went and unpacked, unshrinking as he pulled his belongings out of the trolley he took as carry on luggage. Waving them towards the place they should go, clothes to the dresser, books to the closet by the window, hair, and body products to the bathroom and so on.

As he put the trolley in his closet, he picked out some semi casual clothes consisting of a green dress shirt, black jeans, a darker green blazer, and black leather shoes.

Jumping into the shower, he was glad to be able to wash that plane feel off, for all that he loved being on the plane, it was still a rather small space filled with a lot of people. Standing under the spray, he could only smile as he thought about what his life in America would entail and how different it would be from his life in England.

Getting out, he dressed in the clothes he was prepared and brushed his hair after drying them with a spell.

As he opened his door, he was almost knocked over by a small form hugging his knees.

""Harry, you're here! You're really here, daddy and momma and Aunt Pep said you would be, but I had to be sure and daddy said he heard the shower stop so I came to look, and now you're here and I missed you!""

Smiling softly Harry looked at the tawny brown haired, grey eyed little boy that had to be Teddy, putting his hands underneath the boy's arms, he hefted him up and on his hips.

""Hello to you too, Teddy, I missed you too, se much in fact that I'll be living here for now, as well as work together with your daddy and momma.""

Teddy's eyes started to shine, ""really, really really!?""

Harry nodded, ""yep, I'm here for a good while, so you won't have to miss me anymore.""

Carrying a cheering 5-yearl-old, Harry went back to the kitchen, where pressed a kiss to Dora's cheek as he passed her, a smile on both their faces.

""Harry, finally, we're so happy to have you here with us!""

""Glad to be here, Dora, I take it Teddy needs to eat before he goes to school?""

Dora and Remus nodded, prompting Harry to put Teddy on a chair so he could eat the cereal set out for him.

Pouting a bit, Teddy refused to eat, probably wanting to spend as much time as possible with Harry now that the man was close by again.

Harry chuckled, ""eat you breakfast, Teddy, I'll still be here after you come home from school. In fact, your Aunt Pep and I will be eating here this evening and we can talk all the way to your bedtime, alright.""

Reluctantly, the youngest member of the family started eating, giving everyone a kiss before Dora took his hand to get him into the car and to school.

As his wife and son left, Remus pressed a kiss to both Harry's and Pepper's cheek, ""see you in the afternoon!""

Both nodding with a smile, they too left the house and entered the car again, making their way to the city for some more catching up and shopping.

 

At 12:20 Harry entered the HQ of MI and couldn't help but look around in awe, the entrance alone was very welcoming, with soft creme coloured tiles and a warm brown on the walls. Plants were put by the walls and close to the waiting areas. The front desk was in the middle of the hall, behind it a huge staircase was seen, leading towards what Harry guessed the offices. Behind the staircase was a long hallway, probably to the meeting spaces, and further, as well as underground, the labs and testing facilities.

Approaching the front desk, Pepper by his side, he saw more than one person not knowing what to say at seeing Pepper Potts standing there.

Clearing his throat, he smiled as the woman manning the front desk look up, a smile on her face.

""Welcome to Marauder Inc., how can I help you?""

Exchanging an amused look with Pepper, he told the woman, ""I have an appointment with Mr. Lupin, could you let him know I'm here.""

The woman, obviously stunned that he was there to talk to her boss, made a call and told him to wait just a second, as Mr. Lupin was coming to collect him.

Remus came down the stairs, a grin on his face as he took in Harry and Pepper standing there.

He shook his head, ""Really, Harry?""

Harry shrugged, smiling at the woman behind the desk, ""you obviously didn't tell anyone who I was seeing as I haven't been recognised yet. I can't just walk though when they don't know me, now can I, Remus.""

Remus grumbled, and looked around, seeing that more than one person had stopped what they were doing to stare at the young man talking to their boss like that. Sighing, he took a hold of the front desk phone and put in a code that let him speak over the speakers.

""Gooday everyone, I would like to point out the black haired young man standing in front of me, is in fact Hadrian Black, my godson and CEO of Marauder Inc., Thank you!""

The woman at the front desk seemed shocked at who he was, but he waved it way, smiling at her.

""No harm done"", looking at her nametag, ""Katie, you couldn't have known.""

With that Katie smiled slightly, still overwhelmed, ""Of course, sir.""

Harry shook his head, ""Harry is fine, I don't want to run a posh business.""

Katie gave a small smile.

""Ah also, a Ms. Abernaty will be coming here in about half an hour, could you let me know when she's here?""

Katie smiled, before looking at Remus, ""I take it that's the 007 line then?""

Remus nodded, when he first started, he took the 008 line, instead of the 007 line into the CEO's office, now everyone knew why.

""Thanks Katie!""

With that they all walked up the stairs to Remus' office.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Smiling as they went up the stairs, Remus went first, leading them towards an office just before the end of the hall.

Entering it, it was very obviously Remus', from the brown tones on the walls, to the books on the shelfs, some of them were those Remus had written as a Master in Defence Against the Dark Arts. But the one thing that gave it away the most, was the picture frame hanging on the wall next to the desk.

It was one of those frames comprised from several smaller frames, showing pictures of the Marauders in their teens, one of James and Lily's wedding, some of Harry, Remus and Sirius and most recently of Dora, Teddy and Remus.

Smiling softly Harry looked at Remus, while the older man was looking at him, a soft look on his face. Opening his desk, Remus took out a small box, opening it, it showed a green smartphone.

""I take it MI succeeded in magic proofing smart phones then?""

Remus nodded, ""mine and yours are one of the first. It functions just like a regular muggle one, with internet connection and Wi-Fi, as well as apps to be downloaded in an app store.

We're still in the process of filling our app store though, seeing as we are a newcomer on the tech market, and we need to make some name first. Some companies, who have someone in the known, are easier, but not everything is in order yet.""

Harry shrugged, ""I guessed as much, we'll get there eventually.""

Remus grinned and nodded, ""your SIM card is already in it, you just need to start it up and put in your email and contacts and what not.""

Harry nodded, doing just that, as they made their way towards the office at the end of the hallway. The silver nametag on the door telling them this was Harry's office.

Opening the door, Harry was greeted by a green office, and dark brown furniture, no pictures were put on yet, but there was a phone on his desk, the sticker on the lower corner naming it as phone 007, so that's what Katie meant.

Harry grinned as he looked around, already planning on buying some picture frames to hang up, as well as which pictures to put in them. He also planned to take his laptop with him the next time he came by, to install that already and make sure his IT department knew what he needed to get installed on it before Monday.

""This all looks perfect, Remus, and thank you for holding the fort all these years.""

Remus nodded, a soft smile on his face, ""I don't mind, but I am not CEO material, Harry, please never ask this of mee again. I am more than happy with being CFO.""

Harry nodded, he didn't think he'd ever have to instal Remus as CEO again, even if he had to go out of state, or even out of the country, he could keep doing his duties while away. Even if Remus had done a splendid job, he wasn't him, and he had a lot of ideas to implement into the company as well as ideas for products they could produce, especially now that phones were able to get adapted to work around magic.

Standing around the desk, Remus disappeared to his office, before returning with a couple of sheets of paper.

""Here is the phoning list, from every internal line, it gets easier to call people when you have a list, especially the first few days and weeks, I know I kept it close to me as a lifeline the first year.""

Harry nodded, taking the list and going over it.

000 for example was for the front desk phone, 001 and 002 were the janitors, 003 was the main testing facility, with 004 the main production lines, 005 and 006 were in meeting room 5 and 6 (the largest ones they had), 007 was himself and 008 was Remus.

Starting 009 were personal lines, for everyone from a team leader to the finance department.

As he went over the phone list, his own phone started ringing.

Startled, Harry hurried around his desk, picking up and hearing Katie on the other side, telling him Ms. Abernaty was waiting for him at the reception. Checking his watch, he found it was 12:50, meaning Ms. Abernaty was punctual.

He nodded to Remus, and left Pepper in the older man's office, while he went and got Ms. Abernaty, for a talk.

Following the hallway towards the staircase, Harry descended, seeing more than one person looking at him and nod. It seemed Remus memo over the phone had gotten to a lot of people.

Looking at Katie, he saw her pointing towards a slim, blond haired woman of around 30, sitting down in one of the waiting rooms.

He approached, ""Ms. Abernaty.""

She turned, a small smile coming to her face, ""Mr. Black.""

Harry nodded, shaking her hand, before mentioning her to follow him. He led her up to his office and offered her a seat.

""Would you like something to drink, Ms. Abernaty?""

The woman seemed to think about it before asking for some water.

With a smile, Harry pressed 999 on his phone, connecting him to house elves into the building's kitchens, asking for a water and some coffee to be brought to his office. As he put down the phone, a tray popped up on his desk, holding the requested items.

He had to smile, happy that he'd hired a group of 10 house elves who kept staff supplied with drinks throughout the day, as well as snacks, should they be requested. They also manned the company kitchen and restaurant, where anyone who worked at MI could get breakfast, lunch and supper.

Smiling at the woman in front of him, he started; ""Ms. Abernaty.""

""Please, sir, Carol, I'd like to be spoken to by my given name.""

""Carol then, could you tell me what happened between out first phone call and now?""

Carol nodded, ""when I called you, business for Fred were going really badly, or at least, that's how they seemed to look for me, every time I looked at bills and our bank account. We're low middleclass, but we do have 3 mouths to feed.""

She took a deep breath, ""when I called you, a friend of mine gave me your number and told me of your initiative especially for enhanced and magical people living in the muggle world. I never worked before, seeing as I didn't have my SATs, nor did I have a college degree. Fred always told me he didn't mind, that he would bring in the money so I could stay at home with the kids.

After I called you and you called him, offering to buy the business, I though all of our problems were solved. But weeks went by and not one dollar was put on our bank account. At first, I thought it was all a sham, and I am sorry for that, that we were set up and money wouldn't come.""

A tear ran over Carol's cheek, ""one night, after the kids went to bed, I wanted to spend some time with Fred, when I heard him on the phone, talking to someone named Kelsey, with whom he had an affair with, who he gave so much of our money seeing as she did have a job as a flight attendant, which is how they met.

He wanted to build up a life with her, and leave me, so he took the money you wired over to him, to book a flight to Hawaii with this Kelsey, telling me to be out of the house by the time he came back home, he left divorce papers behind.""

Carol was crying now, ""it's like he never cared about me, nor about our children. I have no idea where I should go with my children, nor do I know how I can provide for them.

He called me, furious, yesterday, yelling that I had ruined everything. The other woman had heard the conversation you had with him and left him just like that, because he wasn't rich anymore - talk about superficial.""

Taking the handkerchief Harry handed to her, Carol wiped away her tears.

""I wanted to make sure you knew this, Mr. Black, what really happened and when I did call it was for the best possible future for my family, I only after found out what a scumbag my ex-husband is.""

Harry nodded, a soft smile on his face, ""it would seem, Carol, that you have had quite the hectic live for the last few months.""

Carol just nodded.

""Tell me, do you know anything about your ex-husband's business?""

Carol nodded, ""I helped him do the finances, as I always loved arithmancy while in school and even though I don't have a muggle education, I still did the finances and loved to listen to Fred's stories about his work.""

Harry nodded, ""then would you be willing to take over the rental agency?""

Carom gaped at the man in front of her, not believing what it was she was hearing.

""Just like that?""

Harry shrugged, ""I already fired him and don't plan on hiring him back. With me taking over the company the coming week, we were going to look for a new manager anyway. But if I can already hire someone, who knows how it was run and would like to do it, I don't see why not.""

Carol gaped some more, ""I... I would love to, Mr. Black, but my children...""

Harry waved a hand, ""first of all, my employees call me Harry, I don't really do formal. And second, MI has an intern day-care for children of our employees. I know a lot of people that work for me are rather young and would like children, or have young children, that need care, even if they have to work.

To compensate I set, or had my godfather set up, a company wide day-care for children up to 12-years-old. We have people who go and collect children at the school they go to, or even at a nursery they stay during the day - so you can come and get them when you're done working.

Would this be agreeable for you?""

Carol nodded, ""Yes, Mr. Bl... Harry, thank you, I would love to. I love cars, especially after I married a nomaj who loved them and told them all about them when we were younger and still dating. I also know the girl, Charlotte, who works there.""

Looking at Harry, she added, ""he probably let the poor girl open it all alone, she's a great administrative worker, but that's about it. Can you, is it possible to keep her on.""

Harry smiled but nodded, ""I let her know we'd let her know when we had a new manager, or if we didn't find anyone else, some other job within MI for her.""

Carol nodded, ""she'd like that, she's a student at the UCLA, majoring in marketing, so some experience in sales is great on her resume. I, how are we doing this then?""

Harry smiled and called for Remus, knowing that the werewolf would hear him, and indeed, within a minute, the man was walking into the office, smiling at his godson, as well as Carol, he shook her hand.

""Carol here as accepted in taking over the rental agency from her soon-to-be ex-husband, could you help for a moment with the contract, as well as the paperwork for the inside day-care?""

Remus nodded, waling back to his office and coming back with a contract and the paperwork for the day-care, taking a seat next to Carol, he started to explain.

They decided on a 32 hour contract, for day hours, which meant they needed 2 more managers to man the early and the late shift, but that was a problem for later. After Carol signed, Remus went over the paperwork for the day-care, telling her which papers she needed to fill out, which things they had to know about the children, and which paper to file at their school, so their workers had permission to go and get the kids from school.

As they stood and shook Carol's hand, the woman thanked them again, thanking them for taking the time to listen to her and to even solve all her problems for her. She looked forward to starting work on Monday, Harry promised to let Charlotte know that the girl could start up then too and to drop by that week to see how everything went.

Guiding her back to the reception, Harry waved at her, waved at Katie, before going back upstairs to have Remus introduce him to everyone and show him just where everything was in MI.

Already updating, hope no one minds I do so earlier than normal.

My country is in partial lockdown, so my almost-3 yo was home this week, while my husband is working from home and has a broken toe, so a lot of the chores and toddler watching/keeping busy has been my job.So I am just really tired right now, won't be able to post later (as I normalle do after dinner).

Enjoy, and let me know what you think about it!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

After getting to meet all the managers and administrative staff in the building, Harry made a clip of himself - introducing himself as the new CEO, taking over from Remus. What his goals were for the company and what he wanted to accomplish for his workers.

He also asked them all to come to him if they had any questions or propositions, that he'd love to listen to all of them. He even mentioned that should they know someone who was looking for a job, to let them know and give any contact information they had on the person job hunting.

Before leaving MI with Pepper, he went by HR, to file the contract Carol had signed, as well as to ask Dora to call Charlotte and let her know she could start again next Monday, for at least 32 hours a week, until new managers were found. If she came by the coming week to sign her new contract as a working student.

After saying goodbye to Dora and Remus, waving at Katie and other people he had met during the day, Harry checked his watch to see it was only 4 PM in the afternoon, prompting him to go back into the city with Pepper to buy some picture frames for his office, as well as some plants to put there as well.

While he never liked gardening after growing up at the Dursleys, he did however like keeping plants and looking after them. Enjoying something grow and become stronger always reminded him of himself and gave him something to do on the quiet periods - like cutting away dead leaves and watering his plants.

Taking their time to wander the city after, they made their way back to the Black home just before dinner time.

As they walked in, Pepper was on her phone when she suddenly snorted, a laugh coming to her lips as she was glued to her screen.

As she looked up and saw the questionable glances of Remus and Harry, she handed over her phone to her best friend.


'Potts to leave Stark for mystery man'



'New love for Pepper Potts'



'Stark out, new man in'


It went in like that for a while, always accompanied by pictures of the both of them out and about. Having fun, as best friends do, especially best friends who hadn't seen each other face to face in 5 years.

Harry scoffed too, before handing the phone to Remus, Dora looking at it over her husband's shoulder.

Remus scoffed too, ""seems like the vultures already descended on you, Harry, this is still quite innocent, but let me know if they cross the line, I got a lot of feedback today that people were looking forward to working with and for you - so PR would love to start a law suit when they slander or use you to purposely give out bad information.""

Harry nodded, beaming at Remus when the man said his employees were looking forward to working for and with him.

Remus nodded, ""the story of what you did for Carol, as well as it being your idea to provide a company day-care, won you a lot of points, cub. You might be young, but you do think thus through and are more than open to innovation from your workers - that's a special case.""

Looking at Pepper, he added, ""I think SI is the only other company in the state to use such a tactic.""

Pepper nodded, ""Tony became the owner of SI, technically, at 16, when his parents died. He held off on actually being part of the company until he was 17 and had finished at MIT. He took over as head of R&D the moment he graduated and became CEO at 21.

Seeing as he was so young, he was mostly treated as someone who didn't know their stuff, which never made sense, seeing as he has 3 PHD's and a couple of Master diploma's in different fields. But anyway, seeing as he was not taken seriously until he started making real changes, he got the love from his employees for providing things like dental care, a hospital insurance and the possibility to let him know if something was bothering them or if they had an idea to add to the empire that was SI.""

She took her phone back and put it away, ""also, as someone who is at most time, doing 100 things at once, it helped to have people at hand who knew what he was doing, or who had suggested the idea of what he was doing and could give a helping hand.

Not to forget that we also have a very successful internship program, with a great medic and dental plan as well, and contrary to most internships, ours are paid.""

She had to laugh, as she looked up and saw Harry writing this down.

""Watch it, Potter, don't go stealing our ideas.""

Harry shook his head, a smile on his face, ""I wouldn't dare to do that to you, Pepper, but I have to agree that a paid internship would be something I'd love to work towards. After all, right now, MI still is a new player on this field, but who knows where we'll be in a couple of years' times.

We have a solid base, something my mom, dad and Sirius worked for back when MI was founded. It went to a bit of a low burn when the war was fully in play and stopped for a year when my parents were murdered. Remus became the primary contact person after Sirius went to prison, so a lot couldn't be done while he was in England.

But these last 5 years we've been making a name for ourselves and getting the right kind of attention to play the big games now too.""

Remus hummed, ""I think, Harry, that's because of you, for a large part, you are not afraid to help out businesses who are close to the ground, but have great ideas and just need someone to sponsor that idea.""

Pepper added, ""also people like someone who supports or has a charity organisation under their name, it given them some humanity. Tony gets the same good publicity for the Maria Stark-foundation.""

This had both Remus and Harry humming, using the time before dinner to put some ideas on paper. Before Dora entered the dining room again, Teddy trailing after her to take a seat when she floated the pots and pans to the table and snatched away the paper Remus and Harry were writing on.

""No work on the dining table, and Harry you're not officially at work yet. It's still you vacation time, enjoy it. I will put this away and leave it on your desk in the morning, for you to continue on, after your vacation days are up.""

Meekly nodding at that, both Remus and Harry had to stifle giggles about how much Dora looked like her mother at that time. Andromeda Tonks nee Black might be an older witch, but she was still a Black and one that knew her way around household spells and disciplinary curses.

Which she no doubt taught to Dora before she went to America. Blacks were known for their excellent spell work after all.

As they settled at the table and got their fill of the amazing dinner Dora had made, Harry made sure to spend some time with Teddy after they ate, until the little guy went to bed.

He drove Pepper to her apartment back in the city, agreeing to meet again the day after - he hadn't really taken a lot of clothes with him from England, planning on shopping for those things here in the USA, hoping to enjoy doing that with Pepper.

Coming home after, he changed into his Pyjama, and went to bed, the jetlag finally catching up with him.

 

The week of vacation was over before Harry really knew what was happening, he spends a good portion of that week clothes shopping, or shopping for things to put in his office or in his room at the house.

When they weren't doing that, he and Pepper were walking through the city, the redhead pointing out everything from good places to get coffee, to fine dining establishments, to the Juwelier Tony went to, to get his Rolex working again.

On Thursday, after some time bugging Pepper, she invited Happy to the Black estate to properly introduce him to her extended family.

While he was a very different type of person than Colin was, he was obviously very taken with Pepper and would give her the moon and stars, should she ask. Which to Harry, Remus and Dora was the most important part.

They did however scare Happy for a bit when they told him he had 5 other older brothers to convince in time, should he ever consider wanting to marry Pepper. He had assured them he would keep that in mind, but as they hadn't been dating for that long, he hadn't given that any thought yet.

Remus and Harry could respect that, it was one thing to have a relationship without thinking about the future. Or having a relationship and thinking about the future, but still enjoying the now instead of already planning years ahead.

After seeing Happy out of the door and taking Pepper home, she thanked him and Remus and Dora for doing this for her. She knew she would never be able to introduce Happy to her mother not with the way Molly was acting.

And introducing him to Arthur could only be done after the man grew the balls to leave his wife.

Her brothers were a fact, and she had mentioned this to Happy, that should he ever ask her to marry him, he had to ask her brothers, all of them, for their approval.

Harry had pressed a kiss to her hair at that, knowing just how much it hurt for Pepper to have a mother who already had planned out your entire life - only to see that crumble when things didn't turn out that way and take out her frustrations on anyone but herself.

Not only that, but what grown woman expected her adult children to stay in the home they grew up in, only to make her feel better. Which wasn't that big of a problem the first month, as they all are enjoying having family close while they grieved. Both after months of being cooped up at home, Molly still hadn't relented nor allowed any of her children to leave, even those who had their own home.

When Ginny had left, the others had soon followed. Ron and Hermione, not having a house of their own then, stayed with Harry for the time being until they had their own house.

Which again, was a point Molly used in explaining Harry had turned her own children against her.

 

That Friday however was quite hectic, with the gala taking place that evening for the funding of a new children's hospital, one especially decorated for the enhanced, and magical, children popping up more and more.

A lot of hospitals either weren't equipped to deal with those kids or got backlash and other problems from patients who were anti enhanced or anti mutant. Which as a lot of hate, didn't make sense?

With Pepper, Harry, Remus, and Dora all invited, they had hired one of the company day-care employees to babysit Teddy for the evening.

Saying their goodbye to Clara, said employee, Remus, Dora and Harry all got in the limo who'd take them to the gala - all of them quite looking forward to it, this was the perfect opportunity to get to know other people who didn't have a problem with enhanced and who could potentially become a great partner or ally for MI.

Add to the fact that this would be the first outing any of the board members of MI had ever done, hoping to get a lot of attention on that too, now that Harry was set to become CEO and they was taken 5 years to get MI to a level they had wanted to be at.

Lastly, they were also looking forward to meeting Tony Stark, as Pepper had told them he'd be present too.

          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Tony and Pepper, as always got quite the attention when they arrived, for once on time - but then again Pepper had made sure Tony didn't need to do anything for a week, just concentrate on his own project and enjoy the time he got to spend with his bots and brain.

The last thing he could do was to be on time for this one event at the end of the week, which was to finance a new children's hospital to take care, especially, of children from enhanced or children who were enhanced themselves whom other hospitals couldn't, or wouldn't, take care of.

The vultures descended on them the moment they got out of the Stark Company car, Happy for once not driving, as he had a day off today. But with Pepper at his side and so many people around them, he wasn't all that afraid of anyone trying something.

The vultures however, where a very different story, shoving their mics and cameras into their faces the moment they stepped onto the red carpet, asking everything from SI related questions, to a personal question about their relationship (which was not, and would never happen - even if they wouldn't tell that to the media), as well as questions directed to Pepper about the strange, but handsome man she had been seen with this past week.

Most questions, personal ones at least, were ignored and not answered. Tony stopped for a moment with a reporter from some science magazine who had some intelligent questions about the new Stark Phone that was about to come out in 2 months' time.

Entering the banquet hall, both Pepper and Tony mingled with their acquaintances, such as Dr. Stephen Strange and Dr. Christine Palmer, both known for their ground-breaking work in neurosurgery. Dr. Strange in particular was invested in the health and care of enhanced children - his younger sister had been an enhanced, but with the mindset of people back then, she was not helped when she was ill and died from pneumonia.

Stephen had once told them that the death of his sister was the reason, he became a doctor, to help people no matter who they were different groups too much to put up with.

Other acquaintances included Professor Charles Xavier, Dr. Reed Richards (even if he and Tony didn't always see eye to eye) and Jennifer Walters.

As they were catching up, both Christine, Susan, as well as Ororo and Jean asked Pepper about the man she had been seen with this last week.

Pepper laughed, knowing that all of the people in this circle knew she and Tony were not an item, and would never be.

""He is my best friend from back home, he needed to take care of some things in the UK, but he finally was able to come overseas and take over as CEO for his own company.""

At the questionable humming from all her girlfriends, Pepper elaborated, ""He's the new CEO of Marauder Inc., taking over from his godfather now that he has moved to the states.""

Christine whistled, ""he's doing great things, I know a lot of his medical supplies help us with more enhanced patients, where normal supplies just don't cut it.""

Pepper nodded, ""I know, he really likes helping others, made it his business to have as many departments as possible to make sure he can actively help with making the world a better place. Also, if you'd check his HR records, you'd find that MI has the highest record of enhanced employees than anywhere else in the world.

They're doing better than SI on that field, not to mention the things he would do for his employees.""

She told them what had happened at the rental agency, and later what had happened with Carol and Charlotte; and the way Harry solved it, in such a Harry kind of way.

All the women cooed at that, none of them had children at this moment, but she knew Susan and Reed wanted to start a family soon, so to hear a CEO thinking far enough ahead to make sure that his employees who were all rather young, had an in-company day-care, was very refreshing to hear.

Susan smiles as she asked, ""his parents must be very proud.""

Pepper winced, ""We don't know, they died when he was a toddler, his godfather, Remus, is the only one from the founders of MI who is still alive. We try not to bring it up, seeing as we won't be able to answer those questions - if they would be proud of Harry.

We're assuming they would be, so very proud, but we can't know for sure.""

Susan frowned, a hand on her heart, ""why is it that genius, and amazing people have such tragic pasts.""

Pepper shrugged, although her eyes did rest on Tony for a second, thinking about that question. She felt so bad for both her best friends that to make it, and to be able to be so great, they first had to lose everything. And even than it took years for people to recognize then as their own people, instead of the son of...

She was beyond proud of both of them, of being able to come out of their father's shadow and make a name for themselves helping the world in their own way.

Seeing a commotion at the entrance, Pepper had to grin, especially when her phone pinged, letting her know the delegation of MI arrived, no doubt causing the vultures to fall over themselves as they recognized the MI company car pulling up and admitting the man they had described as a nobody - it was even funnier, as she knew MI's PR department had a lawsuit ready to sue all of the tabloids for discrediting their CEO, new as he was, the first week he was in the US (great first impression too).

Breaking up the women only talks, they joined their male companions, Pepper letting Tony know that Harry, Remus, and Dora had arrived.

 

As soon as the car stopped in front of the venue the charity gala would take place in, Remus warned Harry about the flashing lights and the yelling from the reporters, which was a good thing the werewolf did. Seeing as soon as the door opened, it looked like the spots of a quidditch stadium were all directed at Harry, as well as enough noise to rival a quidditch match.

People did start to quit down and gape, quite unattractively, as they noticed the same man who had been seen with Pepper Potts throughout the week standing before them.

Only to start another frenzy at trying to get answers out of him, as Potts and Stark had been unwilling to answer questions.

Ignoring them and walking forward at the guidance of Remus' hand on his shoulder, they stopped at a reporter at a business interview, who had asked if Remus was really stepping down as CEO.

Remus had smiled, but nodded, ""I was always acting as stand-in CEO, to be honest. I am actually the CFO of MI, have been since my best friends founded it. However, their son, Harry, still had some businesses to take care of back in the UK, so I agreed to stand in as CEO for as long as needed.

Now, since Harry has finally graced us with his presence here in the USA, I will gladly step down and let him, officially handle everything pertaining MI.""

When the interviewer asked what he meant by that, Remus elaborated, ""Harry has been the genius behind every change and product MI had fabricated for the last 5 years, he was just never around to actually see it happening - too busy taking care of his investments in the UK to come over to America full time. Now that he has, I don't see why I shouldn't credit him for all the things he has done.""

When asked about Pepper, Harry answered, saying that, ""they were old friends who hadn't seen each other in real life for 5 years, of course they would use that time to hang out like old times. I was kind of disappointed that tabloids here in America don't really do research before printing their pictures, so I'm sure they'll think twice from now on, when my legal team comes knocking with a legal suit - I am still on the fence on what to think about America.""

Turning to Remus, he casually asked, ""I'm sure we could relocate, should there be a need to, to a country who does thinks before they write slander and lies into their papers.""

Without commenting further, Harry walked towards the entrance, a smirk on his face, one mirrored to a lesser degree by Remus and Dora, they both remembered the way Harry had dealt with the Prophet when the war was over and they had started writing about everything in his life again.

The paper had gotten sued within an inch of its life, enabling Xeno Lovegood to buy the paper and change it to an actually readable newspaper - bringing news like a normal Muggle newspaper did it, from everyday news, to politics, business deals and the results in the latest quidditch match.

Right now, it was more popular than the former Prophet ever was.

As they entered, Harry let his eyes run over the crowd, only stopping when he saw Pepper and the good looking man next to her, which he knew was Tony Stark.

 

When Pepper let him know that the delegation from Marauders Inc., had finally arrived, he couldn't help but look over at the door, noticing that everyone around them seemed to do the same.

The first people entering, was obviously a couple: he was approaching 50 with grey in his tawny brown hair, and very noticeable amber coloured eyes. He stood at a respectable length of 6'1, with a lean build, especially for a person his age.  He was dressed in a dark brown suit, with a purple shirt and a creamy coloured tie.

The woman on his arm was closer to 35, than to 40, but seemed to be young in spirit, going on from her pixy cut hairstyle, which was black with pink tips. Her eyes, a very otherworldly grey, were looking at the man with a lot of love in her eyes. She was also quite a bit shorter than her husband, standing at 5'4, with delicate curves, dressed in a purple gown with a high neck, almost like a halter neckline, leaving her arms bare as it fitted tightly around her breasts and waist, before flaring out in a full skirt.

The last person to enter, was the one who got the most attention, totally deserved it too.

Hadrian Black stood at 6'2, a little taller than he himself was, with a lean build, even if he suspected those clothes to hide quite a bit of muscle, his black hair at chin length - yet styled away from his face. His vivid green eyes were scanning the room, and he could see it when he noticed Pepper, the laughter dancing behind those greens making them all the more memorable to look at.

He was dressed in a black three piece suit, with a purple shirt, no doubt to colour coordinate with his godfather and aunt, a black tie and looked totally delicious in it.

As if reading his mind, Pepper turned and glared at him when she saw the look on his face, a hissed, 'don't you think about it, I will not be yanked between my two best friends because you couldn't keep it in your pants.'

Tony just nodded, he too didn't want this to be a one time thing, he wanted to get to know Hadrian Black, both as a competitor, but also as Pepper's other best friend. He already felt that they would and could be friends, given time. He had to wait until Friday, even though he knew the man was in the country since Monday, to introduce himself in a way that would make him memorable - too many people believed the tabloids and wouldn't give him the time of day, even if he was genuine interested in becoming acquainted with them. From what Pepper had told him, Hadrian wouldn't be like that, giving him hope to add another interesting friend to his already wide circle of interesting friends.

Seeing Pepper further down the hall, Harry made eye contact with Remus and nodded towards her, with a smile and a nod the older men waved him off, going back to talking with the senator, as well as the spokes person of the local magical community.

Taking a few steps towards where Pepper, Tony, and their friends were gathered, he could feel the looks of others on his back. Their scrutiny no doubt ending the moment they read tomorrow just who he actually was.

Getting close to the group, he was suddenly blocked by a brown haired man getting in his way.

The man was a little older than him, wearing glasses and while a nice suit, it was obviously not right for his body type - not that Harry ever let appearance deceive him, the arrogant way the man was standing in front of him rubbed him the wrong way.

""Yes, can I help you?""

The man grinned, ""Yes, I think you can, you see, I have read the magazines and saw you hanging around with Ms. Potts over there.""

Harry just arched as eyebrow at that, noticing that the man hadn't even introduced himself.

""Yes, and...?""

The man's grin got wider, and if possible creepier, ""I'm afraid I'll have to burst your bubble and tell you she is a committed relationship with Tony Stark, so sadly enough you won't stand a chance.""

Harry's eyebrow only arched higher, now disappearing in his hairline, staring at the man as if he had lost his marbles.

Not letting that look deter him the man continued, ""but if you are available, I am more than happy to accompany you today, for the right price of course.""

That last was said while giving Harry a once over, a shiver going over the Potter-Black lord as he minced over the words.

""Are you telling me you think I am some sort of escort?""

The man grinned at him, obviously not knowing just how deeply in the shit he was lowering himself.

Before Harry could reply however, Pepper was standing next to him, Tony not far behind. From the look on the older man's face he had either heard or guessed just what this man had said to him.

""Are you alright Harry?""

Harry pursed his lips, a look of contempt on his face, queuing Pepper that something had been said that didn't go over well with her best friend. Turning to the other man, she addressed him.

""Justin Hammer, just what do you think you are doing?""

Hammer, now finally identified, thank you for that Pepper, gave Harry a once over again, ""well Ms. Potts since you are enjoying the company of Tony here, I offered myself as a companion to your boytoy ever here.""

More than one person had to swallow after that. Tony whispering something in her ear, most likely the fast that Hammer thought Harry was a paid escort.

The brit winced as he saw Pepper turn as red as her hair, knowing the following explosion would be more than Weasley worthy. From the look on Tony's face, he too was familiar with the way Pepper could explode when she felt slighted or insulted.

""Boytoy?""

A whisper came over Pepper's lips, the sheer contempt coming with it making Harry take a few steps back, so he was standing next to Tony Stark and not in the line of fire between Pepper and Hammer.

Like flipping a switch, Pepper suddenly smirked, ""Allow me to introduce you, Harry, this is Justin Hammer, CEO of Hammer Industries and one of the competitors for the weapons division of SI.

Mr. Hammer, please allow he to introduce you to my best friend since secondary school, Lord Hadrian James Potter-Black, holding the lordship of the Potter, Black, Peverell and Gryffindor lordships, presented with the title of Marquis by Her Majesty The Queen on his relentless effort to stop the terrorist attacks plaguing the UK around the year 2000. Co-owner of too many companies to count, and current CEO of Marauder's Inc, the competitor to SI's other divisions.""

When Pepper stopped talking, you could hear a pin drop in the hall they were in, just about everyone looking at all of them, but more notably at Justin Hammer, and the way he had been looking at the new CEO of Marauder Inc.

A slight noise escaped Hammer, before the originator of the charity event approached them and friendly asked Hammer to leave the premises. After, the man, one Dr. Alfred Porter, turned to Harry and apologised for all this happening.

Harry, finally finding his voice, waved it away, ""this has nothing to do with you, Dr. Porter, but everything with the man you just banned from the event. I came here to support a goal I, and my company, want to support and the behaviour of one, pardon my words, asshole, is not going to change that.

Now if you will excuse me, I had hoped to talk to my best friend before the main event.""

Dr. Porter nodded at him, sighing in relief that one of his main benefactors wasn't holding this against him. Turning towards the entrance, he was glad to not see Hammer anymore, the nerve of that man, to speak in such a way towards an English Lord, not only that but on the first charity event he had been invited too. What a way to stay with the people, despicable behaviour.

Nodding once more to Lord Black, he went back towards his own group of friends, excusing himself for his fast departure, only to be hushed by multiple women, them telling him they were happy he interfered. The way Hammer spoke to Lord Black was not even slightly appropriate, not in the circles they were mingling right now.

Alfred nodded, taking a hold of the drink his wife had been holding for him and sighed.

When someone tapped his shoulder however, he turned and found himself staring at Remus and Nymphadora Black-Lupin, Lord Black's closest relatives and until tonight the representatives of Marauder Inc.

""I would like to thank you for acting on behalf of my nephew, Dr. Porter, and would like to add that beyond the donation we will be making this evening, should you ever be in need of some sturdier equipment, make sure to give us a call.""

As he said this, Remus pressed a business card in his hand, before nodding and turning around, leading his wife to speak with a congressman and a leading expert in mutant genes.

 

Harry blew out a deep breath as they made their way towards the group Pepper had been standing with, a hand on his arm a welcome touch after the confrontation with Hammer.

Taking a glass from a nearby server's tray, he downed it in one go, hoping it would make him feel a bit more at ease. After dealing with UK politics, Molly Weasley, Death Eaters, Voldemort, and the mess up that was the English Ministry of Magic, you would think he could deal with an arrogant businessman who went way beyond his league.

A small giggle escaped Pepper, a fond smile on her face, ""oh, that reminds me. Harry meet Tony Stark, my best American friend. Tony, meet Harry Black, my best English friend.""

The two men shook hands, fond looks directed at the woman walking in between them.

""Nice to meet you, Tony.""

""Likewise, Harry.""

A comfortable silence sprung up between them, until they were back with the group Pepper and Tony had been standing with, more than one person looking at Harry like he was some foreign royalty or something.

A voice suspiciously sounding like Hermione said in his head, 'you kind of are, marquis and all that.'

Pepper always on point, hummed, ""right introductions. Harry meet Professor Charles Xavier, he's the leading authority on mutant genes, as well as the headmaster of the school Remus and Dora are considering sending Teddy to.

Next are two of the school's teachers; Jean Gray and Ororo Munroe. Jean teaches psychology and helps the kids with any problems they might have, while Ororo teaches English.

Then are Susan and Reed Richards, they are part of the Fantastic 4 team protecting New York, as well as our leading experts on interdimensional travel and intergalactic physics.

Lastly, we have Dr. Christine Palmer and Dr. Stephen Strange, both neurosurgeons, with at least one enhanced family member. Both of them are willing to work part time in the new enhanced hospital we are funding tonight.""

Turning towards her other friends, Pepper added, ""everyone, this is Harry Black, current, starting Monday, CEO of Marauder Inc. and my best friend from the UK.""

Harry nodded at everyone he was introduced to, getting smiled and nods back from all of them.

Professor Xavier asked, ""your family is thinking of sending someone to my school.""

Harry nodded, ""Teddy's 5 now, and he goes to a local school that does cater to more enhanced students, but they are also more of a day-care facility and not a real school. With him turning 6 soon, Remus and Dora have been looking into schools that cater to enhanced individuals and yours came out on top.""

The professor smiled at that, happy to know that his institution was known through out the circles it had to be known about and that parents were aware their children were welcome there.

Jean asked, ""Might I ask what his mutation entails?""

Harry nodded, ""he got something like a feral mutation from his father, even if it hasn't manifested yet, we don't know if it ever will. It might set in with puberty.

From his mother he got an easier one, Dora can change her appearance at will, as can Teddy, he has it mostly under control, but as a child it slips his control at times and with the stigma around mutants in certain schools, we'd like it if he could go to a school were his unique ability only makes him more special.""

Pepper snorted, ""it particularly handy when he doesn't want to share his emotions with us, seeing as his hair acts like a mood ring at those times.""

A voice piped up from behind them, ""see Remus, I knew out niece and nephew were talking about us.""

Turning around, Remus and Dora were standing there, grins on their faces. Making both Pepper and Harry snort.

""Like the two of you haven't been talking about us.""

Remus smiled, ""of course we did, one of the youngest CEO's of the country and one of the most sought after PA in the history of PA's, we've been bragging to hell and back about the two of you. As well as confirming that everything that Pepper here said was indeed true. Making it so that a lot of people present today have put Justin Hammer on their Blacklist.""

Tony snorted, ""I am sure with how many phones were out that the world with know what Hammer did and put him on the communal Blacklist. Acting like that here of all places if a stake in his socialite career.""

The people around them nodded, it was indeed social suicide to assume anything of anyone you met at events such as this. And to assume was one thing, but to assume someone was an escort, only to find they outrank you on every side was just downright killing anyone's socialite status.

The group mingled some more, before the speakers announced the start of the main event, a presentation of what the hospital should and would look like once construction was finished, both on the inside as on the outside. As well as what they would be offering in short term and long term care.

Making their way towards the tables assigned, they were pleased to note that Professor Xavier, Ororo and Jean were sitting on the same table as Pepper and Tony, as well as Remus, Dora, and Harry.

Stephen, Christine, Reed and Susan were also at the sale table, accompanied by some other doctors or scientist who either were enhanced or had family that were.

Directing their attention to the front, they were all entertained with a detailed map and plan of, and for, the future hospital for enhanced children.

At the end of the event, Harry was sure he had found a new group of friends to keep in contact with here in America. He of course still had his friends in England, but he also knew that he wouldn't be seeing most of them for some time, as they were all busy with reforming the British Ministry of Magic, as well start their own lives - now that there was no war going on.

From the people Pepper had introduced him to, he got along the least with Stephen Strange, and Christine Palmer, not that he didn't like both. But with both of them being neurosurgeons, the topic of conversations went to medical jargon a lot of times, and this was one thing he never had an interest in.

Susan and Reed Richards were a very strange couple, in the fact that it seemed that they didn't fit together at first glance, until you got to know them, and then it all made sense. Sue was the very social part of that pairing, always knowing what to say and enjoying attention when she got it. Reed on the other hand was a bit of a socially awkward nerd, but he always followed Sue's guidance, so it didn't matter that much.

Professor Xavier, as well as Jean and Ororo were people he admired, mostly because they invested in the next generation, especially a part of the next generation that might not be welcomed elsewhere. To hear from themselves, just what they had to go through, and the troubles they had gone through at the start of the school, was only awe inspiring. Add to that, that the X-man, consisting of most of the teachers, and quite a part of the off-age students, did everything they could do when a situation with an enhanced went out of hand.

Remus and Dora had spoken some more with the professor, as well as with both teachers, and had agreed to come and enjoy a tour, as well as an introduction to the other teachers, and some students. Their minds were already made up, but they did want to be sure, seeing as the school was on the other side of the country.

This would mean they would look for a property closer to New York, as to not have to scramble up Teddy's schedule more than was needed, Dora and Remus could work with the 3 hour time difference, knowing that Harry wouldn't mind them doing part of the work from home, to pop over to HQ after they dropped off Teddy at school.

Now, the person Harry connected the most with was Tony Stark, which shouldn't be all that surprising seeing how well Pepper got along with him. Tony, to Harry, was a very intellectual conversationalist, they could both talk about their companies, as well as their policies and the view of the future they had for their company, and for their own lives.

Pepper had only smiled secretive as they both got lost in talks about their new lines of phones, between the Stark Phone, which Harry had to admit was an advanced piece of electronics.

Yet, Tony was also singing praises over the new Marauder Phone, with its durability and the magical component which allowed magical inclined to use it, without it blowing up.

Before talking business, and more specifically the magical side of things. Harry had asked Pepper if Tony was up to date, to which the redhead had replied that he indeed was. Back when she first came to work as his PA, he had done, or tried to do, a background search, but seeing as Pepper Potts hadn't existed long enough, he hadn't found any real information.

While she'd been able to keep him at a distance about that for some time. The moment they started to become friends, next to being boss and employee, Pepper had gotten all the correct paperwork in order and had given Tony a class in Magic 101. Much to his delight, even if he had tried to explain most of what had been happening by science. Both of them had a very fun weekend with Pepper explaining and showing anything Tony had asked, and Tony giving his own explanation to everything, as well as a closer bond between the two of them.

So, Harry knew he was all right with telling Tony about the magical component of the new Marauder phone, he had erected a privacy barrier first though, not that anyone had noticed; and if anyone did, they most likely thought it was because of some mutant gene.

At the end of the night, Tony had invited Harry to his Malibu mansion, to talk it all over some more - after all, while Harry didn't have the IQ Tony had, he was a very enjoyable conversations partner, and it helped that he knew Harry wasn't some gold digger out for the Stark fortune. He hadn't been able to find back statements, but he had asked Pepper once, and she had told him Harry was worth more than he was, and that was quite the statement.

The evening had also ended on a joyous note, the money needed for the new hospital had been gathered, with some extras. So Dr. Porter had come personally to thank Marauder Inc., and Stark Industries for their contribution, knowing both companies had given the greatest contribution.

Dr. Porter was also pleasantly surprised to find that both companies wouldn't mind donating another time, should they need it. Both CEO's gave him a card and told them to forward an invite should it be needed.

 

The next morning, social media, as well as most of the gossip rags were filled with the confrontation between Pepper Potts and Justin Hammer. As well as more information as to who the mysterious man seen together with Potts was.

Social media in particular was eating Hammer alive, for his behaviour towards Harry, as well as the way he talked to Pepper, as if he one up-ed her over something that he had not done at all.

To add to that, a lot of people saw Pepper as #Goals for the way she defended her friends, and the way she put Hammer in his place. More than one woman magazine had contacted the redhead for an interview, and several online forums were declaring her a hero for being a strong and confident woman in a man's world, not afraid to say what needed to be said.

With Pepper's introduction the gossips rags were also cowed at the words they had written about him, Tony had however warned that they changed opinions, faster than the snap of a finger, so to look out for them, as they would write dirt about him the moment they even suspected it.

Tony had shared with him, that as a teen, just graduated from MIT at 16, and taking over as head of R&D, he had partied a lot, mostly to deal with the changes in his life, as well as a bad coping mechanism for everything that went wrong. Anyway, that image this followed him everywhere, meaning that the moment they saw him leaving with anyone it was his newest conquest, just as the moment he was seen with a drink in hand, he was losing himself to booze once more.

Several forums, as well as people on social media were speculating what a multiple British Lord was doing in America, at least until statements from MI were released, putting the company in America all the way back to the 1990's, having been founded by Harry's parents, and their best friends.

While it didn't calm down, Harry had learned to ignore it by Monday, fresh and ready to start his new adventure as CEO of MI.

Tony was so glad Pepper had introduced her other best friend to him, not only was the man a great conversation partner, but be was also good looking. The moment however, Pepper had seen the look in his eyes, she had talked to him in the car on their way home from the fundraiser. Telling him that she couldn't dictate what he did, but if he screwed this up, she would choose her longest friend.

He had nodded and put it onto a backburn. He was attracted to the Brit, but wanted to get to know him better, as a friend first. Not that he doubted Pepper, but it wouldn't be the first time he thought he connected to someone, only to have them do a complete 180 the moment he had either slept with them or wanted to begin a relationship with that other person.

Being known by the media since he was a child, also held a lot of drawbacks. With the way he had appeared at his parent's sides back when they were still alive, as well as in magazines for as long as he remembered, people were undoubtedly going to form an opinion of him, even if that opinion was formed on the things they had read in magazines and on the internet.

He had thanked Pepper for the great evening, before dropping her off at her apartment, glad two of his friends were happy together. They might not know it, but he had recognized Happy's car out front, as well as the way both of them looked at the other when they thought he wasn't looking.

He thought it sweet that they actually thought they could hide this from him, but he would wait for them to tell this to him, on their own time.

Driving, for him, however, was bliss, especially after spending it with so many people who saw through his mask and knew the real Tony. Even if he and Reed didn't see eye to eye on most things, the man was a friend when it counted, and when he needed one.

At home, he entered his workshop and called out to his bots and JARVIS.

Asking his AI to start a folder, on his private server to see where SI and MI could potentially co-operate in the future. He wanted to keep it quiet first, as to make sure he had a whole plan, and of course Harry's approval before he put anything forward to the board.

Partnering with another tech company might just satisfy the old bastards, and Obie, if he could present a better way to use their resources, as right now a lot still went to the weapons division, as no one, except for him and Pepper, wanted to change that.

Don't fix what isn't broken, of however the saying goes, even if he never felt comfortable with making so many weapons. He'll look it over, hopefully he'll be able to present a plan to the board in about 6 months, he'd have that weapons demo in Afghanistan then, pertaining their new Jericho missile.

Closing off, he nodded to himself, he'd give himself just under 6 months to let the board see that going more towards electronics was a better solution, than only concentrating, or mostly concentration on weapons development. Weapons might not be needed anymore in the future, but the futurist in him knew that they electronics, and technology would stay long, very long, after their time.

In, or around, LA, two men spend their weekends thinking back fondly about the new friendships they made at a charity gala of all things. Looking forward to what this would all bring them I the future, especially with the slow marching of different societies, enhanced weren't staying hidden and it was time the world accounted for that.

What neither knew however, was that in 6 months, the world would get to know something else, something only minorly mainstream right now, something that would kickstart a lot of event in the future.

Death could only smile, knowing her Merchant, and her Master had met. Now they had to meet in a slightly more secluded setting, and she could explain it all to them. Soon she would see them making a name for themselves, as Earth's Defenders.

Harry couldn't help but look around in awe at the entrance hall of Tony's Malibu mansion. They had agreed to meet up a few weekends after the gala, to see if a partial merge between MI and Si could be in their future.

After all, both of them were entrepreneurs in their field, not to forget that neither did this to make big money, as shown by the prices they put on their products, which still sold like hot buns. Not only that, but both Harry and Tony did a lot of what they did as philanthropists, to actually help the world with their progress.

Tony had also at one point told him that he wanted to shut down his weapons division, even if it was the biggest, because he didn't feel like it helped the world like he wanted to help it. If anything, war just became more brutal, with Stark products becoming only more effective, feeding the endless circle.

They had been in contact quite a lot after the benefit, having exchanged numbers and keeping each other posted on things that happened in their private lives as well.

Harry, for example, had shared the story of how Remus and Dora's visit to Xavier's instate had gone, and how exited they had been when coming back. Having met most of the teachers, as well as some full time residenting students, to see just how well Teddy would fit into the school. The answer was very well.

The fees were paid, and Teddy was ready to start school in Xavier's institute in a few months' time, giving Remus and Dora enough time to look for a home closer to North Salem.

Tony had in return told Harry about the weapon's presentation he would have to hold in little less than 6 months' time in Afghanistan, hoping it to be the last one he had to do, as he doesn't plan on renewing his contracts with the military. He hoped that coming with plans of a partial merger, or concrete ideas for products which had both MI and SI working on them, would turn over his board of directors to not see the loss of the weapons division as a major defeat for SI.

In fact, those plans had been why Harry was here, standing in this gorgeous entrance hall in the first place. He had agreed on doing that, partly because a cooperation between SI and MI would give him more acknowledgement, and because he liked working with Tony, or would like to do so, his gut feeling was telling him the both of them could be at the head of quite some changes in the near future.

JARVIS had already welcomed Harry to the mansion and told him that 'sir' will be right there. Which for Harry had been quite the shock, Tony had told him about his AIs, but to actually hear and interact with one was magnificent.

When tony did appear, it was in a grease stained pair of jeans, and an old ACDC shirt, a smile on his face.

""Sorry for the wait, Harry, I was fixing up one of my old timers and forgot to keep an eye on the time.""

Harry just dismissed it with a wave of his hand, ""I really don't mind, Tony, I know I can get distracted at times too. What kind of car are your working on?""

Tony stopped for a moment, ""you don't mind?""

Harry shook his head with a smile, ""why should I? I already know you are a genius, so your brain must be going 100 miles an hour, every hour of the day. If you can get it to quiet down while working on your car collection, who am I to have a problem with that - self-care is important you know.""

Tony just smiled, like he couldn't believe he had someone in his life, as a friend, that didn't mind him forgetting or being late to an appointment, for the exact reason Harry had described. Pepper and Rhodey were the only other people who understood that he didn't arrive late to make a statement, but because his brain had something it wanted to figure out, and the only way to make it stop bugging him was to figure the thing out.

""And to answer your question, it's a vintage Austin Martin. Recently bought it at an auction, and I'm restoring it as a hobby.""

Harry hummed, ""yeah, Pepper did say you had multiple degrees, with one in engineering.""

Tony nodded, ""also several doctorates.""

Harry hummed and smiled, seeing just how proud Tony actually was of his academic accomplishments, which he should be, no other 16 year old could graduate MIT with 3 PHDs and several other degrees, masters, or bachelors.

Suddenly, Tony shivered, ""JARVIS, turn on the heating.""

When there was no answer, Tony started looking around, hoping that the AI wasn't damaged, or there wasn't anything else going on.

Harry looked around too, noticing something outside that made him sigh.

""Tony, JARVIS is alright, the outside world was brought to a standstill, we are for lack of terms, trapped in a bubble outside of space and time at the moment, if you look outside, you can see some of the birds just hanging in mid-air, instead of flying.""

Tony looked outside, and saw the same thing Harry had seen, making him look back at the wizard, still in worry.

""So, this is something magical, then? Did you get followed or tracked down, or...?""

A voice suddenly spoke to them, ""My master has nothing to do with this, My Merchant, I captured the both of you in this space-time bubble, for I need to speak with you.""

Harry sighed, a grumbled, ""I should have known"", passing from his lips as he turned around.

""Hello, Lady Death.""

A figure seemed to materialise before Tony's eyes, a dark hood covering her features, for the voice that spoke had been undoubtably female. A cloak also covered her hands, although a scythe appeared in one of them as she materialised fully.

""I remember you...""

Death smiled at the American, ""I am glad that you do, My Merchant, you spend enough time in my realm to know who I am.""

Tony paled, no doubt remembering all the times he had met Lady Death, as she had explained to Harry, he had visited her quite often before. She had wanted to see the both of them together at one time, to tell them something, but also to make sure her Merchant remembered.

""But I'm alive now, right?""

Both Harry and Lady Death nodded, making Tony look at Harry, ""you knew something about this?""

Harry shrugged, ""I knew there was her Merchant, and her Champion, here in the USA, but I didn't know who they were, no. So, just to be fair, I didn't befriend you because I knew this. I was made aware of who you were, at the same time you were made aware of who I was.""

Tony hummed, still not knowing what to think of all this.

""I never told My Master of who you were, Anthony Stark, the fact that the both of you have bonded so quickly is party because of the nature of your bond to me, indeed, but also because both of you are compatible, in more ways than one, outside of the bond all three of us share.""

""Then why come out, and tell us now?""

""Because it is vital for the survival of this world that you meet. I cannot tell you more at this given time, seeing as I too am bond to certain secrets. But I can tell you that together you both will have a much better chance to conquer that which will come on your path.""

Harry frowned, ""does this have anything to do with the alien that thinks he is courting you?""

Lady Death sighed, but nodded, ""it does.""

Tony looked between Harry and Lady Death, a questionable look in his eyes.

Harry sighed, ""long story short, some lone survivor of an alien race has got it into his head that by wiping out half the universe, he can win the affection of Lady Death, he has gone from planet to planet to kill off half the population, and leave the other half be.

He's still a long way from Earth, but I know we need to keep an eye on him in case he might take more drastic measures.""

At this Lady Death looked away, making Harry frown, ""he had, or he will, in the near future then.""

""I cannot say, My Master.""

Harry huffed, but nodded, knowing that some truths have to remain hidden, even from his as the Master of Death.

Tony looked between the two of them, ""what does this have to do with me then?""

Lady Death smiled, ""I gave you the name of Merchant of Death, after the many times you have visited me, unwillingly, yet never afraid to be in my presence. Just as my Master and my Champion, I granted you boons, one of which is your durability. There will be other boons, but they are not needed yet, so they will not show.""

Tony swallowed, a pained look on his face, ""the press me the Merchant of Death as well, but that's because of the impact my weapons have on the planet and the warfare still going on.""

Lady Death nodded, ""I did not give you that name to imitate that, you were given that name the second time you entered my realm.""

Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times, ""so, when I was 6? At the second kidnapping gone wrong.""

Lady Death nodded, a sad smile on her face. Harry was looking between Lady Death and Tony.

""Wait, how many times has he visited you, then?""

Lady Death thought for a moment, ""15 times.""

Harry blinked, before approaching Tony, ""you died 15 times already?""

Tony nodded, a little uncomfortable, ""yeah, I had a lot of kidnappings done when I was a child and seeing as my f... as Howard never paid, the people kidnapping me sometimes went to drastic Measures. There was also and accident, where I wasn't the one driving where I didn't have a pulse for about 5 minutes. And I think one or two, fairly recent, where assassins got a hold of me.""

Lady Death nodded, ""that should be all of them indeed, but I never let you stay in my realm, knowing you didn't belong and were needed here, are still needed here, and will be needed here for a long time to come.

I made this bubble to make sure you both knew what the other was, as events will be set into motion soon that would be more pleasant if the both of you had each other to lean on.""

Tony and Harry looked at each other, before looking at Death, ""I think we were getting on quite nicely before too.""

Lady Death nodded, ""indeed, but your cooperation, and the ideas already on the table for a semi-merger can save both of you a lot of trouble in a few years. I needed to give you both the last push to connect on this level, and to know that the both of you, and one other, are bound in a way that hasn't been seen since ancient times.""

Harry nodded, ""I'll fill Tony in on that soon enough, does this mean we also have full disclosure on everything and anything?""

Lady Death nodded, ""My Merchant will not be affected by anything you do with your powers, and vice versa, My Master. So, this gives you a place to do practice, without harming anyone.""

At Tony's look Harry explained that he had known what he was since he was 17, about 5 years ago, but he never could act on those powers, or use them, seeing as he could harm others with it. He was also always in the presence of someone else who could be hurt by those powers, so he just didn't want to risk it.

""Now that you have met, some powers or boons might manifest, and some others will not. I cannot tell you this.""

With a last smile, Lady Death bid the both of them goodbye before everything started moving like it should again.

""I'll turn up the heating, sir, although it is a nice 21 degrees Celsius right now.""

 

IM1

 

The first hour after Lady Death had visited them were slightly awkward, after all who wouldn't be unsure of what to say when you were just visited by a primordial being. Those things didn't happen every day.

""Does Pepper know?""

Harry looked up as Tony asked him this, but nodded, ""most of my friends in the UK know, since when she accepted me as her Master, so did the magic of the function.""

Harry gave a soft sigh, ""you have to know that I didn't have the best home life growing up, I was dropped with my mother's sister and her family. Who knew what magic was but hated and feared it. My childhood wasn't a good one, and one I later came to see as abusive.

But that notwithstanding, I was a scrawny little thing even at 17, I was short for my age, with almost no muscle build, and the same haircut for the last 15 years. But accepting, and being accepted, by Death's magic, it changed me. I grew taller seemingly overnight, my hair started growing again, and I filled out. So, I knew I had to tell some people what was really going on.

Already people were pointing their fingers at me, convinced I had drabbled in dark magic and that the effect of that magic was showing now. It also didn't help that I and my friends were trying to change things in the Wizarding World in the UK, changes that a lot of people didn't like because they went against the things they were used to.

Blaming me seemed the best solution for some of them, so I had to come up with a solution of my own. I told Pepper before she left for America, together with my best friends, Ron, Pepper's brother, and Hermione, Ron's wife.

Together we were able to explain that I had been taking a potions regimen to counter the signs of abuse I'd carry with me whole my life. This got a lot of people to back down, especially when it was backed by most of the people I went to school with. The only others who kept believing I was grooming myself to be the next Dark Lord were finally silenced when I moved here.""

Tony tilted his head, ""how can they be silenced by your moving here?""

Harry grimaced, ""because I sold everything I had in the UK, liquified every asset I had, and publicly announced I would never show up in England ever again. MI does not have any holdings there, which will be something that they'll find out soon enough.

I... it seemed to be the best solution at the time, seeing as my friends and family can still come and visit me here, or we can meet up in Europe. But I had enough of the UK, and especially the Wizarding World there, and felt it best to start a new life here, in America.""

Tony frowned; he couldn't understand how Harry had essentially let himself be bullied out of his home country. Not for something like this.

""Because the main voice behind me turning into a Dark Lord, is Pepper's mother. She had it into her head that Pepper and I would marry, and she would get beautiful grandchildren who unlike her family, would have money to spare.

But we didn't because we never saw each other that way. I'm gay, and not at all interested in a relationship with a woman. And Pepper just always saw me as another brother, after her first year at school at least, and didn't see herself married to me either.

Her mother disagreed with a lot of things, even tried to keep every one of her children, and in-laws, away from me by forbidding them from leaving the house. Partly because of me, partly because she had lost a child to the previous dark lord, as well as Pepper's fiance, and didn't want to lose anyone else.""

Tony looked at him with giant eyes, ""that's a very difficult woman, I imagine.""

Harry nodded, ""all her children don't speak to her anymore, not after what she did to them, and especially not after how she did to me. They all moved away and refuse to see her, or their father, unless he files for divorce, which he'll probably never do.""

Tony whistled lowly, ""that's some life you got away from.""

Harry nodded, ""I really just want to focus on MI right now, to be honest, to do my best to provide a future for the world. Especially with the hints Lade Death has given, we are going to need an edge.""

The rest of their planning session went great, and both Tony and Harry had several plans to show to their own boards about a future, near future, collaboration between MI and SI.

They met up several times in the course of the six months before they wanted to present their findings and plans. Which lead to Tony introducing his business partner, who had been his father business partner as well, Obadiah Stane.

Which didn't go so well, Harry could see the way the older man looked at the both of them, but also the way he looked at Tony when the genius wasn't watching, which concerned him greatly.

After Stane had left, and Harry mentioned this to Tony, the other man had waved it off, telling him that Obie was just a shark who wanted the best for the company, as well as for him, as his godson.

This had Harry wincing even more, as Teddy's godfather, he knew that if he ever looked at Teddy like that, he wouldn't be allowed to see the little kid again. It really worried him, and made him push through, which in turn made Tony angry at him.

He backed off then but did warn Pepper about what he had seen and what he thought might be going on, even if he hoped to all primordial beings that this wasn't the case.

With both of them taking space from one another and concentrating on their own project that needed to be launched, it took some time before they saw each other again. As a matter of fact, Tony delayed his own flight to Afghanistan, to be able to talk to Harry before he left.

They talked it over, and Tony promised to be careful, now and in the future, even if he didn't think that Obie would ever try and harm him.

Harry would stay in the workplace for the entire night, talking things over, but also sharing what had happened in both their lives, while the other didn't appear in it.

Harry very enthusiastically told Tony of how well Teddy's first week as Xavier's institute had went, and how happy he was that he didn't need to hide that part of himself anymore. He had told them all about his teachers and the other students, and how odd a lot of students found it that he just went home again at the end of the day. Until they found out both his parents also had a 'mutation'.

However, Dora and Remus had found out that working with a 3 hour difference still brought trouble for them. So, they had written Andromeda, Dora's mother, and asked her if she wanted to move in with them.

The older woman had been alone since the passing of her husband in the war but hadn't wanted to leave initially. But now, with all of her close family in the States, she had been all for it, especially since she would be the one picking up Teddy at his school and spending some time with all of them at the house in New York.

Harry tried to come over as much as possible, but he still held the house in LA, and with MI's headquarters also there, he didn't want to move everything to New York, at least not yet.

 

Tony on his part had told Harry about the new weapons the board was pushing for, which he was delaying, as to make sure that he wouldn't need to make them, as they were planning on announcing their collab soon enough.

The military had similarly approached him an effort to renew the contract they had running. Even sending his best friend Rhodey to try and talk him into signing early, which didn't help, seeing as he had told Rhodey everything about what he had been doing, and the airman had agreed that waiting for a bit was the best option.

He also shared that he had told Rhodey about him, Harry, and his oldest friend had expressed a desire to meet the man who had become so close to Tony in such a short time, without any negative intentions.

Harry proposed they all come over to his house and he'd cook if Tony would like. Tony having tasted Harry's cooking, didn't see anything wrong with that and agreed, after sending a text to Rhodey to ask if the man could get some days off as soon as they returned from Afghanistan.

Plans were made, and their talks were only disturbed quite a few hours later when Pepper entered the room and chastised Tony for not already being on a plane halfway around the world. The Stark just waved it off, saying it was his plane, so they'd wait for him to get there before taking off.

This in turn made Pepper sigh and turn to Harry, chastising him for keeping Tony talking so long, so they were behind on schedule.

The Brit had just shrugged, before also inviting Pepper and Happy, who finally confessed to Tony that they were dating. To the surprise of no one, even Tony had admitted to already knowing, but wanting to let them come to him with that news.

Pepper agreed, before chasing Tony out of the workshop and into the shower, stating that Happy was ready to leave at any moment, but Tony smelled so he had to take a shower first.

 

Which brought us to roughly a week later, where Harry was putting the finishing touched to the meal, he was preparing for his guests later that evening. He hadn't gotten a text yet, but Tony had said he'd be home and in La in time for dinner.

So, when his phone did go off, he picked up without checking who it was, and instantly regretted it. Pepper was on the other end, her voice filled with emotions and tears, telling him there had been a situation in Afghanistan.

Harry turned down the fire and slowly sat down, listening as Pepper told him what Rhodey told her; that they had been in separate vehicles. That Tony's had been attacked and the people he had rode with killed, their bodies accounted for.

Only Tony had been nowhere around, no body to be found, and no live Tony Start running towards then either. Best case scenario he turned up soon, but worst case terrorists had gotten to them and had kidnapped him.

With no lead, and no extra support, Rhodey was coming back to American soil, to arrange extra forces and ask for permission to go and look for Tony Stark in the Afghan dessert, knowing that the ending might not be pretty.

The other side of the line became silent, before Pepper talked again, ""Harry, I know you don't like using that part of your powers, but... can you check, if he's at least alive?""

Harry hummed, he knew Tony was still alive, because his status as Merchant of Dead he could only die when Lady Death herself reaped him, which she already said she wouldn't do. But he couldn't tell Pepper that, Tony should be the one to tell her that.

Sighing, he answered, ""I will, look that is, and keep you posted if I find anything or hear anything through... other channels than the one you and Rhodes are using.""

He could hear the smile in Pepper's voice as she thanked him, making him run a hand through his hair and place a statis charm over the food he had prepared. He wasn't hungry anymore, but maybe someone else could benefit from it.

The first few days after he had heard about Tony getting kidnapped in Afghanistan left him feeling slightly empty, one of his best friends here in America, as well as someone he had a crush on, had been taken while protected by the US Armed troops, by a group of terrorists no one know the hiding place of.

To make matters worse, Lady Death hadn't been able to answer his call, too busy with the destruction of a planet on the other side of the universe. His heart, and the bond they shared with her let him know Tony was still alive, but he couldn't feel that out on his own and needed Lady Death to confirm this for him.

It was roughly a week after the first news, that Lady Death did appear next to him, a grim look on her face.

""He is alive.""

Harry looked at her, ""that doesn't sound very reassuring.""

Lady Death looked down, ""he will be forever changed by what he experienced and will experience there in those caves. It will help to have a support system ready for when he gets back.""

Harry lifted an eyebrow, ""so he will come back?""

Lady Death nodded, ""Tony Stark always made his own way from where the kidnappers held him, this time will be no different.""

Harry nodded, before calling up Pepper and letting her know they should be looking at caves, but that Tony most likely will make his way out of them.

A month passed with him checking in on Tony, through Lady Death, without any more promising news. Keeping Pepper up to date, while the redhead did the same for him.

She also kept him up to date whit whatever Rhodey found, as they still hadn't met, but wanted to keep the other posted as well, as they were looking for their friend.

About two months after Tony's kidnapping, Harry did notice something strange in the numbers of SI, he had taken to looking at them from time to time, after Tony had shown him how to get to them, and they didn't deem to be adding up.

Frowning he called Pepper again.

""Pep, not Tony related, but have you ever run the numbers of SI again, after you became Tony's assistant?""

The redhead stayed silent on the other end of the phone call, before replying negative, ""no, I didn't. Why?""

So, Harry told her what he was seeing, and how the numbers didn't add up with what was sold, as a matter of fact, for that much money to be coming on, some of SI's supposed scrapped stock would have to be sold?

""And another thing, why don't we hear from Stane? I mean, he is Tony's godfather isn't he, shouldn't he be a little more invested in his godson's life?""

Pepper didn't say anything for a while again, ""I don't know... you do make a point, but with Tony missing, he took over as CEO again, and he seemed all too happy to be doing so.""

Harry hummed, ""I just find it odd that not a week after Tony told Stane what the future plans are, he goes missing, and the other man takes the CEO spot again, just in time to agree on a continuation of the weapons deal with the military, that Tony wanted to stop now that it ends in 2 months' time.""

Pepper clicked her tongue, ""you have a point there.""

Harry shrugged, ""I don't want to point anything at mister Stane, but this all seemed a little bit to planned out for it to be coincidence.""

He could hear Pepper biting her lip, ""I can go and snoop around a bit, see if I can find anything that suggests Stane had a hand in all this. But I wouldn't know what to do with it after, it's not like we can just hand it over to the police, he would pay them off.""

Harry hummed, ""true. Let me ask Professor Xavier if he might know something of government agencies that he knows might be able to deal with this.""

""Alright, keep me posted, Harry.""

Harry confirmed, before saying his goodbyes. Clicking on the number for Professor Xavier, he called and posed him the question. To which the man gave him the number of a certain Phill Coulson of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division, who might be able to help him or point him to someone who could.

Keeping that in mind, Harry got swept up with things at MI, with the launch of their magic proof phones, they had a lot on their hands. It just so happened to be now, that they had planned the launch and he knew Tony wouldn't want him to postpone it. Not when it wasn't needed, he could look for the other CEO on his free time.

Multiple people still came and asked him if he had heard from the Stark, or the effort in finding him, knowing he was close to both the billionaire, as well as Ms. Potts.

He smiled at those people who came up to him and asked, telling them he didn't know any more than they did.

Remus, Dora, and even Andromeda, asked him in the privacy of his own home, and he told them he knew the other man was still alive, even if he didn't know any more, and that Lady Death had told him he would come back a changed man. Something which scared him if the change was too much for the man to handle.

They might be chosen by a primordial being, that didn't take away that things they experience could still ruin them. Harry knew all too well that he had PTSD from the war and expected Tony to have the same after everything that would be happening in Afghanistan.

Another month passed, making it 3 months since Tony had been kidnapped, and the more they waited, the more they noticed the way Stane was handling things.

The older man was sucking up to several higher up at the Armed Forces, assuring them he would keep supplying weapons to them, even if neither Pepper nor Harry believed that this was the only reason.

They had seen the bank statements, and Pepper had gone snooping around, finding statements of deals with undesirables, or even known terrorist groups. Meaning they at least had enough evidence to put Stane on trial for selling to the highest builder, and to buyers outside of the contract SI had with the Army.

Now all they needed was for Tony to turn up again, and to take his place as CEO once more. They could brief him as soon as he was back on American soil, about what they had found and have the man look for himself to see if he could unearth anymore shady schemes.

Luck was on their side however, when Rhodey called to say he had been in Afghanistan, and had found Tony, wandering through the desert.

Both Harry and Pepper held their hearts, glad to know their friend was alright and would be coming back home as soon as doctor checked him out at the army base they were relocated too, before they got flown back home.

Meeting Tony on the army airstrip had been a whole affair, Harry had been invited by Pepper, and despite them trying to keep it under wraps, the press was there to look out for the wounded genius.

Pepper pursed her lips as they arrived at the airstrip, the multiply journalists standing there, hoping to get a shot at seeing Tony Stark all beat up had her angry, and feeling like someone must have told them where he would get off.

Sighing, she got out of the car and approached the airplane that just had landed, relieved to see Tony get out of it, on his own two feet. He looked at her and made a joke about the tears in her eyes.

As soon as they were in the car, Tony let go of the bravery he held on to, laying his head on the shoulder closest to him, which was Harry's.

Harry's eyes were drawn to the light seeming to come from Tony's chest, before the words Lady Death had said came to mind, ""He'll come back a changed man.""

Sighing, Harry didn't want to start this conversation now, they would have time for that. He wanted to be here for Tony right now. Happy drove them to the Malibu mansion where they all gathered in the living room, letting Tony lead the conversation as well as tell what he wanted to say.

""I saw a lot of SI weapons standing there, in the terrorist strong hold I was kept in.""

Pepper and Harry looked at each other, before sighing, ""we figured.""

Tony concentrated on him, ""you know something, more than just this.""

Both of them nodded, Rhodey who had come inside from the kitchen and Happy shuffled closer.

Pepper started telling what they had found, and who seemed to be at the helm of those practices.

Tony sighed, rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands, ""I guessed something like that, even if I didn't want to believe it.""

Telling them of that one time he had been dragged in front of a camera, he had recognized his own name, as well as Obie's name. He had remembered as much as he could, which was a lot, to ask his fellow prisoner to translate.

Tony sighed, ""it seemed that Obie paid them to kill me, so he could take over SI again and continue his back deals. I... I should have listened to you, Harry.""

The brit shook his head, ""this was not something I wanted to be right about, Tony, not when this is your godfather.""

Tony sighed again, ""do we have proof?""

Pepper and Harry nodded, ""and we already contacted a government agency who deal with this, they will go and puzzle everything together, before arresting Stane on account of treason.""

Pepper added, ""the only thing I hate to be asking of you after all this, is that you need to go to the office as soon as possible. Stane has been whispering the right ears that he'll keep up the weapons contract, even if you told him you wanted to stop doing that.""

Tony grimaced, ""I guess that's a sacrifice I have to make, but as soon as that's done, I'm taking a weeklong break.""

Pepper nodded, ""of course, mister Stark.""

Tony grinned, ""than we should start planning, because I believe a lot has happens since I got kidnapped.""

All of them nodded, and started planning on what they could do, after all the kidnapping of a CEO did have an impact on the stocks SI had. Harry followed their rate and was glad to know they started climbing the moment people knew Tony was back on American soil.

""I think the most important things are to stop the contracts you don't want to have anymore, but maybe you can still keep the army as your allies with providing protective gear?""

Rhodey hummed at that but nodded at the idea. He and Harry had finally met at the airport, with Tony introducing them to each other, the moment they entered the Malibu mansion. Both had noticed why Tony liked the other man, friends were hard to come by for the genius.

After their planning, Tony stayed quiet for a long while, before confessing to how he had gotten out of that cage, and how he wanted to keep doing that - not getting kidnapped, but experimenting with the armour, and going after groups that had his weapons, destroying them so they wouldn't be used to harm US troops.

Rhodey was the only one opposed, mostly because of army protocols, but he agreed that the bureaucracy of getting permission to destroy those weapons would take too long.

Pepper and Harry just agreed that if this is what he wanted to do, he should do so, they will help, Harry especially with Magic proof technology. Seeing as they had a very wild sort of internal magic in the Middle East.

With those plans laid out, they relaxed the rest of the day. There would be changes and soon, starting with the rejection of the next weapon's contract with the military.

They had gotten word from Agent Colson that they had everything they needed to arrest Stane the following day, seeing as tonight was a gala for the Maria Stark Foundation, where oddly Tony hadn't gotten an invite for.

Calling Pepper, the redhead let him know he most certainly had an invite, but that someone must have made sure he didn't get it, further fanning the rumours that he was being put on probation as CEO after the board had voted and given him 'leave'.

Scowling for a moment, before fishing his phone out of his pocket to dial one of his best friends, who picked up after the second ring.

""Yeah, Tony?""

Tony grinned, ""how would you feel to crash a party?""

Harry hummed on the other side of the phone, ""what kind of party?""

""There is a Maria Stark Foundation Gala starting in 30 minutes for which I didn't get an invite, kind of odd, seeing as I am the founder. But that aside, Pepper should be there, and I would love to look O -Stane in the eye, only to see him get arrested tomorrow.""

Harry hummed again, ""sure, but you're picking me up.""

Tony laughed, ""it would be my pleasure, I'll be there in 20 minutes.""

As Harry put the phone down, he could only smile, happy that Tony had called him for this. He was starting to get attached to the man, even more attracted as the days went by, and he always had fun when the two of them were together.

Remus, who was sitting next to him, had to hide a grin, ""well, cub, you certainly have a crush.""

Hushing his godfather, Harry got up and ran to his bedroom to change. Dora, Teddy, Andy, and Remus had come over as it was a Sunday, to spend some time together over the weekend. But none of them minded, well Teddy did a little bit, that he ditched them for a fun evening with friends.

After all, Harry had never had the opportunity to be a teenager before, so for him to try and catch up now, made them all so happy for him. Coming to America had been good for them, but also for Harry, especially for Harry.

So, seeing him happy and finally putting his own happiness at the forefront only made them like Tony Stark more, the man had after all been a friend to their godson/cousin, and had helped him adapt both to living in America, but also to being CEO of a major company.

When Harry came out of his bedroom, he was dressed up to the nines in a dark green suit, white shirt, and an emerald green tie. His hair had been brushed back from his forehead and gathered at the nape of his neck with some gel (or a spell).

Looking up, he saw his family looking at him, making him look a bit self-conscious.

""What, wrong choice in clothing?""

Andy shook her head, ""just right, it brings us joy to see you so happy, Harry, and invested in fun times with your friends. Have a great evening!""

Nodding, Harry made his way out the door, as Tony had texted him, he'd arrived. Rolling his eyes at the bright silver Audi the man was driving, with of course the custom licence plate shouting out it was Tony stark driving.

Opening the door, he got a seat and was met with Tony also all suited up.

""You ready?""

Laughing, but nodding, Harry fastened his seatbelt as Tony took of towards the Gala, hoping to wow people attending with Tony arriving, with another CEO as his 'date'. Not that it was an actual date, but still, it helped to shock the media now and again. Especially after most got scared for publishing anything about the CEO of MI, with the lawsuits his legal team had laid at the gossip rags for slander.

Laughing as the valet took the car to be parked, Harry and Tony walked up the stairs to where the gala would be taken place, more than one reporter taking pictured of them as they walked past, more than likely already contemplating what this meant, for them to arrive together.

Seeing Stane up ahead, Harry made sure to steer Tony clear of the man, they could go out and have some fun, before the man ruined it for them.

Entering the ballroom, all eyes were directed to them, Tony directing to where Pepper was smiling and waiting for them.

""I see you both made it.""

Tony grinned, ""of course we did. That is one stunning dress.""

Pepper laughed, ""I'm glad you like it, you picked it out for my birthday.""

Harry had to laugh, Tony was notorious to forget birthdays, so he had just told Pepper, Rhodey and Happy to bile his credit card when this happened, so they got themselves a present on his dime. It might not be all that normal, but it worked for them.

He hadn't offered it to Harry, but this was just because the younger man hadn't had his birthday yet.

Harry just gave Pepper a kiss on her cheek, before telling her, ""I am so glad I convinced you to take that dress when we went shopping, you look stunning.""

Tony looked between the two of them, ""do you go shopping often?""

Pepper giggled, ""quite a lot, yes, after all we do have 5 years to make up for. And it helps that he is just as rich as you, and just as generous to his friends.""

Tony fake gasped, and pressed a hand to his chest, ""Ms. Potts, are you telling me you're only friends with rich CEO's for the money benefits?""

As soon as he spoke, all three started laughing, knowing of course Pepper didn't work like that, not to forget she made more than enough to spoil herself now and again. But then again, the press had fished after such a reason being the reason for her becoming PA so soon after being hired by SI. All of their favourite past time was setting the press on the wrong path.

They had been having fun for about an hour, when Stane noticed Tony had shown up and came to talk to him. All three of them made sure to keep it at small talk, fake smiles and giving the impression they had no idea that Stane was the person who had Tony kidnapped, almost killed, and who wanted to keep SI for himself. Not to forget backdoor deals, shady business, and ties to organisations like Hydra.

When the man finally left, they were approached by a blond woman, who Pepper introduced as Christine Everheart, a journalist who did more serious articles, and their go to journalist for any information they wanted released, or if they had a story they wanted to publish.

Pepper had told them she had invited Christine as her extra, so she had an in for this gala, and for a way for them to be able to talk about what was going to happen tomorrow without Stane overhearing, or for them to be seen in a normal situation and not bring attention to what they were talking about.

Pepper had already told her to be at Stark Industries tomorrow, as she'd get quite the story out of it then. They all knew they shouldn't give information to the press when an investigation was still ongoing, but with this, they just couldn't let it be swept under the rug. And they knew the American people would feel the same way about it - so even if some corrupt judge would release Stane, the people would know, as would the board, making SI, and Tony, just that bit safer.

After enjoying themselves at the Gala a little but more, everyone of them went home, looking forward to tomorrow.

That morning started as any other, Pepper came in to get Tony, and make sure he was ready, for a day at the office. Both of them were dressed to the nines.

Arriving at SI, driven there by Happy, both of them entered and made their way to the board room, entering it without a care in the world. Even if Stane was giving a presentation on the new weapons deal he planned to accept for the American forces.

With a forced smile on his face he welcomes both of them into the room, not even suggesting they leave, or asking what they were doing there. He might have been able to get Tony a vote of no confidence from the board, setting him on hold as CEO. But Howard Stark had always held a 52% share in the stocks of SI, which were inherited by Tony, when Howard came to die.

So, even if Tony wasn't CEO anymore, he still was the owner, and major shareholder of SI, no matter what had been done to his position as CEO, only his death could prevent him from going anywhere in SI, as well as sitting in on every meeting held.

And Stane knew this, kept looking at Tony and Pepper, and grinding his teeth, knowing there was nothing he could say at this moment to make them leave. No one, especially him, could do anything to stop both of them from sitting there and listening to plans that would land in the garbage as soon as the day was over.

Tony, and Pepper, made sure to keep an extra eye on the board, to see who of them were so far into Stane's pocket, they most likely also profited from his back door deals, and whose names they should give to Agent Coulson after he came to arrest Stane.

They didn't have to wait long now, both of them got a text from Happy, telling them Christine and Agent Coulson had arrived, the later with a platoon of backup.

Texting their confirmation back, they just sat back and waited, trusting Happy to lead the correct people, to the correct places.

Before the meeting could end, a knock sounded on the door, it opened to let Happy in, a tight smile on his face as he looked at Stane.

""Mr. Stane, these people here are looking for you.""

Coulson took a step forward, standing next to Happy, a cold look on the man's face, quite odd, seeing as sounded friendly and open that one time Pepper spoke to him on the phone.

""Mr. Stane, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can, and will, be used against you in the court of law.""

With that he mentioned some of his men forward, two who went and retrained the former CEO, before taking him away before he could react. Turning to Tony and Pepper, both of them pointed out the others they thought could be in on the deals, all of which were also taken in for questioning.

Stane was already proven guilty by the evidence they had, but as the law dictated, he would get a chance to defend himself. Even if all of them knew it wouldn't matter much, the army, the president, and most likely the press had already been informed and would release statements which would kill Stane's career worldwide.

As soon as Coulson and his men left, the Agent nodding to Happy, Tony and Pepper, the latter two took to the front of the meeting room.

""This is your one and only chance to confess if you had any knowledge of this. If you had I will try and arrange a deal for you, have you not come clean and will evidence pointing your direction, I will destroy you.""

After he said this, Tony took a seat, not having to wait long, before all 4 remaining board members confessed to having known. Coulson who was waiting at the door opened it again and took those four with him as well.

Running a hand through his hair, Tony groaned, ""now I can't take a weeklong holiday, as I need people for my board of directors.""

Pepper just giggled, ""I already called around, Remus, Charles, Reed, Stephen and I are happy to step in until replacements can be found. None of us will go along with whatever you are saying just because it is you saying it. And we'll know for sure we'll have a team that is competent, willing, and whom we both trust.""

Tony heaved a sigh of relief.

""What every would I do without you, Ms. Potts.""

Pepper giggled again, ""the same thing Harry would do, be miserable and not know what to do with yourselves.""

Tony grinned, before he nodded, ""sounds about right.""

With Stane arrested, and the press going crazy over the story how this all could have happened while they were the biggest contractor with the military. As well as this being the reason so many men and women lost their lives while overseas.

Some other reporters or even bloggers, started digging, and with a little help from Tony and Pepper letting the right people know what it was that they had found it, the whole world knew what Stane had done, who he had dealt with and how he had put a hit out on his own godson.

So matter what he tried to say in court, Tony and Pepper knew that he would still get his just deserves, exactly their intention, they wanted to be able Stane was put out of play, between names and dealings of his customers being found online, as well as the army and the US government who wanted to have him incarnated for treason.

In the end the whole Stane thing was world news on day, and almost forgotten the next day, when word got out that he had been murdered in his cell before the trial could take place. The things they found on the scene pointing in the direction of a terrorist organisation being able to get in and be able to take him out before he could give up names of other people who dealt under the table.

While it stung that Stane would never get tried for the things he had done, Tony had it difficult the most, that this was how his godfather had to end. Having gone against anything and everything SI once stood for. To protect their American forces, to know that the head of such a large company had been dealing with their enemies stung with more people.

The same generals who had been nodding to Stane's ideas not 2 weeks back, had already approached SI with their doubts about continuing their contracts with SI, even if they delivered the best weapons on the market.

Tony had nodded, and told them he understood, that he didn't want to be making weapons anymore after what he had seen in Afghanistan. Leading to them parting on still friendly terms, and with a contract with SI for protective gear, and for their wounded soldiers to be able to get a prosthetic fitted by SI, once they ironed the kinks out of the design they had on the table right now.

Veterans who were willing could even apply as testing subjects to make the process run smoother.

With all that over, Tony could enjoy the last few days of his week long vacation, he started it the moment they were sure no one would forget what Stane had done, and whom was lost because of what he had wanted to do.

He planned on getting back after that, and slowly transitioning the company from largely weapons to a more technical aligned company, concentration of new phones, computers, tablets, and Bluetooth appliance. Together with more medical material, together with MI, he knew SI would survive this and he would become even greater than his father thought it would be.

Without the contracts for supplying weapons to the American government, he was free to expand worldwide, and make SI grow even more than he already had done.

With Pepper on one side, and Harry, with MI on the other, they could accomplish amazing feats and start preparing for a united Earth, on one part, and for the inevitable invasion that would come sometime in the future.

With Stane taken care of, Tony could also concentrate on his own little project, he had told Pepper, Happy, Harry and Rhodey about the armour he wanted to create and use, in first instance, to track down the organisations Stane had sold too, as well as make sure they got destroyed and couldn't be used on innocent civilians, or other military troops.

The making of the suit went easily, with the blue prints still in his head from his time in the cave, only this time he had JARVIS, much more sophisticated materials and tools, and no pressure in fear of getting killed by the people standing outside the door.

With the first one finished, he made sure to start easy, he knew in another situation, he would run before he could walk and try to fly the suit the moment it came out of production. But for some reason, he didn't, not this time.

He took his time and made sure to be able to keep up with all the problems that showed themselves, starting with stabilizing himself, and ending with the icing he got as he made too much altitude.

In the end, it took him a week, to finish the design, and to paint it in red and gold colours, after all subtility was never his style. They might keep it under wraps now, but the pilot of the suit would need to be made public at one point.

His first self-appointed mission was to Gulmira, as a way to liberate the hometown of the doctor who had saved his life in that cave. Whose sacrifice gave him time to escape, and to pick up his life again - cutting out the snake in the grass of SI, who made it possible for this terrorist to be such a terror to these villagers.

While he was flying halfway around the world, Harry, Happy and Pepper were in the mansion, following through the feed of what Tony was seeing, as well as commentary from both Tony and JARVIS.

On the way back to Malibu, Pepper made sure to text Rhodey to let him know that the radar might be able to pick up Tony when he flew over, to make sure no one started firing, or the army base thought a missile was on its way. As usual, the excuse of a training exercise was used, for new not to be confirmed weaponry.

With that out of its way, all of them were happy Tony made it back home without any trouble.

The days, weeks and months after, Tony kept on doing missions to destroy the SI weapons in the hands of anyone who had gotten them through Stane, with the news coming to light that someone, or something was destroying these weapons, the opinion were divided.

Some people believed this person, or this 'Iron Man' was doing the right thing and making sure these weapons wouldn't be in the hands of groups that would misuse them.

While others believe that it might be extra-terrestrial wanting to strike on every weapon wielding group, or organisation. Which of course send the conspiracy theorists in a frenzy in an effort to prove this was either an alien, or a person hired by the government to clean up their messes.

A whole different group of people, mostly enhanced, had the idea that Stark himself was behind it, having hired someone to clean up the mess Stane had made. But none of them were of the opinion the pilot of the suit was the billionaire himself.

Pepper, Rhodey and Harry made sure to keep an ear on the ground to make sure not too out there rumours were being told. No one suspected Tony to pilot the suit, even if some people were close in believing this was SI cleaning up messes.

While this was going on, Tony and Pepper were also rebuilding SI from the ground up, in a manner of speaking. With the weapons department closed, they made sure to relocate all those employees, so none had to be let go.

Presenting their future project in select groups, and asking team leaders or managers to keep everyone up to date, and to press upon everyone that there would be no people fired, they had a solid plan to work off and explant already existing departments.

This was a huge relief for some of the people working in those departments, as it meant more funding, more projects, and hopefully with time, the possibility to work on their own project with support from SI, or from MI, it had become an open secret on the floor of SI that the two companies would have a semi-merger, to give MI some more name in the circles it lacked that in.

And for SI to get a boost in developing their new departments, as well as some help in their future projects. They planned on setting or re-entering the business world with a whole new way of working, largely based on the cooperation between the two companies.

Both Tony and Harry looked forward to working together like this, after meeting and getting to be friends, and getting along amazingly well. As well as the unresolved sexual tension neither of them wanted to acknowledge just yet, they knew this would turn into something magnificent, and something that would help the world in more than one way.

Add to that, that both companies had a great image with enhanced communities, it only helped them to prepare for what Lady Death had told them, as vague as she was, it never hurt to be aware of the communities they had on their side and who they could call upon, if the time should come.

About 3 months after Tony had returned from captivity, and 3 months after the normal launch of their merged project, Tony and Harry had a combined press conference where they would let the world know what they were planning, and what the future for SI would look like.

This started with introducing the 'new' companies as they were, before switching to let their audience know what they hoped to accompany together.

Tony grinned as he explained, ""my captivity gave me the insight that I needed, but already had on my mind for some time. That I didn't want to make my legacy with weapons alone, not after the war and terror that already haunt the world.

Harry and I got talking after we got introduced by Pepper Potts, my secretary, and Harry's best friend, about where we wanted to take out companies, and found out goals to align. We want to help the enhanced community, as a minority, to find employment more easily. This because we both have people; we are close to that fall into that category.

Next, we want to leave a legacy that people will look back to, in let's say a couple hundredth years, and remember the things we did for the world and its inhabitants as a whole, medical, social, and financial.

So, without further a due, we are proud to announce, a partial merger between SI and MI, which will mostly go about electronics, as well as a line of prosthetics and other tools to help those with a disability. More project will be soon to follow, but these are the ones we are starting with.

Thank you for your attention, we will now be taking questions.""

Taking a seat next to Harry, with Remus on the other side of Harry, and a newly instated Pepper as CFO on the other side, they answered the questions asked to them by their audience of reporters.

Most of the questions, luckily, stayed on the matter of the merging, and future projects. Some were more personal, but left unanswered, as they tried to find out who the enhanced were in their bubble. One reporter made it look like Tony was leading Harry by his nose into a failed merger, but he was soon disproven by Harry and Remus, and wisely shut up.

Christine was the only one who got a non-merger question asked, if only because they had asked her to ask, as the press conference came to an end, Christine stood to ask her question, a grin on her face, as she gave a nice introduction to her question before turning to Tony, and asking; ""So, Mister Stark any comments on the matter of the 'Iron man'?""

Tony looked at her, before glancing at Harry and Pepper, and smirking, ""the truth is, I am Iron Man.""

I wanted to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays to those of you who don't celebrate!Have this little gift from me, an extra chapter outside the usual posting days!

After that press conference, and the reaction this caused, he could say he didn't mind having an evening where they went out to eat, just him, Pepper, Happy and Harry. After all, they had managed to clean up after Stane, most of his dealings had been destroyed, and the safety of people in those areas once again free, instead of living in fear about the terrorist on their doorstep.

He had never forgotten what the apparent leader of the Ten Rings had told him, that the person holding Stark Weapons was the biggest player on the field.

He wanted to take that advantage from people who hadn't used his weapons fer the betterment of people, or a country. Most of the shipments he had found, or even intercepted, had been on route to known terrorist groups, who wouldn't be doing this to help their people.

He shook his head and enjoyed the evening out with his friends. Looking at the other dark haired man seated next to him, he was happy to have found this man, even without the bound they had with Lady Death.

Ever since he had met the other men, he had felt lighter, that he mattered, that there were people who wouldn't be fooled by the things they had heard from the media, who gave the benefit of the doubt. Even without knowing that he was a favoured of a primordial being, it helped him keep perspective.

Even now, he knew he needed to start doing something to exchange the palladium core in his arc reactor, and before he might just try to do this on his own. But right now, he knew he needed help, with Harry being the person he trusted to help with this.

As they got out of the restaurant, he asked the Brit if he could come to his place for a bit, that he needed help with something.

Harry looked at him a little funny, which made him smile, Tony Stark was indeed not the person without a plan, or who needed a lot of help. But he nodded, saying their goodbyes to Pepper and Happy, who took the company car to Pepper's apartment.

Harry, meanwhile, led Tony to his car and drove towards the Black mansion, to talk over what he needed help with.

--

Once inside the mansion, Tony looked up to his phone, getting a notification that JARVIS was shut off from his own house. Frowning, he had half a mind to just up and check it out. But Harry made him wait, after all, this person most likely wanted a direct shot at Tony, but he was at the Black mansion, and as such safe at this moment.

Tony sighed, but nodded, Harry had a point, after all JARVIS had his server in SI's mainframe that existed, he would be fine even if he were shut down for a moment. He was safe at his friend's house, where no one could just enter because of the wards.

Harry tilted his head at him, ""what is it you need help with?""

Tony buttoned down the shirt he was wearing, showing Harry his chest, which had dark lines showing coming from the arc reactor.

""It's poisoning you.""

Tony nodded, ""I know this is different for us, but I still want to find a solution for this. So, do you think you can help me?""

Before Harry could answer, a cold swept through the room, making them both look up at the figure now standing behind them.

""Lady Death.""

""My Merchant, My Master. This I can help with.""

Both of them hummed and looked at her.

""My Merchant, your father figured out a new element to use in the arc reactor. You would need his model of the Stark Expo from 1974, he hid in there for you to find later.""

Tony blinked a few times, ""in the Stark expo model?""

Lady Death nodded, ""at the time he discovered it, there were no methods to make it, or to synthesise it. You can, and you should, as soon as possible.""

Harry narrowed his eyes at Lady Death, ""something is coming?""

Lady Death nodded, ""it is nothing you cannot handle, but it would be better if My Merchant is not suffering from heavy metal poisoning. Also, the person in your home, My Merchant, does not mean any harm.""

Harry and Tony looked at each other, nodding, before taking the car to Tony's home. Once inside, they did find JARVIS on non-active. They rebooted him first, before making their way to the living room, where a person was waiting for them.

""That is quite the announcement, Mr. Stark.""

Tony narrowed his eyes at the man, while Harry had recognized him as someone Kingsley had told him about. While Tony was still processing, Harry spoke.

""Nick Fury, or is it still Nickolas Shackbolt?""

The man looked at Harry, shocked, ""so, Kinglsey wasn't lying when he said you had moved to the America.""

Harry scoffed, ""as if you didn't know. I know you're the director of SHIELD, and what spy organisation doesn't know every person that comes in and out of the country. Especially one such as me.""

Nick grimaced, ""that was flawed on my part.""

Tony answered, ""just a bit. Why are you here.""

To both their astonishment, he pitched his superhero team to them, where he wanted Earth to have an extra defence force for when they were invaded again. Tony and Harry looked at each other, before looking at Fury.

""Send us both the details, and we'll consider it. Can't promise a full-time time commitment, though, as we both have our companies to consider.""

Fury nodded, ""that's all I ask. Even as consultant both of you could help us more than of the others.""

Tony tilted his eyebrow, ""the others?""

Fury nodded, ""I'll send you a list of people being considered to be on the Avenger initiative.""

Tony frowned, but nodded as Fury walked past him.

""One last thing, next time just come through the front door, and stay away from my AI.""

Fury nodded, giving a salute before leaving.

After Fury had left, Harry filled in Tony on what he knew on the one-eyed spy. He was the head of the organisation called SHIELD, which was the same organisation Coulson was part of, they dealt with threats on a global scale, or extra-terrestrial ones. They had been founded by Howard Stark and Margaret Carter, after Word War II, back then to deal with the threat that had been a left over of Hydra. As well as to look for Captain America.

Harry shrugged as he said, ""Kingsley said he had family in the organisation, Nick has been in it for a long time, and probably also knew your father. But anyway, they operate in the shadows, and with us accepting to look into the Avenger Initiative, they won't send someone in to spy on you.""

Tony hefted an eyebrow, ""why would they spy on me?""

Harry looked at his friend, ""Tony, seriously, you're a civilian who designed a suit that could act like a one man army. Of course, they'd be watching you, if only to be on scene the moment you turned to a darker path. I know you won't, but they won't. They just see a billionaire, who until a few weeks ago was known for being the best weapon maker in the world, only for you to make an armour decked out in more weapons than the standard tanks.""

Tony hummed, ""you have a point there.""

Harry continued, ""with you letting the world know you made the suit, be prepared to get asked from all sides if it's for sale.""

Tone scowled, ""I won't sell it, but I do plan on making one for Rhodey, and maybe Pepper, if she wants to, so I can at least placate the military.""

Harry nodded, ""that would be a strategic move, even if it's just Rhodey, he is an airman, which will get the army as a whole off your back. I would add in a clause that all upgrades, maintenance and other things pertaining Rhodey's suit have to go through you.""

Tony grinned, ""way ahead of you, sweet cheeks, I already drafted the contract and had Pepper check it, I plan on letting Rhodey read it over as soon as I get a hold of them.""

Harry blushed at the name Tony gave him but found that he didn't mind. They had been growing closer over the months, even more so after the reveal from Lady Death, and Tony's return from Afghanistan. He would see where this goes, he was happy with the pace it took.

He nodded, ""I just heard that Hammer got signed on as the new supplier for arms to the military, and I know you wouldn't want him to get his fingers on your stuff.""

Tony pulled a face, ""after everything that happened at the gala, he still got a weapon's deal with the military.""

Harry nodded, ""he claims to have a way to build suits like yours, just more of the drone kind, as to be able to send those to war zones, instead of people, and risking losing lives.""

Ton frowned, ""that sounds fishy, as far as I know I'm the only one capable of making something similar to the Iron Man armour.""

Harry nodded, ""I know, and I'm sure I can get a few people to look into it, I just wanted to let you know. As we both dislike Hammer, and don't want him to get away with adjusting Rhodey's armour or using your designs in this plan of him.""

Tone scoffed, ""that's an understatements, we both hate him after that one gala, where he implied you were a hooker. Not to mention the constant measuring thing he has going on with me.""

Harry snorted, ""maybe he's just feeling insecure, and wants to measure himself to the greatest on the market, not that he gets even close, but you know, he can try.""

Tony grinned, ""you think I'm the greatest?""

Harry nodded, suddenly shy, ""I think you're amazing, and very smart and sweet, and nothing at al like the media depicts you. You can be a bit arrogant, but you deserve to be, with the things you have accomplished, and the things you want to accomplish. I... I am very happy to have met you, Tony.""

Tony just grinned, wrapping his arms around the other man's waist, ""so, where does this leave us?""

Harry hummed as he rested his head against Tony's, ""I don't know, I like the way we're gravitating towards one another, and I like this pace we have going on. I want to keep going at that and see where we find ourselves.""

Tony grinned, and tightened his arms around Harry, ""does this mean I can kiss you?""

Harry smiled, ""yes, it does.""

They gravitated towards each other, their first meeting nothing more than just a press of their lips, but it felt like so much more. Even with such a short meeting, both of them could feel the whole sparks and fireworks routine happening.

As they parted, they looked at each other, with smiles on their lips, and stars in their eyes.

""I'm going to do that again.""

As he said it, Tony pressed close again, his lips finding Harry's again, pressing against them much longer, although he kept it to that. He respected Harry's wish to take it slow. He might have had experience, but he didn't think Harry had a lot of that. And he cared to much about to Brit to even try and scare him away.

Not after he was feeling so comfortable with him, like he always had seen Edwin and Ana Jarvis be, separate persons, but also extensions of their partner. That's what he wanted, and was quite sure, he could have with Harry, so a slower pace it was.

They exchanged several kisses, before both went their own ways, Tony to tinker on some new schematics for the Iron Man Armor - and to see what he could dig up from the '74 expo. Harry to go home and sleep, he would have a busy day at the office tomorrow, with hiring new people now that MI was expanding their departments because the merger with SI was such a success.

Normally Tonks would handle the hiring process, but Teddy had gotten ill, so she was staying at home. He's told her he'd take over and do the first interviews with prospecting employees.

Tony had gotten a hold of Rhodey and asked the man to come by his house. He had something for his best friend, which would also please the Higher ups in the Military.

Intrigued, the other man had given this message to the brass and was allowed to take leave to go and visit his best friend, curious, as were his superiors, as to what the genius would give him that would also please the higher ups.

He had an idea, but quickly dismissed it, there was no way that Tony would just give him a suit.

Once at Tony's Malibu mansion, his best friend sat him down, and put a contract in front of him.

Arching one eyebrow, he looked at the genius, ""What's this?""

Tony just grinned, ""read it first, honeybear.""

Rhodey snorted but took the contract and went through it. He could recognize Tony's way of putting things, with some alterations made no doubt by Pepper. As he got to the end of the multiple page contract, he looked his best friend in the eyes.

""Is this for real?""

Tony nodded, ""I'm done with making weapons, but I also know that if I were to keep this technology for myself only, I'd have a court case within a few months - especially with his effective the suit has been proven.

I don't plan on making multiple copies, maybe one more for Pepper. But anyway, I trust you with a suit, and I know the brass trust you - so me and Harry thought it would be a great idea to give you one of your own.""

Rhodey's eyebrow arched again, a grin on his face, ""me and Harry?""

Tony huffed, but the smile on his face betrayed him, ""yeah, me and Harry. Anyway, Harry told me that Hammer got the contract with the military, so anyway, its why I put in that only I handle maintenance, and upgrades and the like - I don't trust him and neither does Harry, I don't want his hands on my tech.""

Rhodey shrugged, ""I don't see anything wrong with that, I need to get permission from the brass though. Do you mind if I call them?""

Waving a hand, Rhodey called his superiors, JARVIS making sure to put the conversation on the house system, so it was on speaker, and Tony could hear everything that was said, and answer any questions directed to him.

To say that the brass was jumping in their seats, was putting it mildly, they were on cloud 9, to have a suit for their own mission, for as long Rhodey could fly it. They also agreed to all the clauses Tony put in contract and told Rhodey to sign right away.

Ending the call with his superiors, Rhodey took the contract Tony had given him and signed it, Tony taking it after that and signing too. JARVIS made sure to scan it in before Tony gave it to Rhodey for him to file at the military.

Grinning at his best friend, ""want to go and choose the colours? I can get JARVIS to have this painted before you go back to base.""

Like a kid in a candy store, Rhodey followed Tony down to the lab, where his suit, HIS suit, was laid out in all the parts, giving him a chance to also look it over.

Tony might be the genius between the two of them, but he had still graduated MIT with quite the grades, at a normal pace too. So, looking over this piece of technology, was great to see. While he knew why Tony didn't make weapons anymore, the fact that he wanted to owe up to those people that had been hurt, killed, or forced to flee their houses because of this weapons and wanted to clean up after himself told him a lot about his best friend.

He'd already knew Tony was not at all like the media depicted him, but the genius also had a habit of hiding who he really was, in fear of being taken advantage off - as some had done before.

But gifting his best friend a multi-million armoured suit, to placate the military, and probably to be sure he had backup he could trust, was nice anyway you looked at it.

Nodding, Rhodey looked at Tony, ""this looks great Tones, Can I look at the specs too?""

Tony nodded, ""choose a colour scheme first, so JARVIS can start painting.""

Humming, Rhodey asked for a grey and blue colour scheme, kind of like the colours of the US military uniforms. It would also help to camouflage him, contrary to Tony's bright red and gold suit.

Nodding, they decided on the colours and let JARVIS get start painting. While the AI was doing that, Tony pulled up the specifications of Rhodey's suit on one of his hollow tables, letting the other look them over, ask questions, and have requests for the weaponry in and on the suit.

As they sat upstairs in the living room with something to drink, Rhodey turned to Tony.

""That you don't like Hammer, I understand, but what happened that Harry doesn't like the man?""

Tony grinned, before telling the other just what had happened between them at the first gala Harry had gone to. Which also explained how it was that Hammer, despite having a sizable fortune, wasn't invited to high class events anymore. After all, doing something like that to someone who outclassed you several times over, was social suicide.

Rhodey had choked at hearing that, ""he said what to Harry?""

Tony nodded, ""indeed, Pepper put him on his place soon after, and I was once again reminded why she is one of my best friends. Not to forget Harry, and I, we had this instant connection. I kept some distance, just wanting friends to start with. Because you know, that had been known to be a ploy to get something out of me.""

Rhodey grinned, ""but Harry isn't like that.""

Tony shook his head, ""Pepper told me his worth once, and it is almost double of mine, so I don't worry he's out for my money. And us working together, came because we both wanted more - but MI is more focused on the enhanced, while SI makes great leaps in electronics, and hopefully also in other departments with this partial merger.""

Rhodey hummed, ""so it was to further both SI and MI, not because he wanted to ride on your coattails.""

Tony shook his head, ""not at all, he takes this very serious, and puts a lot of time in his projects. He never missed a deadline, and more than not, he comes over with ideas to improve both his own products, as well as mine. I don't think he wanted to take advantage of me in any way.""

Rhodey nodded, ""I already knew that to be honest, Tones, the man really likes you.""

Tony grinned, ""yeah, I figured that out too. The feeling is mutual, by the way. We had a talk about it yesterday.""

Rhodey arched an eyebrow, ""really now?""

Snorting, Tony grinned, ""enough fishing, Platypus, we plan on taking it slow, and let this natural attraction we have led us to wherever we go. Keeping it quiet too, for now, we did kiss a couple of times yesterday though.""

Rhodey grinned, ""I'm happy for you, man, you deserve this. A chance at happy, without keeping watch that the other person is trying to take advantage of that. I wish you both the best.""

Beaming at his best friend, ""Thanks, sugarplum.""

They enjoyed their day together, with Tony helping Rhodey suit up for the first time soon after the paintjob was done. The stars in the airman's face were enough to make Tony smile.

When Rhodey had left, suit flying back to the airbase, with Tony promising to get his car back to him as soon as possible, the genius took a moment to make a mental to-do list.

He needed to get that model of the Stark expo of '74, all the other things could wait for a bit.

If what Lady Death were true, not that he doubted it, the model would hold the secret of a new element his father discovered, and which would, or could, be compatible with the arc reactor and as such solve his heavy metal poisoning problem.

Looking it us, he saw that it was in storage in SI HQ, so he could go and get it the next day, when he went in to have a meeting with Pepper, as his new CFO she was doing a terrific job, taking some things out of his hands, and helping with others, like the well-oiled machine they had been before.

He believed his father might have discovered an element before, but as he had been told, the technology to synthesise this element wouldn't be available, not even to a man like Howard Stark. Once again proving that he, Tony, had taken SI beyond what Howard had wanted, or dreamed it to be.

Even with this element, who knows what steps could be taken to use this is electronics, or in technological advancements, or maybe even medical ones.

He couldn't wait to find out, the moment he rediscovered it, and could synthesise it.

Harry on the other hand, had quite the day so far, with him stepping up to take over Dora's job, while she was at home taking care of a sick Teddy.

He had to give it to his aunt, for the way she had been able to deal with this, before. Part of the applicants didn't turn up or turned up late without any reason.

Others turned up solemnly to see him, and weren't even looking for a job, or too young to be hired, making him sigh once again. He didn't get it; he was a new player on the market - and maybe they wanted to get to know him - but some of these people were approaching stalkerish behaviour.

It took him until the afternoon to filter out all those who hadn't shown up (their resumes were kept in the event they ever applied again, as to ask about it - they didn't need someone on board who didn't show up or didn't have the human decency to let the company they were applying at that they wouldn't be coming), those only coming to this job day to catch a glimpse of him (which didn't help that today of all days was the day he'd take over from Dora), and the last remaining group: the actual candidates.

They needed several new people on board, with the was their production had grown since the announcement they would be working together with Stark Industries.

So far, he had a group of promising college students, who were looking for an internship, but with most of them being enhanced, or closely related to an enhanced, they didn't have that much luck with other companies - while he, and MI, was happy to take them on.

He had told them that and asked them to come back the following week to get a tour, and to get introduced to their supervisor with whom hours had to be arranged. They would even get paid for the internship hours, even if it were in the lower category in terms of pay.

A few promising others, where for desk jobs around the company, he needed an extra hand at the reception, and he wanted at least 2 more accountants working for him. The last job was for his personal assistant.

Four women, and three men had been chosen from the initial applicants and asked to come back for a second interview the following week, when Dora was back, and their future department heads could be present too.

One applicant however, had him sighing, one Natalie Rushman, who he asked to stay for a second interview right that moment. The smile she gave made it look like she was confident she would be getting the job of PA right this moment.

The moment his door closed, however, Harry looked at her with a smirk on his face.

""Did Fury actually think I wouldn't notice an agent trying to sneak in?""

Her face changed, a look of irritation on her face, as she regarded him, ""he said I was welcome to try. I had been expecting someone else here today - not you.""

Harry shrugged, ""Dora would have been able to spot you too, just so you know. Kindly leave.""

Nodding stiffly the woman left, prompting Harry to text Tony and Pepper to let them know that Fury, or someone else in SHIELD was trying to infiltrate. He got texts back that both of them would look into it, and a thank you for the heads up.

Tony also texted that everything had gone well with Rhodey, which made Harry happy for his partner.

Happy New Year everyone! I wish you all the best for 2021.To start off the year amazingly, have a new chapter!

As Tony got the text from Harry he had to snort, Harry would notice a spy, or a SHILD agent, a while away. Not only that, but the only ones they had met - Fury and Coulson - had left a good impression, with this Nathalia Rushman character, Fury had only put them on edge.

They had both agreed to be on stand-by should anything happen that needed enhanced individuals, as part-time forces of course. But now, with an attempt of espionage, Tony didn't really want to take chances and asked JARVIS to start looking up everything he could find pertaining to SHIELD.

Making a note to look at it tomorrow, Tony went to his bedroom, he needed sleep - as he knew, for sure, that figuring out the 'new' element, or rediscovering the element his father had, would take him some time.

Seeing as it impacted his health, however, he wanted that to be done as soon as possible. Most of his on-going project were going well, and those that needed work would be passed by him anyway, either by Pepper, JARVIS or by Harry.

For now, he needed rest, he could feel the heavy metal poisoning going on, even if the more severe effects hadn't started yet, he was glad he had other people looking out for him. If he hadn't, who knows what would have happened. He would be a lot less rational about all this, that's for sure.

Might have even promoted Pepper to CEO, thinking he'd die before the end of the year. Or he'd do something stupid like go to Monaco to drive in a F1 race, or other things like that.

Shaking his head, Tony got ready for bed. After telling the bots and JARVIS goodnight, and texting Harry, he slept, for once since his return from Afghanistan, without any nightmares.

If he had opened his eyes, he would have seen Lady Death standing over him, making sure he had a good night's sleep. After all, her Merchant needed to be in his best shape to change the course of history tomorrow. With him being healthy sooner than would have been in another universe, he also would be able to make use of the new element he synthesised.

As her Merchant slept, she disappeared and appeared in front of her Master.

Harry, having expected Lady Death, looked at her.

""You've been dropping an awful lot of hints recently, any particular reason?""

Lady Death didn't answer right away, but when she did, she said, ""the events that I have warned you about, they are coming closer. I have seen other scenarios of this time play - and feel like these changes I nudge you both to will be very beneficial in the long run.""

Harry blinked a few times, ""I thought you couldn't influence the universes as they were?""

Lady Death nodded, ""I can't, but I can give hints or clues to you, My Master, My Merchant, or My Champion - and influence it all indirectly.""

Harry hummed, ""so you're making use of us Mortals who have your favour to change the course of this universe.""

Lady Death nodded, ""if you hadn't come to America, I fear I would have enclosed my Merchant in my arms a whole lot sooner than I would have wanted.""

This made Harry frown, ""so there are universes that we never met.""

Lady Death nodded, before adding, ""there are those where there is no MI, and no wizarding world connected to this one. You must understand My Master, that for every choice ever made, another was also made in a different universe. It is the art of making all the right ones, that dictates the continuous survival of a universe within the Multiverse.""

""So, you have multiple Masters, Merchants, or Champions?""

Lady Death shook her head, ""I have only one of each, all of whom resident in this universe - per chance. There have been others, before you, who have joined me in the realm outside the Multiverse as my Reapers, but inside the Multiverse, only one of my connected can exist at the same time.

There have been others who might have become a connected, but they made a different choice, or the world around them was shaped differently, leading to them not making the same choice you made, because that wasn't a choice to make to them.""

Harry hummed, ""can I get an example of that?""

Lady Death thought about it for a moment, before nodding, ""there is a universe were you never accepted the title of My Master, and where you in time Married Ginny and had 3 kids with her. In this universe, there is no Tony Stark, or SHIELD, or even enhanced, except the magical community.

In another universe, there is no Magical community, but there is a Tony Stark, who ends up marrying Pepper Potts, and having a daughter - Morgan. He also loses his life, in the battle against the Mad Titan.""

This had Harry cringing, to think that some version of him married someone who looked a little too much like his mother.

Lady Death rested a hand on his shoulder, ""they did have a very different life, to the one you had here, My Master, never forget that you become because of what happened to you. The same thing is happening to them - no universe within the Multiverse is the same.""

Harry nodded, and banished the thoughts he had about this to a far end of his mind, he lived here now, in this universe, as the Master of Death, and with a great partner, or Boyfriend, they hadn't decided on that, who he would support in whatever happened next.

""So, in the coming months, things will happen that will kickstart our introduction to this Mad Titan?""

Lady Death nodded, ""one of his brainwashed minions will arrive on Earth, to conquer it in his name. This must not happen.""

Harry nodded, ""alright, I think that can be prevented. What about SHIELD?""

Lady Death once again waited for a moment before she spoke, ""SHIELD will meet its demise from an inside enemy, but I cannot reveal more at this moment. They are not a priority right now, My Master. What is, however, is making sure My Merchant doesn't get ill, or more ill, by the heavy meatal poisoning already going on in his body. He needs that new element.""

Harry nodded, before he looked over his schedule for the coming weeks and cleared it as much as possible. He also texted Pepper and Remus to let them in on what they were doing, and if possible, to take over, for a little while so he and Tony could concentrate on this new element, and whatever came forth from that.

He got two texts back, from both the CFOs that they would do their best to delay or reschedule any meetings coming up in the next week. After all, both of them, and everyone in the companies wanted their CEOs to be al healthy as could be. Especially after everything that was boing done for them by said companies.

Meanwhile, several people of the MI IT department, were doing their best in cracking Hammer Tech's servers, to get into whatever it was the man was doing. After the public insult heh ad given their boss, none of the MI employees were that big of a fan of him.

So, when one of those had noticed the shipments coming into his company, as well as the big promises he made to government and military alike, they smelt something fishy going on, and set out to discover just what that was.

On the SI side of things, JARVAS was assisting the people from MI in discovering what Hammer was up to, as well as searching anything and everywhere for mentions off SHIELD and what it was, they were doing.

On the other side of the country, Justin Hammer couldn't contain his glee as he was contacted by several of his spies, who told him of someone else able to create an arc reactor, not unlike the one Tony Stark used to power the Iron Man suit.

If he could get his hands on that technology, and make it weaponised, the Army would love him even more than they loved Stark. Even if the man had thrown the army a bone, by giving his best friend James Rhodes a suit of his own.

But now, with his new business partner, Ivan Vanko, he would finally be able to surpass Tony Stark, and Stark Industries, and be the headline for the things he did for the US people. Right now, that title went to the coalition between SI and MI, and their amazing technological advancements.

Grinding his teeth, he never forgot how humiliated he was after meeting this supposed English Lord, he didn't seem to be much, so him working together with Stark, didn't mean anything good for either of their companies, even if he was the only one who saw it that way.

Once his newest projects were finished, and the military signed on for the suits he would deliver them, there was no reason for Stark to even exist anymore - Leaving Black and Potts to also fade into the background.

He almost rubbed his hands at the anticipation of getting the fame and glory he deserved, after he disposed of Vanko of course, he wouldn't need the other man once he got what he wanted. Stark would also have to go, if only for the grievances the arrogant bastard had caused him in the past.

Somewhere else in the facility, Vanko was making almost the same plans, in the way that he was also in this to get back at Stark for the man's father stealing the design of the arc reactor from his father.

Now, while working with this Hammer person, he would have the means, the funds, and the possibility to get revenge on the Stark legacy. Once he had done that, Hammer didn't mean anything anymore - and by the way the man made his things, once Vanko was through with him, he wouldn't even be anyone anymore.

Americans were stupid sometimes, but in this case, it only worked in his advantage, and ha would use it to get what he wanted out of it, the end of Tony Stark.

Across JARVIS' server, as well as the IT department of MI, several files appeared, which they all analyse with precision, if what they had found here was true - it would bring about quite the backlash.

JARVIS, looking over both the search into Hammer Tech, and into SHIELD, would have winced had he been human and capable of wincing. This was disturbing in the truest sense of the word. Sir would have to look through this, together with Mr. Potter, Ms. Potts, and Mr. Lupin, before any other steps could be taken. But steps needed to be taken, and fast at that.

Knowing all he could do now, was to save this information, and already filter through it once, to separate non-interesting information from the interesting parts, he did just that with both searches. SI and MI had a role to play in the future of Earth, that much he knew from the talks Mr. Potter and Sir had, they wouldn't be hindered especially not by an out-of-date terrorist organisation, or a pair of men with different issues pertaining Sir, or Howard Stark.

As all of this was happening, Lady Death looked over Earth and the little changes she had brought upon by doing what she did. Directing her gaze towards Asgard, she had to hide a wince at what she could see playing there. This would always play out the same way, Odin sadly enough not capable of taking any other decisions than he did in all the other universes in the Multiverses.

She hoped, however, that with her Merchant and her Master close by something could be done about the outcome this time around. For all those caught up in this first phase.

Surprise! Bet you weren't expecting that as I usually don't upload on weekends, and unless you read the recent reviews, or you are part of my Discord Channel, you wouldn't know I was planning to. But today is my birthday (yay, 28 as of today - the 3rd of January).Enjoy the reading and let me know what you think of it! :D

The following week, Tony made sure to get everything pertaining the 1974 Stark Expo out of storage and had to admit that watching that footage brought with it some nostalgia, almost enough to make him consider building another expo.

Shaking his head, he put it to the back of his mind, there would come a time when the expo could be revived but it would not be now. The most important part was for him to rediscover the element his father had discovered - so he could synthesise it and put it into his reactor.

Halfway through the day, JARVIS let him know that Harry was entering the building, looking up startled, he saw the Brit standing at the door of his workshop, smiling slightly as Tony looked at him.

Telling JARVIS to open the door, he made a mental note to give Harry his own entrance code, so even in the future his partner, boyfriend, soulmate - could get into the workshop on his own, this was after all something for the long run.

Accepting the kiss on his lips, he smiled as the other man sat down next to him.

""So, what are we working with?""

Tony hummed, ""I got into the clips stored with the model, got all nostalgic and might revive the Stark expo at some point in the future. But for now, I have everything Lady Death hinted at I would need. I just need to crack the puzzle.""

Harry nodded, looking over the model as it lay on the table, tilting his head to the side and squinting his eyes, ""it looks like an atom.""

Tony blinked, before going to stand next to Harry and looking at it the same way he was doing. His mouth opening in a gasp, before he pressed a kiss to Harry's lips.

""Genius! JARVIS, make me a 3D scan of the model, but lose the pathways, threes and greenery, restaurants, and food stands. Keeping only the pavilions and the centre statue.""

As the AI did just that, Harry went further into the workshop to say hello to U, DUM-E and Butterfingers, leaving Tony to do what Tony did best.

""Now, use the centre piece as the nucleus and arrange the pavilions around it.""

As the AI did that, Tony could only smile as he found the secret to the model, and to the arc reactor.

Harry appeared next to him in the next moment, ""did you figure it out?""

Tony nodded, ""thanks to you, babe, thanks for that.""

Harry beamed up at him, before looking at the sphere in Tony's hands, ""that's it?""

Tony nodded, ""this is it, now I just need to synthesise it.""

Harry grinned, ""well aren't you lucky I have a miniature particle accelerator at MI that you're more than welcome to use.""

""You really are the best significant other, ever.""

Harry cocked an eyebrow, ""I hope I am your only significant other, Tony.""

The genius grinned, ""of course, gorgeous, I wouldn't want anyone else, not after everything you do for me.""

Harry grinned, ""as long as you keep saying things like that, you won't hear any complaints from me.""

Tony laughed, ""good! Now, let's get to MI, so I hopefully will have enough time so that this heavy metal poisoning isn't getting any worse.""

Harry nodded, leading Tony to his SUV and driving to the MI HQ, waving at people they passed. Most of the employees at MI, and SI, were used to seeing them together. Making their way to the basement, Harry opened a door at the end of the hallway.

He had been very surprised to find this had been at the basement in HQ, until he found out that this was how they added magic to some particles found in most metals. To use them in the electronics MI produced, to make them resistant to Magic in a way normal electronics weren't.

And it worked, as they introduced the magic gradually to the atoms making up certain materials, they could use those easily when making their enhanced proof technology. With the element Tony would synthesise now, who knew what they could use it for.

Pepper and Remus looked up when they received a notification of an incoming mail. JARVIS, and the MI IT team as the senders.

Both weren't together, but still looked at the mail at the same time, seeing the other had gotten the mail as well. Looking over the information they found, their eyebrows climbed upwards on their foreheads.

Both reached for their phones and called the other in a video call.

Pepper looked at her uncle figure, ""we aren't telling them this, not after we cleaned house first. Not only that but Hammer and Vanko need to be caught first, I don't want either of those men close to Harry, or to Tony.""

Remus nodded, making copies of everything that he had received. Putting them into secure servers they had at Mi, able to withstand even a magical attack.

""Now we just need to think about who we can trust with this information. The files on SHIELD are disturbing, so I don't know if we can trust them to handle this.""

Pepper grimaced, but nodded, she had liked Coulson, but to know what SHIELD had done in the past, and who had managed to slip through the cracks, it scared her a bit. She always saw HYDRA as a mirror of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, only HYDRA wasn't shaped by the childhood they had, but their interest in the mythological, and magical, and the need to weaponize that.

If they had managed to find the magical world in the way they wanted to, after they found out about Grindelwald, the world would be in a lot of problems. The fact that aliens, enhanced and the mythical were slowly introduced into the world never would bode well for them if HYDRA managed to weaponize it.

Frowning the both of them came to an impasse with not knowing what they needed to do, in order to protect their family from both two men willing to destroy the Stark legacy, as well as a group of power hungry psychopaths who wanted to take over the world.

Back in MI, Tony and Harry were gaping at the triangle they had put the new element in, the light it gave out was more of an icy white shine, instead of the electric blue the current arc reactor gave out. Without looking around all that much, they put the new heart of the arc reactor in a protective case and drive it back to Malibu, Tony itching to make a new reactor which could house it, solving his problems with the heavy metal poisoning.

Sitting next to Tony as the genius tinkered with the new element he now had, calculating the best casing he could make for it. Several designs had appeared on paper, with some other calculations he had found around it.

At one point, Harry had taken hold of the new element, finding that the core seemed to be absorbing minimal parts of magic that every wizard excreted.

Gaping, Harry turned to Tony and told the other what he noticed, ""do you know what this means?""

Tony nodded, ""we now have a magic absorbing element, which can be synthesized and looks to be stronger than any other metal on earth, except maybe vibranium.""

""That opens so many possibilities, for SI and MI, but also for the enhanced community.""

Tony nodded, looking up from where he was putting in the data, he needed to have a laser cutter carve out the new casing for his arc reactor, he took a relieved breath.

""I am so happy that I listened to you, and to Lady Death, and didn't become a reckless suicidal wild card, who knows what would have happened then.""

Harry hummed, ""Lady Death parted with some interesting information the last time I saw her.""

As they waited for the laser cuter to be finished, Harry told Tony what Lady Death had told him about the choices made, and the decisions that formed the other universes into the multiverse. When he finished about very different versions of themselves, Tony shuddered, ""I love Pepper, but I don't think I could marry her.""

Harry nodded, ""same, she is like my little sister, I wonder what that version of me saw in her that he was happy with such a life.""

Tony shrugged, ""I guess things played out differently, and as Lady Death said, we didn't exist in each other's universes, so this bond we have here must be to someone else, in their cases Pepper and Ginny.""

Harry bit his lip, but nodded, ""well I for one, am happy I am here with you, in this universe. Together we can handle whatever happens.""

Harry hated that he had said that, after everything that had happened when he jinxed it, this also seemed to be one of those moments.

A few days after they made the new casing for the new arc reactor, he and Tony had enjoyed some time off, when Pepper and Remus had sat the both of them down - showing them what Hammer and Vanko were trying to recreate.

They had both confessed to not wanting to bring this to their attention, until after this was cleared up. But with what JARVIS had dug up about SHIELD, or rather their shadow, they didn't trust the organisation to take care of this without using this as the perfect moment to get to arc reactor technology.

Tony frowned, but understood why Pepper, and Remus, didn't want to come to them with this.

""Call Rhodey, have him look up why Vanko Sr. was deported, and use that as a warrant to fall into Hammer industries. I don't know what they have planned, and even if it would benefit the troops, in the hand of a moron like Hammer, it will do more damage than it will do good.""

Pepper nodded, before calling Rhodey and explaining the situation to him. The army man cursed on the phone, telling them he suspected something going on with Hammer, as he kept promising things that no one believed he would be able to deliver. Now he knew how the man though he would be able to do so.

Finding information on Anton Vanko was easier than he thought it was, texting Tony and Pepper after an hour that the man was deported back to Russia when they found out he was double dealing with the Russians and had made plans of selling the arc reactor technology to Russia, doing so, and making an army with it - to give the Russians an edge in the Cold War.

If the army found out Hammer was working together with a Russian spy, or the son of one, he would be dropped sooner than the moron could try to come up with excuses.

With those files, as well as the aerial pictures he got courtesy of JARVIS, Rhodey went to the higher ups, expressing his concerns in what was happening at Hammer industries. As well as the fact that a man who had already had to almost beg to get this gig, was working with a known Russian spy to even his chances with his competitor, who wasn't even that anymore with the closing of Stark weapon making, he thought it had to be because of some petty reason.

The higher ups of the bras issued a court hearing with Hammer and interrogated him about what they had found.

The man tried to place the blame on Tony, saying the man was trying to cut off his competition. Only for the bras to remind him that SI had stopped manufacturing weapons, so there was no competition on a professional level anymore. This was obviously a personal vendetta, which was not something they wanted to see in their weapons manufacturer.

Hammer was consequently sacked, which made his stocks plummet, and allowed Tony and Harry to buy Hammer industries, keeping the employees working, instead of them having to take the blame for the mistakes Justin Hammer had made.

Vanko, hearing this had raged against Hammer, the two had gotten into a fight - which had blown up part of the factory and killed both of them in the explosion. Many of the people coming over from Hammer industries had thanked Tony and/or Harry for catching them when they were falling. Already letting them know the contracts they had at their companies was leagues better then at HI, making both billionaires shake their heads at the legacy Hammer left behind with his death, al because of his vendetta against them.

Lady Death was watching over her chosen, a sigh leaving her as she saw the God of mischief breaking under the strain the Mad titan put them under. Soon, he would be free - her chosen would make sure of that.

With the new element in Tony's, the man's symptoms vanished, the newly named Starkanium cleaning out all of the damage the palladium had caused.

After that had been done, and with the death of Vanko and Hammer, that was one more worry from their list. The whole HYDRA thing was something they kept an eye out for, but with only files they found while hacking the SHIELD server, none of them saw a reason to start taking counter measures.

For now, they would just keep watching all of this, and act when they found out HYDRA planned on coming back out into the light. SHIELD did do quite a lot of good things, so to put a stop to that, wasn't something they wanted to do.

Pepper and Remus first didn't want to hear about it, wanting to project these two men who were doing such great things for the community, both the mundane, as well as the magical. With this new element too, there will be so many ways they could use it.

Pepper was already calculating the numbers, with Remus telling Dora to start recruiting.

Tony, after meeting Remus and Dora, as Harry's boyfriend this time, had told HR to work with her as well, for all the SI HR department did magnificent work, an enhanced who could change her appearance, to listen to the people coming to 'work' for SI or MI, while thy ewer either send by other companies to spy on them, or they came to see the men leading those companies.

SI's HR had found, as had a lot of other departments, that MI could keep up with them, even if SI had quite a lot more years in the industry, it was refreshing for all of them - with having another company, who worked together to better the world, instead of wanting to steal something of them.

Especially now that SI was getting a building in New York City too.

Tony had pitched the idea to Harry, Dora, and Remus. Telling them that he had grown up in the city and wanted back, but he didn't want to leave all of SI in LA alone. Harry would be taking over that part and would still be going to LA - looking over SI and MI in that state.

Tony meanwhile wanted to open a tower in NYC, where MI and SI could work from, making it easier for Dora and Remus to still do their work instead of shifting to and from LA and NYC.

It also helped that Harry would be living with Tony, the other man had offered. With the apartment in the tower below them for Andy, Dora, Remus, and Teddy - so all of them would live close by again.

Pepper would also be moving, but not to the tower, Happy still had a house in NYC, so they would be moving there, the two of them - much to the joy of their families. The Weasley boys and their partners had even made it across the pond, just to meet the man that made their little sister so very happy.

After they left, Happy had approached all of them and asked if both of them were okay with him asking Pepper to marry him.

Not that he doubted that he would get their blessing, he confessed that he was glad he got it, from all the Weasley men, as well as from Tony and Harry. He planned on asking her just after they moved to New York City, tarting a new chapter in their lives.

Harry had smiled sadly, telling Happy he was sure he was the best thing that had happened to Pepper in a long while, but to also warn the other man that Pepper would always remember his first fiance, Colin, a brave man who lost his live by fighting in what he believed.

Happy had just nodded, and told both of them he knew, while none of them knew, Pepper had made all the right steps in being able to tell Happy all that had happened the UK. It was that happening that made him decide he wanted to marry the redhead, after everything that had happened, she was still such a strong woman.

Which lead them to standing here, in what would be Stark Tower in a few more weeks. Most of construction had been done, the interior decorators were busy with making it all, ready to move into.

Tony was also planning on taking the tower off the grid, he had even built an arc reactor in the basement, with Starkanium at its core, to power it all in a nature friendly way. The only thing he needed to do was take them out of the electric network, which would be done after everything was finished.

Taking a hold of Tony's hand, Harry and he made their way inside of the tower, seeing the floors that would be holding SI and MI workers alike, the SI floors were a blue colour, while MI had red colours. Going up towards their penthouse, Harry smiled as he got out of the elevator.

""Have I thanked you yet for giving me a chance to be here? The manor was getting lonely, and I already spend most of the night close to you anyway. This is a logical step, and I am glad we took it.""

Tony chuckled, ""I also wanted to reunite the family, I know you miss Remus, Dora, Andy, and Teddy every week. This way you won't be missing them so much. With you being the Master of Death, you won't need as much as sleep as a normal human, same with me - meaning you can make it to LA with plenty of time to work from there. Even more so, even if you don't want to - you can take an office here and use that for the day. If any of them need you, they know to call you anyway.

Not only that, but I think everyone at both our companies knows that we're an item. They are just keeping it quiet, to respect our privacy.""

Harry smiled, ""I know, but I think it's cute, that they keep trying to congratulate me on that. Even Carol, I told you about her, right, she called me a week ago to thank me for loaning her the MI attorneys in the court case against her ex-husband. But she also told me she was happy I found love here, and after seeing us together, when he came through the hall of LAX, she saw how happy I was with you.

Even if you're Tony Stark, she kept telling I shouldn't let a man who makes me as happy as you do, go.""

Tony grinned, ""than I am so very happy, I make you happy, sweetheart, I hope to keep doing that - for a very long time to come.""

Harry grinned, ""so, we're staying here for the weekend, right?""

Tony nodded, grinning too, none of their family knowing they had already moved to NYC, the power of magic on their side. Now he just needed to tell his lover the last surprise.

""That's the plan, and with tomorrow being a Friday, I thought we could go to Charles' school and pick up Teddy together with Andy. Or ask Andy if it's alright we pick him up - Dora and Remus should still be at work at that time.""

Grinning even wider, Harry turned around and pressed his lips to the other man's.

""Good plan, then?""

Harry nodded, locking their lips again, pulling away to say, ""the very best, as I came to expect from you, love.""

Tony just grinned, wrapping his arms around the other's waist, ""you ready to explore every part of this penthouse?""

Harry arched an eyebrow, ""why do I get a feeling we won't get much further than the bedroom.""

Tony leered at him, ""because I like exploring you in the bedroom.""

Harry just laughed, but turned and ran to the bedroom, his lover closes on his heels, falling onto the bed in a tangle of limbs, their clothing being pulled off as they kissed heavily. Their coupling after that was just as heated, and full of love.

After, they were laying together in the bed, Harry resting his head on Tony's shoulder, a small smile on his face at being able to have this.

""I love that you get along so well with my family, Tony, I love you, but I don't know if I could do so with anyone not able to get along with Remus, Dora, Andy, and Teddy.""

Tony nodded, before pressing a kiss to the other man's hair, ""yeah, I figured that out very soon. Especially with the way you all treat each other. It's the kind of family I always hoped I would have, but of course my old man didn't know how to give love to his genius son - only thing he wanted to do was look for a super soldier on ice.""

As he said that, a cold spread over the room, looking up, they saw Lady Death standing there. If they felt embarrassed, which they didn't, both Tony and Harry would pull up the blankets, instead both of them let the sheets pool at their waists.

""Lady Death, normally you wait after we were intimate.""

Lady Death nodded, ""normally I would, but I came here to warn the both of you. The first phase of Thanos' plan will start in 2 weeks. He found someone close to this planet that knows how Earth, or Terra, works, breaking his mind so he would lead an assault on it.""

Harry and Tony grimaced, ""so we're dealing with a prisoner of war who will act under coercion?""

Lady Death nodded, happy that her Master and her Merchant picked up on that. As she knew they would, they would look for those signs other would miss, making it so that one of her favourite beings in the multiverse, as well as the parent of a deity which embodied her will on his plane, would be able to be saved - instead of what happened to them in other universes.

""You should pay attention to their eyes, in particular. You'll know what I mean when you see them.""

Harry and Tony nodded, ""thank you for the heads up, My Lady.""

Lade Death nodded, ""this is all I can do for now, but I know you both will make sure everything will go the way it needs to go.""

""We will try out best, to make sure it goes like that.""

Lady Death nodded one last time, before she finished, leaving her chosen to enjoy their evening together.

The next day, about an hour before school let out at Xavier's institute for gifted youngsters, Tony and Harry ware driving to the school with the Brit's SUV. They had called Andy and told her they had already moved and wanted to get teddy from school.

The older woman had agreed, a smile on her face, and had called the school to let them know that Teddy's uncle would come to collect him.

Tony in turn reached out to Charles to let the man know it would be them. After meeting Remus and Dora, the telepath knew Tony and Harry were on the approved people to come and collect Teddy at any time.

The school's headmaster had given his agreement and asked them to step into their office when they were close by. Both of them had agreed.

Walking up the field around the school, some of the older teens were gaping at seeing them on the school grounds. Teddy when he saw them pushed past his classmates to wrap his arms around Harry.

""Uncle Harry, Uncle Tony, you came!""

Tony laughed, as he tousled the boy's hair, ""sure we did, kid, we wanted to surprise you today. And your grandma let us come and pick you up.""

Teddy beamed up at them, taking both their hands as he walked back to Jean, who was smiling at them.

""I hear a congratulations is in order.""

Tony and Harry beamed at her, ""thanks, Jean. Is it alright if we go and see Charles now?""

Jean nodded, mentioning them to go past her. All of them knew that if they didn't find the headmaster's office, Teddy could take them there, or Charles would guide them there. Both of them were looking forward to seeing what Charles wanted from them.

As it appeared, Charles wanted to ask them if either, or both, of them wanted to come to the school at another moment to give something like a business class, as well as to talk to them about letting some of the older kids intern at SI or MI.

Seeing as both their companies already had an internship program, and were opened to accepting teens who were enhanced, this would be a great way for them to gather experience, and maybe even get a job after college. Especially with an internship at MI or SI on their resume, would increase their chances later on in life.

So, without any trouble, Harry and Tony agreed to do that, discussing some days in the near future that would fit one, or both of them.

Charles smiled as they said goodbye, Teddy holding onto Harry's hand as he kept on talking about what had happened at school today. Harry and Tony just smiled, both at the kid between them, as well as each other.

Making their way to the house Remus, Dora and Andy lived in, Teddy ran inside and hugged his grandmother, babbling a mile a minute about school, Harry and Tony picking him up, his friends, the teachers, and the things they would be doing next week.

Andromeda just smiled and entertained the little boy, sneaking glances at her nephew and his boyfriend, she had been so happy to hear that the Black heir had found love. After everything that had happened to him these last years, he was one of the ones most deserving of it.

The fact that his partner was also wealthy, and just wanted Harry for who he was, instead of his money, fame, or status. In fact, Anthony Stark had his own fame in America, had been born to one of the most successful businessmen - and had taken that company to a whole new level.

Seeing them together brought a smile to her face, and warmth in her heart, knowing that the Potters, as well as Sirius would have loved the other man. The man that managed to make their (god)son smile again and enjoy life.

""What are you smiling about, Andy?""

Andromeda shook her head, ""nothing, Harry, just happy to be here close to my family. As well as seeing you laugh again - it has been a while...""

Tony grinned, ""I try to bring him joy every day, I know he deserves it.""

Andy nodded, once again enjoying the way Tony did everything, he could, to make Harry smile, and enjoy life, as well as concentrate on himself instead of trying to carry the whole world on his shoulders.

When Remus and Dora entered, looking slightly tired from the trip back from LA, Harry and Tony grinned at each other, before turning to the married couple.

""So, how would you both like to only have to travel 30 minutes to work, which would still be in the same time zone?""

Dora and Remus blinked a few times, here looking at them, ""the tower is finished?""

Tony nodded, ""we already spend the night there, your apartments are ready too, they just need some more furniture and paint, but I thought we'd be able to get that done this weekend.""

Teddy cheered, he knew that the house they were in wasn't totally theirs, they rented it so he could attend Professor X's school. With his family living once again together in the tower Tony had been building, his parents would be there again when he came home from school and would be able to come and get him from school too.

He knew why they couldn't, or more correctly, knew they would be able to - as Uncle Harry was their boss, but they didn't want to take advantage of that.

Remus and Dora smiled, ""I guess it wouldn't hurt, and I look forward to that. To living together again. It's really finished?""

Tony nodded, ""well, almost, I still need to pull it off the grid, but I wanted to do that this weekend too. Maybe so Teddy can finally see Iron Man take off in front of him.""

Teddy cheered again, after finding out Tony was Iron Man, his uncle's boyfriend was his favourite person on the planet. Other children at the institute didn't believe he actually knew Iron Man, but after today when uncle Tony and Uncle Harry came and picked him up, none of them could doubt that.

Their Saturday was spend going from store to store to make sure everything was brought for the Tower, so they could spend the Sunday decorating, painting and just making it their new home.

With their apartments having taken priority, the business parts from SI and MI wouldn't move in until next week, but that didn't matter. All of them could live here already, with Dora and Remus taking time to get their offices in order, going between LA and NYC for now, to get everything they needed to New York.

When Tony took off them the landing platform on the tower, Teddy looking on and cheering as the American took a lap around the tower before he made his way to the energy supply line in the bay.

Harry put in an earbud and tapped it a few times.

""Test, test.""

Tony's voice came from the other side, ""I can hear you loud and clear, love, I'm going underwater now, I'll hear you when I put her off of the grid.""

Harry hummed, before turning to the tablet he was holding, looking over several things on MI, such as the stock prices, new plans he had gotten on mail, or even just the ratings of their products.

A hum in his ear made him take his attention off of the tablet, ""Are we ready to light her up, babe?""

Another hum, followed by, ""yeah, I took her off the grid, you just need to turn the switch.""

Laughing, Harry opened another app on his tablet, ""are we ready for this, JARVIS?""

The other British voice sounded, ""we are, sir, I ran all the numbers. You are free to turn the switch.""

Humming, Harry turned a button on the app, putting the tower from grid power to power from in built in arc reactor. The light turned off, before it went back on again, JARVIS adjusting the settings, to make sure the light intensity was the same as it was before.

Looking around their living room, Harry spoke into the earpiece, ""how does it look from the outside?""

Tony scoffed, before saying, ""like Christmas, but more... us.""

Harry snorted, before laughing out loud.

""I can imagine, it looks great then?""

Tony hummed, ""it does.""

Harry looked outside the window, seeing the little light that was Tony approaching the Tower. Teddy had already been put to sleep, Remus and Dora retreating to their own apartment, with Andy following to her own apartment linked to the one Remus, Dora, and Teddy were in.

The moment Tony touched down; Harry got a notification from JARVIS that Agent Coulson was on the line for both of them. He could hear Tony telling JARVIS to tell the agent that they were busy right now, to let the man call them back.

Harry had to chuckle as Coulson made an override on JARVIS' systems, which the AI most likely allowed, but still. Hearing Tony enter from the balcony, while telling Coulson to speak to the real-life decoy of Tony Stark.

Looking up when the elevator opened to let Coulson in their apartment, Harry frowned.

""JARVIS, I really hope Coulson did an override, seeing as it's not just us in the tower. No offence to you, Coulson, but we don't know you that well and my godson is running around here too.""

Coulson help up his hands, ""I did an override, and we knew you weren't the only ones in the tower. We checked, but this is very important.""

Harry and Tony looked at each other, before looking at Coulson, ""What can be so important?""

Giving them a tablet, both of them looked it over, seeing very different people on the screen, as well as a blue cube thing - one that seemed to be stolen recently.

""We had a contact with an alien force a few night ago, it killed, or took some of our agents, seemingly without their will. Not only that, but they managed to get into a secure facility, and managed to leave while we were just standing there. The artifact that this identity took is something we would like to receive as soon as possible.""

Harry and Tony looked over everything on the tablet, looking at Coulson as he finished talking, looking back at the tablet again.

Harry sighed, ""I'll go and talk to Remus, can you call Pepper that we both won't be in next week. I think this will take priority now.""

Turning to Coulson he added, ""I take it Fury asked you to come and get us, to help with this?""

Coulson nodded, ""we're counting on the both of you, mostly because we need everyone we have on board.""

Looking at Harry, he added, ""we might also need someone with knowledge of magical, and the mythical. As the entity that attacked us was verified as Loki of Asgard.""

Harry blinked a few times, before looking at Tony, communicating that they needed to talk to Lady Death as soon as possible, especially as she had hinted that something had been happened in Asgard, which was linked to the Mad Titan making his way to Earth.

""I'll just go and let the family know, Tony, can you look over the information we got from Coulson. Come on, Phil, I'll walk you out.""

Phil nodded, ""you know where to reach us, don't you, Stark.""

Tony nodded absentmindedly as the elevator closed, making Coulson turn to Harry.

""We don't know what is going on, but this is something we aren't prepared for. We'll be happy to see you both come by, for whatever way you can help - as I said before, we'll need everyone we can get.""

Harry hummed, ""I take it we won't be the only ones coming to help then, seeing as this is something we didn't expect to happen.""

Coulson nodded, ""yes, we're calling in everyone we can reach, and who are willing to work together with us.""

Harry grimaced, ""yeah, I heard SHIELD doesn't have the best reputation with the enhanced community.""

Coulson nodded, ""yeah, sadly enough, we're happy we have you both as part-time consultants, which will make all our jobs that much easier. We have no idea what is coming from this, the only thing we do know is that it's something new, but not something good.""

Harry sighed, ""We'll have to wait and see, I guess. The best thing we can do is prepare with everything we have and hope for the best.""

Remus and Pepper reacted as both of them knew they would react. They both sighed, before agreeing to take over some of their CEO duties, while they went off to save the world. Both of them had their own brand of saving people thing, which was something they had to live with.

Back into the apartment, they called out to Lady Death, asking her to come and see them.

""I take it, it has begun.""

Looking at the entity as she appeared, her eyes for what they could see appearing to be looking around miserably.

""You have found Loki then.""

Harry nodded, ""we were informed he managed to get into a secure base and get away with some artifacts, as well as some of the SHIELD agents on duty there. I am guessing the Norse God was taken up by the Mad Titan, and persuaded, or even brain washed to come here and do whatever it is they wanted to get done here.""

Lady Death sighed, ""he was brainwashed, you should look at his eyes.""

As this was the second time Lady Death had mentioned Loki's eyes, and them looking at them. Looking at each other, they made it a point to do so - to make sure they made it their own project to look at the Norse God's eyes, and whatever Lady Death wanted to see.

""I wish you luck with what is happening, My Merchant, My Master.""

With both of them going over all the documents Coulson had left behind for them, it was decided they would put JARVIS on going over facial recognitions, to see if they could locate Loki before anything else happened.

With that plan in mind, both of them let other enhanced know that something might be coming, even it they didn't know for sure what it was. It never hurt to have back-up nearby - especially not when this was in essence a scouting mission by the Mad Titan.

When they got a hit about Loki in Germany, where he was seen entering a building hosting a ball with several prominent scientists.

Cursing, Tony pressed a kiss to Harry's lips before putting on his armour and taking off in the direction of Germany - they stayed connected to each other by the same earpiece neither of them had taken off.

While Tony babbled some thing or another into his ear, Harry made sure to look at pictures he could find in which he could find of Loki, the most recent ones taking place not that long ago in New Mexico - where the thing that he noticed was the vivid green eyes.

Comparing them to the pictured from the underground bunker, he could see that the God's eyes were blue - the same blue as the scientist and the SHIELD agents he took with him to wherever he went to.

Cursing, Harry made a note of that, and made a mental note to tell Tony as soon as they reunited. After all the times Lady Death let them know to watch out for Loki's eyes, he and Tony had agreed on doing just that. Making Harry stay behind to look at any archive images they had of Loki.

With what they knew about the Mad Titan and the little hints Lady Death dropped, they knew this moment in time would set the pace for everything that would come after all this.

Before Harry left too, he went by Remus, Dora, Andy, and Teddy, and asked them to go back to the Black manor, just to be sure. Something wasn't feeling right for him, and if both his and Tony's luck held out - chances were great that the invasion Lady Death warned them for would take place in New York.

No way in hell did he want his family to be in the middle of it, he also sends out a message to Professor Xavier, asking the man to contact every enhanced he knew, or could reach, to let them know that something was going to happen and soon.

A lot of enhances lived in, or close to, NYC, and while he would like to keep others out of this, he knew that all of them wouldn't hesitate to protect their city, family, or home - so better to forewarn them of what was to come, instead of not doing so at all and leaving them to their own fates.

Remus and Dora, having been forced to sit out one battle, protested on this, and on letting Harry go alone.

Harry promised he'd be careful, and had Tony promise the same thing through the earpiece, but he also mentioned that Teddy needed his parents, and he would never forgive himself if something happened to Remus and Dora, when he could prevent it from happening.

His uncle, aunt and great-aunt finally agreed, if only to be sure Teddy wouldn't be caught in the crossfire. With the discussion happening, it had taken quite a few hours. The earpiece letting him know that Tony, and some SHIELD personal had managed to get a hold on Loki.

His boyfriend sends over his coordinates, Harry looked at them, and turned on his feet and dissapperating to the coordinates he had been send.

Tony was getting annoyed by the people around him, none of them knew him - but acted as if they did. The SHIELD agent that had been flying the plane in Germany, had fit the description Harry had given him about the person that had tried to infiltrate MI.

She tried to talk to him, no doubt to try and get whatever information SHIELD had been after in trying to get to infiltrate either of their companies. He kept on ignoring her, even if she tried to start a conversation.

The blond in the back kept on glaring at him for doing that, not that he would have expected anything else from perfect Captain America, the man out of time, who probably still believed in doing whatever a dame needed or wanted, instead of doing whatever he wanted to do.

The plane ride was going well too, until he noticed the extensive amount of lightning going and thinking back about the file he had read about Thor, the God of Thunder, and the relationship he should have with Loki - who, now that he looked at the other man, didn't look all that good.

When the blond god came into their plane and took Loki from the hull, He jumped after him, hoping to be able to talk to the other man on what had happened with Loki, and what could happen in the near future, if they didn't treat carefully.

Sadly enough, he wasn't able to do so, as the good Captain came between them before a word could be uttered. Luckily, Thor was persuaded in going along with them to the Hellicarrier - to lock up his brother and see what could happen next.

Sighing, the genius couldn't help but think that for being the older brother, he didn't act like it - wasn't even all that invested in his younger brothers deeds and what was happening, which he found odd.

Finally, back on the Hellicarrier, he took his time to let Harry know where they were, and to get some alone time from the people he found stupid in the steering room of said flying craft. He hoped his boyfriend would show up soon, or anyone really, that he could talk to.

After everything that Fury had tried to do, with the agent being sent to spy on them, he wanted as little to do with SHIELD as possible, not to mention Captain Sparkles, who it seemed had already decided he didn't like him.

It made Tony scoff, he didn't need a relic from times past to approve or disapprove of what he did or didn't do - least of all Capsicle who was only defrosted a few months ago.

Shaking his head a few times, he was happy to hear Harry telling him that he was on route, as well as the Brit letting him know he knew just what Lady Death had meant by look for Loki's eyes. It would give them something to work with, especially with what to come.

Making his way back to the steering room, he wasn't even surprised to see all of them sitting there, around a table with their hands in their hair, not knowing what they could do now that they had Loki but had no idea where the Tesseract was.

Making his was towards a chair, Tony was surprised to see Bruce Banner coming out of a side room. Looking around, seeing the smirk on the redhead's face, he couldn't help but roll his eyes, trust the Black Widow to try and recruit a person who didn't want to come back to America. It did seem she managed to recruit him, even if Bruce's eyes spoke of a fear of himself and what he could do.

Smiling, he approached the other doctor in the room and held out a hand to shake, telling the other that he liked his study on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled, and I am a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous, green rage monster.

Fury took this moment to step out from whatever place he was hiding at, ""Dr. Banner is only here to look for the Tesseract, I was hoping you could join him, Dr. Stark.""

Tony grinned, ""I'd love to, but I'm waiting on someone.""

This had most of the people around looking up in confusion, Fury's face on the other hand was showing anticipation, of course the man knew who they were missing.

""I was just going to ask where Black was, Stark.""

Tony just grinned, as a British voice came from behind the other man, ""I am right here, Nick, although I can't say I am particular happy to see you.""

The whole of the room turned to look at the man approaching them, his black hair and green eyes making them think about Loki, except for the fine that his facial structure was very different, the hair length wasn't the same, and the gleam in his eyes spoke of excitement, and joy, instead of rage and indifference.

""Lord Black, glad to see you joining us.""

Harry scoffed, ""you did invite me, Nick, I just let the others handle the heavy lifting, my expertise lay somewhere else.""

Tony snorted at that, before looking away as he felt stares on him, a grin playing on his lips - he knew that Harry was the strongest person here, and should he be in Germany, everything would be solved in a matter of seconds.

Captain America seemed to want to say something, only being beaten by Thor taking a step forward.

""What is it, you expertise in, Lord Black.""

Harry grinned, ""I am glad you asked Thor Odinson, I am one of the enhanced of this world. My power is an inherited magic, not unlike the one most Asgardians possess. I know Nick here called me in, because I have a fair hand at Magics from other worlds - Asgard included.""

The Thunderer looked shocked that Midgard had a sorcerer's community, most likely because as much as Asgard saw themselves at the top of the food chain, they stopped watching out for the other worlds, thinking them concurred.

Turning to Tony, Harry took a step forward, before going back to facing Thor.

""Tell me, Odinson, what is the colour of your brother's eyes?""

Thor frowned, ""Loki is known for having very vivid eyes, almost like your own.""

Harry hummed, ""then, isn't it absurd that the feed from the bunker show his eyes to be blue. The same blue even, as the SHIELD agent, and Dr. Selvig are shown to have after the sceptre tap them.""

This had everyone gaping at him, with Fury asking for prove of that, ""how would you know?""

Harry looked at the one-eyed man, ""because I looked up footage of Loki in New Mexico, where he was shown to have green eyes. By asking Thor here, I could be sure I was right.""

Nodding at Tony, the Stark let the images on his phone appear on the screens in the Hellicarrier, showing Loki in New Mexico, and after that showing him again in the bunker - the difference in eye colour highlighted.

Fury blinked a few times, ""so Loki is as much a victim in all this, just like Barton and Selvig are?""

Harry nodded, ""if you can get me a few moments with Loki, I am sure I will be able to knock him out of it. The force controlling him, won't be easy to break, but I know a way to get him out of it.""

Thor looked at him, ""how would you be able to do that. For all that Loki is a magnificent sorcerer, the being able to get him under their spell must be even more powerful.""

Harry looked at Tony, before turning to Thor again, ""the being who had your brother under his control is the Mad Titan, Thunderer. Who with his army of children is able to accomplish this without any problem.""

Thor opened and closed his mouth, ""the Mad Titan is a myth, a bedside story, he is not a real person.""

Harry scoffed, ""sure, so are Gods here, but yet, here you are. So is Captain America, who for all we knew died in World War II. Every myth and legend have their origins somewhere.""

 

With the permission he got from Fury, Harry made his was towards the cell they were holding Loki in, the glass cage - which had originally been made to contain the Hulk, showed the Norse God to be pacing and muttering to himself.

It would have shown Loki just standing there grinning and looking confident, but Harry had enough experience with glamour charms to know when one had been cast, and how to look past it. It was the same with the glamour hiding Loki's too thin body, bags under his eyes and greasy hair - in all, the God looked like he was help is captivity, which he most likely was.

The man suddenly stopped, showing Harry a glimpse of green eyes, before the blue took over again, and with it a cruel smile came to the other's face.

""What is this, a mortal coming to visit me?""

Harry scoffed, ""I came to visit Loki, not anyone keeping him hostage.""

The grin widened, ""you are the first to see this, mortal, that we keep a firm grip on his mind, how he pleaded not to. To die instead of the torture we put him through, and how fun it was. To see him break, to see his sanity and will decrease piece, by piece, until there was nothing left.""

Harry frowned, ""so you admit that this is not Loki?""

Loki's captor grinned, ""but who will believe you, when his own brother didn't even see, didn't even want to see.""

Looking at the camera hanging just outside the cell, the person controlling Loki grinned wider, ""he called for you, Thunderer, believed you would come and save him, just as you did when you were children. Yet, when you never came, he became ours.""

Harry could only contemplate on what Thor was doing now, knowing what he knew now, and how he would react to this piece of news. That even after everything that had happened, Loki still believed that he, his big brother, would come and save him.

Harry tried to make eye contact and succeeded, allowing himself to be pulling into the mindscape of Loki, which was shared with the being controlling him. As he looked around, he could see Loki chained and unresponsive in a corner. While a grey skinned alien was standing in the middle of the mindscape, his or its features reminding him a bit of Squidward, from a show he once watched with Teddy.

""You are foolish, mortal. To think coming here will free him.""

Harry let out a cruel laugh, ""and why is that?""

The Squidward lookalike grinned coldly, ""because now it will give me access to your own mind.""

Harry scoffed, ""I'd love to see you try, but alas, I am not here for that. I am here to break your hold over Loki, and all others who you have under the spell of the Mind Stone.""

The being stopped, ""you have knowledge of the Infinity Stones.""

Harry grinned, ""I have a lot of knowledge, I also know of who your master is, and I know he is going to lose.""

The being hissed, ""there will be no such thing, My Lord will conquer the universe and prove his worth to Lady Death in a way that she deserves. By eradicating half the universe in her honour.""

Harry snorted again, ""your 'Master' is mad to think that he can mess with a primordial being, and even more so that he would dare to disrupt the balance in the multiverse, by unbalancing this universe, just for his delusions about Lady Death.""

Seeing the beings hands start to clench, Harry knew he almost had him, too bad everyone always forgot how concentrated they got on the anger they felt, instead of on the task they were doing. He could feel the control slipping, even if the other hadn't noticed, too gone in his anger to see what Harry was doing.

""You dare question Lord Thanos' vision, he will rule all, Mortal, and I will look on and watch as he eradicates your planet.""

Harry laughed, loudly, ""I'd love to see him try, he picked the wrong universe to think he would succeed. He'll never win here, no matter what he tries.""

Seeing the being step over to him, a hand movement predicting just what was to come next. Harry leaning out of the way of whatever magic the being tried to cast at him, grinning even wider as he saw the control slipping further, glancing over at Loki, he could see the God coming to, looking on in awe at the way Harry was challenging and daring the other to respond.

When the alien stepped a bit to close, Harry wrapped a hand around its throat, using his own magic to constrict its movement.

""Tell your master that he would need to conquer the Master, Merchant and Champion of Death, before he can even thing of wrecking this universe.""

With that Harry threw the man away, and out of Loki's mind, using his own magic to stop him from entering again, until Loki had the ability to lock him out himself.

Making his was to the God, he waved his hand to take off the bindings holding him, watching them vanish in thin air, and the God stand.

""Am I to go from one Master to the Next, then?""

Harry shook his head, ""I'm here to set you free and to give you your own mind back, I won't stay any longer than I need to be here.""

Looking suspiciously at Harry, Loki swallowed, ""then what is it you want?""

Harry shrugged, ""nothing, Lady Death asked us to look for clues in your eyes, which we did. With me pushing Squidward out, the others under the influence of the mind stone should be fine too and coming to their senses any moment now.

The Mad Titan will be pissed though, but we prepared for that - he can try all he wants, he won't get past Earth, not on our watch.""

Loki gaped at him, ""you know of what the Mad Titan plans to do, to the universe, and of he could, to the Multiverse.""

Harry nodded, ""Lady Death filled me in, she asked us to save you, then having you in your own mind will be very beneficial for us. And if I have to be honest, I look forward to having someone else to talk magic with. While my boyfriend tries, and is a great conversationalist, he doesn't have magic, and can't talk shop with me in a way another Magic user can.""

Loki glanced at him, ""that is all you look for, and all you want when you free me?""

Harry nodded, ""you look like you could use a friend, and I would gladly provide that.""

Back in the control room, everyone was looking on a screen to see what this Lord Black was going to do. Tony and Banner were also staying and waiting, mostly because Tony knew that whatever Harry was going to do would make it unnecessary for them to look for the Tesseract.

Seeing the looks on the others faces when the person controlling Loki talked and admitted to Loki not being in control of his action, or even lucid in what was happening. Out of the corner of his eyes he could see Thor wincing when the being turned and told them all that Loki had been waiting for Thor to find and rescue him.

Thor looked away after that, ""I was told he was dead, that I shouldn't go looking. How wrong we had all been.""

Tony frowned, ""hate to break it to you, Point Break, but sometimes you have to go against any advice anyone gives you and find out for yourself what is really going on.""

He could see Captain America scoffing next to him, making his roll his eyes at the man, much to his displeasure and Tony's secret delight. Turning his eyes back onto the screen, he could see the moment Harry entered Loki's mind, he also noticed when they came out - it might have looked like not even a minute, but Tony knew it could be hours - the mind was an intricate place, where an outsider could get lost in.

Seeing Harry glance at the camera, Tony smiled and took a seat, making the others look at him.

""Stark, shouldn't you go and look for the Tesseract?""

Tony shook his head, ""nah, Harry solved that issue, any moment now you'll be getting a message from Agent Barton, Nick. The hold the Mind Stone had over them is broken without the Other helping it keep control.""

As he said, not even 60 seconds after Tony said this, both Fury's phone and the Black Widow's went off, signalling they had a text.

As they look startled at the screen, before looking at Tony, the genius snorted, ""called it.""

The blond next to him spoke, ""or it could just be luck, Stark.""

Glancing at the Super Soldier, Tony rolled his eyes again, ""sure it is, Capsicle, or it could be me trusting in someone I know very well, as well as having faith in his abilities.""

""Nice to know you believe in me, Tones.""

Grinning at the Brit as he approached, Loki at his side, before rolling his eyes when the blond next to him got up and started advancing, ""he can't be out of his cell, he's a criminal.""

This had all those around him tilting an eyebrow, ""Captain, which part of Mind Control didn't you understand. For us all, Loki is as much a victim of the person controlling him, as Agent Barton and Professor Selvig are.""

""Still, he killed people, this does not excuse that behaviour.""

Tony blinked, before looking at Harry, Fury and back to the Captain, ""and what does a soldier do, Captain? Do they not kill the enemy. I can assure you that almost everyone in this room has killed, you included, or what do you think happened to the Nazi soldiers you bashed in the head?""

The captain looked uncomfortable, before glaring at Tony, ""what would you know Stark, you made an empire on weapons, war and back-hand deals.""

Harry whistled, ""wow, where did he get his information? Let me tell you, Captain, that Tony made his fortune with innovating the world, and yes this included weaponry until recently - a branch of SI started by Howard Stark.

Not only that, but Tony loved to go more technological, instead of into warfare, but the person stopping that was his own Godfather, and in the end the person who did the back-hand deals and a traitor in the eyes of all America.

You have obviously been getting faulty information, which could be very harmful in the long run, after all, Fury called us here thinking we could be a team the world needed when it gets the inevitable invasion or confrontation.""

Fury looked at Harry, his eyes glaring at both him and the Stark.

""You both know more then you let on.""

Harry glared right back, ""I'm not inclined to share, Nick, not after you send a spy to my company - a company which employs a lot of people who would be jeopardised when others found out something, they aren't ready to tell.""

Fury looked away, knowing that Harry had a lot of enhanced folks working for him, most of those who hadn't told people close to them yet, others were of the Magical Community and would unintentionally out that part of the world when Natasha infiltrated.

""At least tell me measures are in place.""

Harry grinned dangerously, ""who do you think I am, Nick, of course I have measures in place in the event of anything happening.""

The super soldier seemed to want to talk back on that, but everyone was ignoring him, taking this time to talk and get to know each other. Especially now that the Tesseract would be making its way back to them, instead of them having to find it.

Loki stayed close to Harry, even if he seemed to want to approach his brother but didn't dare or didn't know how.

Tony, Harry, and Loki followed by Thor made their way to a different room in the Hellicarrier. With Barton texting them that he was on route with Selvig, and several other mind-controlled Agents, carrying the tesseract with him.

Feeling like their work here was done, neither Tony, nor Harry wanted to stay in the Hellicarrier any longer than they needed to do. Tony telling Bruce he should consider doing the same, as SHIELD didn't have the best history with enhanced.

Looking up, they could see that the gamma specialist had followed them to much more secluded area, away from the mass of agents in the control room, as well as the SHIELD agent that had recruited him.

Tony wrapped an arm around Harry's waist, sometimes hating that the Brit was that little taller than him, making it impossible to wrap an arm around his shoulders, ""found out anything else while you were snooping around?""

Harry tilted an eyebrow, ""not more than what JARVIS found out when he hacked into the mainstream, I would guess.""

Tony beamed at him, ""great, so there are no more problems we have to keep in mind then.""

Harry rolled his eyes, ""this is SHIELS, Tony, we always have to keep them in mind, especially now that the first steps have been made to enter Earth into the intergalactic playing field so to say. Which will not help us, now that Thanos has his eyes set on this planet.""

Bruce looked between the two Asgardians, before turning to Tony and Harry, ""who is Thanos?""

A voice popped up from behind them, ""that's something I would like to know as well.""

Turning towards the door, they could see Coulson, followed by Steve Rogers, entering the room, almost all of them rolling their eyes at the blond who had spoken. He might have been a big shot in the War, but times change.

Looking at Coulson, Harry glared, to which the man gave a sheepish look back. The Super soldier, having seen the interaction took a step towards Harry, to which the Brit only turned and stared right on back.

""Is there a problem, soldier?""

Harry scoffed, ""nothing that concerns you.""

Bristling, the blond rightened his shoulders, before saying, ""as team leader, is does concern me.""

Tony burst out laughing, ""and who made you team leader? If you hadn't noticed, there is no team to lead. Harry here made sure the issue was solved before it became a problem, which means SHIELD is keeping us here without a reason - or because they haven't been totally honest with us - which might as well be the case.""

This had Coulson looking away, to which both Tony and Harry looked at the guy, seeing right through him.

""Let me guess, you got an order from higher up to detain us until such a time you were certain none of us is a threat. Not only that, but with blondie here, you're expecting us all to get along like children, while you already know that isn't going to happen.

Not only that, but you probably expect both Harry and I to keep on track, maybe even finance this whole gig, as SHIELD doesn't have a great number of funding - I wonder why that is. The answer to that question is also a no, by the way, we both have a lot of other things to do with the money we make.""

Rogers scoffed, ""like what, feed your own riches.""

Harry sighed, ""no, make sure our businesses keep on booming and keep on making innovations in all kinds of fields. Not only that, but a good portion of both our money goes into our employees, our interns, and into the education of their children. To make sure the right people get selected, regardless of race, colour, background or even sexuality - this takes time and money to realise.

Keeping at the top of the line, with great options for our employees, as well as making sure we find new employees takes money, effort and time, all things we're wasting here, all because SHIELD can't keep their promises, surprise, surprise.""

Coulson just winces, which makes Harry roll his eyes, the man knew what he did was wrong, over riding JARVIS just to get access to the tower, and in turn them, all the while their family was still present in said tower.

When the Super soldier once more glared at him, Harry couldn't help to roll his eyes, seeing Tony and even Loki doing the same thing. This would be fun to see play out, if the blond actually though he could 'lead' a group of enhanced with such an attitude.

The tension in the room only worsened, with Rogers being the one to bring on the most of it, most likely not liking that he wasn't followed like he was used to being. Neither Tony nor Harry were followers, and he suspected Thor and Loki to also not be one.

Silence kept on going, until Harry's phone went off, the theme suggesting it was Remus calling him.

""Yes.""

""Harry, what the hell is going on? The television shows a large hole in the New York skyline, with several being making their way through. I thought you said you'd solve this before it even began?""

Harry looked at Loki, seeing the man still the same, with green eyes, as well as no sign he was still possessed.

""Are you all safe?""

Remus hummed on the other side, ""we are, but I fear for New York City, as well as its people. I know Charles is planning on sending the X-man down, and several other enhanced have been seen in the area. The warning you send out put all of them on high alert.""

Harry cursed, before looking at Tony, who most likely had listened in on the conversation with his earpiece.

""Coulson, who took the tesseract?""

Coulson frowned, ""Rumlow, and some other great agents, why?""

Harry hissed, ""because they betrayed you and used the tesseract anyway to open up a portal like the person possessing Loki was trying to do. It just went active over New York City. We need to get out there.""

Without waiting for anything else, the Brit turned on his heel and apparated, to hell with others knowing just what he was, this was one of the largest cities on the planet, they couldn't just let Thanos get his way.

Standing on the penthouse floor of Stark Tower, he looked up as he heard another pop, Loki, and Thor, as well as Bruce appearing next to him. The dark haired God having taken them all with him.

""Stark is flying here as we speak, what can we do?""

Harry frowned, ""we need to clear the streets and keep it all contained as much as possible, if I am guessing correct, we should be getting back-up in a few moments.""

As he said that, a voice sounded in his mind, ""Harry, what is going on, I'm sending Storm, Logan, Scott and Jean over to you - we saw something on the television and asked Remus what was going on. I have confirmation from several other enhanced that they are in the area and want to help.""

Harry hummed, ""we'll have that promised back up in about 10 minutes. Does anyone know who else will come?""

The earpiece he still carried had some static before Tony's voice was heard.

""I'm on route, and I could see Barton, Widow and Capsicle taking off at around the same time, so I'll be there in 20, the others in 30, I assume we'll have backup in NYC as well?""

""Yeah, Charles is sending in the big guns, and told me several enhanced were roaming the city in an effort to help.""

Tony hummed before the line went dead, Harry looking outside to see several large ship like creatures coming out of the portal.

""Thor, think you can put a stop to everything that comes out of that portal? Loki and I will do our best to evacuate the civilians, with the help of the others soon to arrive.""

Turning to Bruce, he asked, ""Dr. Banner, will the hulk be an option?""

The scientists winced, ""I'd rather not...""

Harry nodded, before taking out another earpiece, ""then stay here and keep up posted on anything you see, will you?""

The relief on the other's face was palpable, which made Harry, and Loki as far as he could see, angry on behalf of the man. To know he wasn't given that much of a choice in recent years was something to get mad about.

Nodding once more, Loki and Harry disappeared and appeared on the ground, trying to help as many people as possible, while also fighting off any aliens that did come through the portal. Thor swung Mjolnir and let it carry him in the air - shooting out lightning as he reached the same altitude as the portal.

Bruce meanwhile kept on calling out street names where help was needed.

Losing himself into the fight, Harry was pleasantly surprised when a force field stopped an alien blast from throwing him off of his feet, looking up he met Sue's eyes, and smiled, it had seemed the fantastic four were also here to help.

Looking around he could make out several X-men, the defenders, and some others that didn't belong to any specific group. The sound of thrusters made him look up to see both Tony and Rhodey in the air, going after aliens together with Johnny and Storm.

It had also been a while since he heard Bruce calling out any streets where there was trouble brewing, making the Brit take a deep breath, before concentrating on the aliens closing in on all of them, most likely seeing then as the last line of defence against them taking over.

""Where are the others?""

""I don't know, they left at the same time I did and should have already been here, don't know though.""

A voice suddenly came through, recognizable as the Black Widow, ""we found the tesseract and can close to portal.""

At the same time Nick Fury's voice came through to Harry and Tony, telling them the counsel of SHIELD had made the unanimous decision to nuke New York and everyone in it, in an effort to contain the invasion.

Cursing loudly, both of them called for the Widow to wait, while Tony rushed towards the nuke, to bring it up into the portal, in an effort to take out as many of Thanos' forces as possible. When the Widow didn't listen, and all of them saw Tony disappear into the wormhole, Harry kept the portal open - or tried to do so - with his magic, feeling Loki and even Lady Death helping until the red and gold armour fell through again.

Biting his lip, he watched as Tony's arc reactor stayed out, until Rhodey caught his best friend and gave the reactor a boost to start working again, making all of them heave a sigh on relief at knowing the genius hadn't died (again).

Thanking Lady Death, he could feel her brushing against his mind, letting him know where the others were - just outside the city - and that they didn't wait to close the portal because they didn't seem to think Tony Stark was irrelevant to the greater scheme of things. It made his angry, but he would deal with that later. For now, he ran towards Tony, pulled off the face plate and kissed the other man right there and then, forgetting for a moment that a lot of cameras were on them and as such their secret was out.

Twinkling eyes met his as he pulled back, ""now that's a welcome back, green eyes.""

Harry just laughed wetly, ""you could have died, you ass, you deserved it. And I got tired of everyone thinking you're in a relationship with Pepper, or anyone else, when you're mine.""

Tony grinned, ""as, so possessive.""

Harry shut him up again with a kiss, much to the delight of their friends, or people who knew them, who had seen the two businessmen getting close in the last 3 years. Rhodey just beamed at them, but then again, he had known about their relationship since it started roughly 6 months ago.

With assisting the clean-up and Christine and Stephen coming over as soon as their shift at the hospital was over to check on all of them, it took them quite a while to get back to the tower.

Saying goodbye and thank-you to all of those that helped with making sure there were almost no casualties during the invasion, as well as making sure all the right authorities were informed of what had happened, what had almost happened and what would have happened should they let it happen - to make sure measures were put in place to start thinking about this in the future.

Seeing and waving off the last of the representatives of the CIA, MI6 and FBI, Tony and Harry made their way into their home, happy that at least the wards held up against the invading forces and all that was left was a little bit of clean-up.

Thor and Loki followed them into the tower, the blond one of the two telling Tony how brave he was to fly that device into the wormhole, and impressive to be able to survive it. He and Harry exchanged a look but didn't say anything.

For now, the less people knew of their status with Lady Death, the better, especially when they could use it as their triumph card against Thanos when the Mad Titan did make it to Earth in person.

The moment they entered the tower, JARVIS spoke, ""Sirs, Dr. Banner asked me to inform you that the others entered roughly an hour ago and didn't seem inclined to help with clean-up out there. As a matter of fact, they helped themselves to the drinks in the penthouse and kept on seated, even after Dr. Banner asked them to go and see if anyone needed help out there.""

Harry blinked, ""JARVIS, is there footage of that conversation?""

""There is, Master Harry.""

""Be a dear and throw that online, as well as send it to any available agency, it's high time we let the world know what kind of person Captain America and his cronies actually are. Throw in our request of them waiting to close the portal seeing as tony just flew through - and follow it up with their recorded answer of not seeing the point of waiting for that to happen.

I don't want to be associated with those kind of people, or even worse, for them to be associated with us when we did all the work and all they seem to be capable of doing is running around with other people's honour.

And while you're at it, look at any and all mission reports of mission the Howling Commando's went on, if he's doing it with us, chances are this is behaviour he did before.""

Loki whistled, ""you really don't like this Captain America.""

Harry scoffed, ""I don't like people who take things at face value, and who don't know how to look up anything for their own. I noticed that even if the report says he's been out of the ice, he didn't try to catch up with whatever has been happening in the last 75 years.

Not only that, but he took the word of people he didn't know and talked trash about the son of one of his supposed best friends, even if Howard Stark wasn't the man, I know him to be, this is no way of talking about your friend's son - at any given time.""

Loki nodded, ""I agree with you there, Sorcerer.""

Harry grinned, ""just call me Harry, he's Tony, by the way - neither of us want to be called by our titles, trust me when I tell you there are far too many.""

The moment the elevator opened up, Harry was storming up at the people sitting in their couch, drinking from their beverages, and who seemed content to take up any place in their home, just because.

""Get out and expect the bill of what you have just opened, one of those bottles was a vintage scotch.""

Rogers got to his feet, ""now see here.""

Harry scoffed again, ""no, you see here, you try and have my boyfriend killed all because you think he doesn't matter, all the while there was no one else who could have flown that nuke into the wormhole. Add to that, that when we explain the situation, you were all happy to close it anyway - because Tony Stark didn't matter anyway.

This is your only warning, the footage has been made public already, as I refuse to be associated with people like you. If you aren't off out property in the next 10 seconds, I'll have our lawyers add trespassing, vandalism and theft onto the charges I am sure Pepper and Remus will slap onto you three.""

Barton seemed to be the only one started into complying, getting up and making his way to the elevator, a cell phone to his ear as he was talking to a Laura.

Romanov and Rogers on the other hand, just kept on sitting where they were, a look on their face that didn't spell all that much good.

Harry sighed, before pressing a button on his cell phone, a rough voice answering on the other side.

""What's up, bud?""

""Logan, did you and the others leave already?""

""Nah, there's a great pizza place near here, we went to get takeout, brought you and the others some back too.""

Harry sighed, ""want to help me take out the trash?""

A rough laugh was all he needed to hear before he ended the call, a grin coming up his face, ""last chance, get the hell out of my home.""

Even Romanov seemed to be doubting now, her face betraying that what she guessed or observed wasn't the truth, in an effort to contain the situation, she smiled coyly at the both of them, to which Tony only wrapped an arm around Harry's waist.

""Back up, Widow, this one is taken.""

The redhead didn't give up, ""I saw, don't you want those images contained, I know SHIELD would be happy to ...""

Harry started laughing, ""SHIELD would be happy to what? Contain those images for them, so we'd be in their dept? Not in a hundred years would I want to be indebted with SHIELD, not with all they tried to pull with sending you in to spy on us.

As for the information, we don't really care, and have been talking about coming out a few times, this will only endear us more to people of this age.""

Rogers growled, ""so it's all a publicity stunt, figured with rich people.""

To their surprise, it was Loki and Thor who came to their defence, ""you obviously have been very narrowminded if you don't recognize the love between Lord Harry and Sir Tony, after all I know I wouldn't be able to go and check up on my loved one had they have fallen from such hights.""

Loki scoffed, ""not only that, but I find it particular that you would take away that part of the conversation, at this moment, the ones who endear themselves to the internet generation have the most votes, the most acknowledgement and will stay with a whole generation, multiple generations, while others will fade into the background.

You are already running late to the start, Captain, I wouldn't endanger your own reputation before it could craws back from where it was put on ice.""

The doors of the elevator opened to reveal Rhodey, who had gone to check up on an army base a few miles out of NYC, just to bring them up to date, and to make sure the brass knew what had happened and to find out who in their right mind thought it to be a great idea to nuke NYC.

He was joined by Coulson, who couldn't even look them into the eye. Rogers and Romanov approached him in a second when the man beckoned them, making Harry roll his eyes, before he caught Coulson's eye.

""Tell Fury we're off the consultants list, he should have thought ahead before pulling all this shit on us. Not only that, but make sure you keep dumb and dumber away from us, will you - you won't like what happens if we see both of them again.""

As they turned to leave, the elevator opened again, this time showing the X-man coming through, Logan's arms stacked up to his head with pizza boxed from the little pizza place Tony loved. He could see his lover's eyes beginning to shine at the boxes.

Logan grinned and nudged the top box to the genius, which held a load of peperoni on them, as well as a written note from Alfredo, the cook, to thank him for what he did for NYC today.

Putting the boxes down, Logan came to stand next to Harry, ""this the trash?""

Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on all three of the SHIELD assets, ""yeah, but they were just leaving. Weren't you.""

Rogers seemed to want to say anything, but with Logan taking a menacing step forward, and Romanov and Coulson taking an old of his arms he let himself be carted away into the elevator, and later out of the building - Harry made sure to check security feeds, to make sure they actually left.

Part of him wanted them to have stayed, so he could let Pepper and Remus know they could slap some more lawsuits onto them all.

Turning around again, he smiled at the people sitting in their penthouse, Tony pulling him down onto the couch as soon as he put his tablet down to make sure the others were gone, showing his favourite pizza in his hands, a bit telling him it was divine, as he had come to expect from New York pizza.

Loki and Thor were discovering Pizza, although he remembered reading that Thor had already eaten pizza once before when he met Dr. Foster's team. The X-men were talking among themselves, or with Tony and Rhodey about what had happened out there today.

Bruce had joined them, at a sedated pace, apologizing for not doing anything against Rogers, Romanov, and Barton - to which Harry and Tony just waved him off. Even if the Hulk was quite a sight to see, Bruce Banner liked the quiet background, like a true scientist he was happy to look and see what happened instead of interfering with anything that happened.

Jean made a point of trying to talk to Bruce soon after, the red haired woman smiling slightly at Bruce, and made a comment on his last paper on the changes of modern day medicine, even in hard to reach areas, mostly fed by his own adventures into the rural parts of the world, trying to help people who wouldn't be able to afford medical costs in normal circumstances.

Eating their pizza, all of them made sure to talk to Tony some more, Jean, also with medical expertise, made sure to check him over, even if Stephen and Christine did so already - just to be sure nothing had happened yet.

The last time the elevator doors opened, it was to show Remus, Dora, Andy, and Teddy running in to check on Tony, and the others, they had come over as soon as they had seen what had happened but needed to go through a check point before, they were allowed into the city.

Coming after them, at a more sedated pace, was Pepper and Happy, at a more sedated pace, after all Pepper's extended belly made them all aware of just what had happened in these last few months. After getting her hand in marriage, she and Happy hadn't waited that long to get married and in true Weasley fashion, it didn't take long for the redhead to get pregnant.

As the last one to get hitched and to get pregnant, all of her brothers were delighted and wished her well, even if that would turn into worry the moment, they saw what happened to Tony and Harry here in New York City.

Jean and Storm approached the pregnant woman, congratulating her on the little bundle of joy, while the Black-Lupin family were checking in on everyone, Remus and Andy taking care to look Tony over for the Third time, just to be sure.

Harry on the other hand, made sure to mail both Remus and Pepper about what had happened and what he wanted to do about it, before he put his tablet down for good, and was happy to just lean against Tony and enjoy his friends and family around him. Who knows how long that would last.

With the whole 'the Avengers' part behind them, Harry and Tony had time to focus on their efforts on using Starkanium in appliances for Wizarding households, especially since Starkanium had shown to be a very good conductor for magic, and resistant to a lot of outside force.

If anything, it resembled Adamantium and Vibranium in a lot of aspects, only it was non-toxic, and unlike the other two did conduct magic, which made it more of use for the plans Tony and Harry had for the merged project between MI and SI.

So, with that part behind them, and SHIELD substantially cowed to leave them alone, they could concentrate on that.

It had both of them, together with a team from both SI, and MI, all of whom were sworn into the secrets of the Magical community, or who belonged with it, standing in a meeting room where Tony was explaining the components of Starkanium and the things he and Harry had thought about, but now needed help with to accomplish.

As expected, all of the people they had gathered were very interested, and excited to be helping with that, especially since this was something so unique and ground-breaking - nothing could go wrong with this.

""Mister Stark, does this mean that we can make a prosthetic that could possibly be charmed to grow with the person that receives it.""

Tony nodded, ""we hypothesized that it could, but of course we need to run test before this can get to the public, but this is one of the project we want to endeavour, partly to also help our veterans, and veterans all over the world.""

Several people started to clap at that, they had several veteran family members, some who had become an amputee after their tour to Iraq or Afghanistan. To know that there would be a prosthetic on the market soon that would be able to last them their whole lives instead of them having to get refitted every few months or years was amazing to know.

Tony smiled, ""I'm still looking for people to add to that project group, as well as a group who will work more closely with MI in implementing Starkanium into electronics to make them last longer in a magical environment. Seeing as my people are more on point in the prosthetics department, even if we're a world leader in electronics, none of mine are knowledgeable in Magical - not that I know of anyway.""

Several people shuffled closer to Tony, while others did the same to Harry, both CEO's laughed, they had done these things more times already and all the time they told the people in their project group to go and stand with the person whose company the project would do they wanted in on.

It was a great way to exchange interns, or even scientist who had a personal attachment to a certain project, it was one of the reasons both of them had chosen interns, or mostly inters who either were magical, or who were known the have veteran relatives.

To know everyone in their companies knew how they did things like this was so rewarding to know. Especially since it saved them time in explaining their way of working.

With their groups formed, Harry pressed a kiss to Tony's lips before taking his group to a level reserved for these kinds of project in the Stark Tower, it helped that they were still in the same building but working on different project and able to get help with the other group, but also get to MI, or SI, in help with general things regarding the project.

A knock on the door had Harry looking up, to see Pepper entering, with baby Colin in his stroller.

Beaming at his other godson, the one he shared with Tony, Harry abandoned the project group to go and great his best friend, pressing a soft kiss to Colin's forehead when he approached.

""It's great to see you, Pep, shouldn't you still be resting?""

Pepper waved a hand at him, ""please don't, I already heard that from Happy, while rest is nice after giving birth, I was going crazy just staying at home. So, Colin and I thought it to be a great idea to come and look what Uncle Tony and Uncle Harry were doing.""

Harry grinned, ""well we're glad to have you.""

While he walked back to his group, he explained to Pepper what they were trying to do, the redheads eyes widening at the possibilities.

""Dad would love to look over these revolutions.""

Harry sighed, he and Pepper, not the Weasley boys, talked about their father a lot, so for Pepper to bring him up meant she knew something, or that something that happened that made talking about him so much easier.

Looking at her, he arched an eyebrow.

Pepper sighed, ""Molly died in her sleep last week, from what I gathered she had to much stress these last years and her heart just gave out. If you ask me; she deserves it, for all the things she put all of us through.""

Harry sighed, wrapping an arm around Pepper, ""but she still was your mother.""

Pepper sniffed and rubbed at her eyes, ""biologically maybe, but I had a lot more support and whatnot from Andy then I ever got from her. And let's not talk about all the things she said and tried to do to you.""

Harry sighed, and pulled his best friend close, ""but she still was your mother.""

He could feel Pepper nod against his chest while tears soaked through his shirt, looking up at his project group he said, ""why don't you all take 10, get some fresh air, a drink and a snack.""

All of the interns, and the two employees that completed the group seemed to disappear, he was glad that they had read the situation. He was even more surprised when a few moments later Happy and Tony stepped into the room.

The first coming and taking his wife from Harry to hug her close, he had of course known what had happened, but it warmed his heart that Pepper had a man that loved her for however she was, and who tried to keep track of her family, which wasn't easy with all those brothers she had.

Even more, he agreed to name their son after her last fiance, who never made it back home after what happened in the UK, if that wasn't love he didn't know what was.

Tony leaned against him, ""so what was that about.""

Harry frowned, but told Tony all about Pepper's mother and what the woman had done for and to him, the good and the bad. He also told his lover about everything the woman had tried to do after the war, and how it impacted her family.

""She hasn't spoken to any of her children before her death, as far as I know all the boys didn't visit her, and neither do they see their father. Not after everything she did or tried to do. I mean it isn't healthy for a woman to try and keep all her grown children under one roof in fear of losing them - even if she did lose a son, and a future son-in-law in the war.""

Tony hummed, ""you have a point, but she is still their mother.""

Harry nodded, ""she's still their mother, I imagine the other are having as much of a difficult time with this as Pepper is having, maybe not as bad, as Pepper's still hyped up with pregnancy hormones.""

Tony hummed, ""do you want to go and check in on them?""

Harry shook his head, ""I don't plan on ever setting a foot back on magical UK soil, not after everything that happened. If they need me, or any of us, they'll know where to find us.""

Suddenly, Happy's radio gave a rush of noise, before the voice of Bobby, one of the main security guards sounded from it.

""Boss, I have a Neville and a Luna Longbottom here, asking to speak with either Mr. Potter or Ms. Potts.""

Harry sighed, ""or they send the cavalry in their stead.""

Pepper gave a wet giggle, to which Harry smiled at her, ""I'll go and collect Luna and Neville then, we'll be right back. Want to come along, Tony?""

The Stark nodded, looking forward to talking again to the blond couple, both of them had a rather refreshing view on the world around them - especially with both of them pureblood wizards, it was nice to know that some of them did their best to fit in when they entered the muggle world instead of embarrassing themselves like a lot of the older generations did.

With one last nod to Happy, both men entered the elevator and made their way to the ground floor, both looking forward to what Luna and Neville had to say about the situation in the UK, but also dreading it seeing as they came all the way to New York, so it had to be big news for them to come, or in the Weasley's case send someone, instead of writing a letter.

Once on the ground floor, they could spot the Longbottom couple from afar, with Luna's striking white, blond hair, and Neville's dirtier blond, they were still a sight to see. With Neville filling out in recent years, and Luna's dainty figure - they were a beautiful couple.

Bobby didn't seem to know what to do, and even looked relieved when he saw them coming his direction, making both Tony and Harry smile.

Before Tony could greet Luna and Neville however, Bobby pulled him aside.

""Mr. Stark, Sir, I had a certain Mr. Killian here, who seemed to be under the impression that Ms. Potts was CEO now and that he had something he wanted to show her. When I corrected him and told him that Ms. Potts was CFO, and you were still CEO, his face changed, and he turned and went back outside. I just wanted you to know, as I didn't like the look on his face.""

Tony frowned, but made a note to look up Killian's name, as it did sound familiar. But to know someone would just turn around and leave at hearing his name didn't sit well with him either.

""Thanks for letting me know, Bobby.""

He clasped the man on his shoulder, before he re-joined his lover and their friends in getting to know what the situation in the UK was like at the moment.

""Luna, Neville, lovely to see you both again, I hope all is well, considering the circumstances.""

Both blondes nodded, Luna accepting a kiss to her cheek, while Neville shook his hand with a wry grin on his face.

""I guess you could say they were alright. But we came here for a reason, is it possible to see Gin - I mean Pepper right now?""

Harry and Tony nodded, ""you're in luck, she decided to come to the office today, said she went crazy at home. Follow us, you can tell us all that has happened together.""

The other couple nodded as they followed the couple of CEO's, getting into the elevator and looking around quite shocked at what was going on around them. As neither had ever visited a skyscraper, this was not something that surprising.

Once back on the communal floor, Harry and Tony led the way to the conference room Pepper and Happy were in. Opening the door for them, they entered and saw that none of Harry's project helpers were back yet.

Arching an eyebrow at his lover, Tony said, ""I told them to stay with my minions for a bit, at least until we can get this over with. As much as I trust them all, I don't think they have a right to so much of our personal business, love.""

Harry hummed, ""you have a point there.""

Pepper in the meanwhile was saying hello to Neville and Luna, Happy just a step behind his wife, while keeping as eye on Colin who was still napping in his stroller.

Taking a seat, Luna looked at Pepper, ""your dad wants to meet up again, he knows that he was wrong to follow Molly in all she did. But after everything that happened, he had a feeling she was the only thing he still had. Now that she is gone, he wants to try and mend the bridges that were burned in the last decade.""

 


Pepper started crying at that, ""that's the first thing he asked, after all these years of no contact, he asks to meet up again to mend bridges Molly blew up, all because of the ridiculous notion that keeping us with her would protect us?



I was 18 by that time, and still forced to live at him because my psychotic mom couldn't deal with the fact that Percy died, I lost a brother too, but she never let us grieve in our won way. I just needed to get away from the UK, and luckily Harry saw that - or I would have wasted away in the Burrow.""



Before saying anything else, she turned and hid her face in Happy's chest, all of them could hear her sobbing, most likely because of what had happened, and what was happening now, as well as the fact that she never got to say goodbye to her Mother, no matter how much she didn't like the woman right now, that had still been her mother.



Harry sighed as he leaned against Tony, the shorter man taking his hand and resting his head on his shoulder, allowing Harry to rest his own head on the Iron Man's pilot.



""So now what?""



Luna and Neville sighed, ""Arthur went to each of his children, the one he knew where they lived, to try and ask for forgiveness. Even though he didn't find it. Fleur and Hermione just threw the door close in his face and didn't let him speak for siding with Molly over his own children.



Fred and George listened, but told him in no uncertain terms that they would stand together with their siblings in this, which at the moment isn't looking all that good for Arthur either.



We were asked to come and tell Gin - Pepper, and you, Harry, as he feels guilt towards the things Molly did to you, especially when you aren't planning on setting a foot back in the UK.""



Harry hummed, ""Not if I can help it, I'm indeed never setting a foot back in the UK, too many bad memories. Plus, I'm more than happy here, with Tony and Pepper and Happy, as well as other friends I made here.""



Luna nodded, ""also because your destiny is here.""



Harry nodded, ""it is, and I don't plan on running from it. Why don't I take you down to Dora, Andy, Remus, and Teddy, so you can all catch up. We still have work to do, and I think Pepper needs some time to process this.""



Neville nodded, ""we guessed as much, but yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I have some letters from Draco, Narcissa and Hermione here too, for most of you, but that's for later then.""



Harry gave a wry smile, lifted his head, before bending down and pressing a kiss to Tony's lips, before leading the blond couple out of the room.



Tony in the meantime turned to Happy, ""do you remember an Aldrich Killian?""



Happy frowned, before nodding, ""we met him at that convention in Bern, but as far as I know you never actually met with him when he asked you too. You spent the night with Maia Hansen then, haven't heard from him since, why?""



Tony shrugged, ""he apparently was here a few hours ago, Bobby told me that he was under the misconception that Pepper was CEO, and he had an idea he wanted to show to her. When Bobby told him; Pepper was CFO, and I was still CEO he pulled a face and left.""



""So that's what Bobby was telling you?""



Looking up, Tony grinned at Harry, ""he was, but I didn't think it was important, I'll ask my people to look into it, so we at least know what he's up to.""



Harry hummed, before pressing a kiss to Pepper's cheek as he went to find his group of project members to continue working on it. He hoped to have something usable soon, in an effort to show the market just what MI and SI were capable of together.



It also helped that he didn't have to do this alone. He was lucky to have Tony helping him, or at least SI employees who had some experience in the market they were branching out in. Especially with this he was looking forward to showing the world how it could progress and change. He also looked forward to the reactions of the enhanced community. It was after all for them and for the metrical community they were taking these steps to accomplish something that hadn't been done yet. 



Finding his team for the project, he mentioned them to follow him back to the conference room they were occupying before. As he was conversing with the two non-interns, he found their ideas to be very similar to his own. Which was both a good thing and the bad thing, he liked that their ideas aligned with his own. But he also feared that because of this they wouldn't get enough input to come up with new and innovative ideas for the future. 



The biggest problem he had with that was after getting to know just how brutal this business was. they would need to come up with new and innovative ideas on the fly if they wanted to keep the number one spot on the electronics market.



While it helped do you have a connexion with Stark Industries that didn't mean they could slack off as the 'newer partner'. In a way this was still a huge opportunity for MI to show themselves and to make a mark, chances where they would stay in this partnership with SI, but that didn't mean that MI couldn't leave behind their own footprints. Everyone already knew about SI, so it was only logical Harry wanted to put MI on the map, without doing anything competitive or damaging to Tony's image, or company.



 As he looked at the interns, he knew but not all hope was lost. These were college, University and even high school students who had a very different view of the world, which could leave them with ideas which are very out of the box.



it was what are the main reasons both Tony and Harry loved working with interns on their projects. He wouldn't be surprised if, as before, it was the interns that were given more leeway on these projects as they had contributed for the most part in the ideas that would shape the end result.



Both MI and SI believed in giving credit where credit was due, even if it meant putting interns above actual employees. Luckily, none of the employees that had worked on projects had taken offence on this. They too understood just what these interns had done for the project and remembered at time they had been interns and hadn't been given credit where credit was due.



As such most employees applauded both Tony and Harry for what they did for interns.



Entering the conference room, Harry was somewhat sad to see that Pepper and Happy weren't there anymore, but then again, after the bomb that had been dropped upon them, he knew they would need some time to themselves. He just hoped that this didn't put any unneeded stress onto Pepper.



Smiling at his project partners, Harry took out a tablet and linked it with the others in the room, one in front of each of the 5 other people he would be working with, until they could take over on their own. Showing the notes, he and Tony had done for this specific project, as well as the findings they had on the properties of Starkanium.



It also helped that both of them made sure to publish part of their research, either public under copyright laws, or internally on the server of SI and MI, which were protected by clauses employees signed when they started working for SI, or MI.



""Alright, this is all we have for now. I know my people at MI have some experience in adapting electronics to a magical environment, but now we want to take this one step further and make sure they are enhanced with, say, super strength, are able to use them without fear of breaking it.""



He got a lot of hums back, and left them all to their reading, while he checked his mail on the tablet, opening a chat with Tony and asking his lover how far he stood with his own project. He knew that Tony always had a faster start, one of the perks of having a genius mind, and with it, able to come to conclusions all that faster.



It also helped his project partners, as Tony never had any trouble following their thoughts process and picking up when they stalled or didn't know how to proceed. While Harry had to concur, he was smart, it was still different as he didn't have the mind Tony possessed, and had to help his people in a different way.



Seeing that most of them we're finished reading, he laid down his tablet and directed his attention to the group of five sitting around him. Smiling at Laura who was sitting next to him he asked, ""what are your thoughts about this "".



The girl blushed but said, ""I think you and Doctor Stark did most of the work for us. But I am very excited to start working on this.



Harry nodded, before turning to the next person, Mike, who said the same thing as Laura, just not in as many words. Mitchell and Alida did the same, which didn't surprise him in the slightest. It was however Hailey who did surprise him, she was the only high school student here, but that didn't stop her from pointing out certain features she was missing on the prototype he and Tony had drawn out.



Harry just smiled and nodded, giving her the confidence, she needed to tell him, and her peers, what she was missing and how she thought that could be incorporated into the device, saying that her brother was a mutant with super strength, who had managed to crush more than one phone when he wasn't paying attention.



Harry nodded and made note of that, telling the others that it was the end of the day, but it they had anything other to add, they were more than welcome to do so, after all, he and Tony were only 2 people, who did this when they had the time, but in the end, this was not their project, and the ones on it were welcome to add and discuss whatever they deemed necessary for the project they were on at that time.



As the conference room cleared out, Harry looked up when after the others left, the door opened again to show Tony coming in and taking a seat next to him.



""Quite the productive day, don't you think?""



Harry nodded, ""any hits on this Aldrich Killian fellow?""



Tony nodded, ""yeah, I remember him very vaguely, but still, to know he had the balls to come and see someone at SI must be something special. I did some digging into him and his company, AIM, but so far I haven't found anything significant yet.""



Grinning towards each other, they had just been planning on going in for a kiss, when the TV in the room turned on, with JARVIS' voice coming out of the speakers.



""I think you need to see this sirs.""



With that, the TV zoomed in on an apartment building that had been caught in an explosion, cause unknown, but there had been people killed, there were still some unaccounted for, and several others had been taken away to the hospital.



But that wasn't what triggered both of them, what did was the fact that this was the building the Potts-Hogan family lived in. Looking towards each other, Tony called Happy, while Harry tried to call Pepper. Only stopping when Pepper suddenly popped up with a crying Colin in her arms, her clothing dirty from ash and soot, while the woman herself seemed really close to crying.



""Happy, Happy told me to go with Colin as soon as that man started to glow, and I did, to protect Colin, but now I don't know what happened to Happy.""



Jumping up, Harry took his best friend in his arms as he looked at Tony, the man on the phone with someone. Hanging up, he said, ""That was Christine, Happy was admitted to the hospital, alive, but they're keeping him in a coma to deal with the wounds.""



Pepper held a hand over her mouth as she started crying again.



""Pep, Tony and I will go and deal with everything alright, Happy is tough, he'll be fine. I'm going to get you to Andy and Dora, alright, they'll look after you and Colin, while we deal with the hospital.""



Pepper nodded, letting Harry lead her to Andy, giving her a short version of what happened, the older woman just gasped, before putting an arm around Pepper and leading her inside, to calm her down. Harry could see Luna sweeping in and taking Colin while Andy and Dora hugged Pepper between them.



Making his way to the lobby, he looked at Tony and gave a grim smile, ""let's go and see what Christine has to tell us.""


Surprise!


Arriving at the hospital, they were met with a great number of reporters, all of whom swarmed around them asking questions and trying to get answers they themselves didn't have yet. Not answering, they just made their way towards the entrance where they could see Christine waiting for them.


 


Greeting the woman, she gave a grim smile before leading them towards the room Happy was in.


 


""We put him in a private room, I didn't think you'd mind, and I know Stark insurance covers that. Anyway, he's alive, but he has more than a few broken bones and tender organs from the blast that pushed him against the wall. Beyond that he has several second, and third degree burn over his body. They are treatable, but we're keeping him in a healing come so he doesn't have too much problems with the pain.""


 


Looking at her friends she added, ""he asked about Pep and the baby when he arrived here. Are they..?""


 


Harry smiled, ""Pepper and Colin are fine, if worried about Happy, but they are just fine. They are spending some time with Remus, Dora and the family.""


 


Christine sighed, ""thank God, I checked on all the other people that got brought in, but I couldn't find a redheaded woman, nor a baby, I am so happy to hear they are fine - or as fine as they can be after what happened.""


 


Harry grimaced, ""she's still in shock, I think, that's why Tony and I came over and checked on Happy instead of Pep, plus she and Colin shouldn't be here now, we've seen the reporters outside, that wouldn't be good for her.""


 


Christine grimaced too, before nodding, ""they started arriving, the moment us was confirmed that Happy was admitted, most likely to catch a glimpse of Pepper or either of you too. Maybe even hoping for the two of you, as after the Battle of New York, neither of you made a statement about that kiss you shared.""


 


Tony just grinned at that, While Harry smiled, ""neither of us felt a reason to tell the whole world more than they already saw. the fact that they all expect us to say something about it, just confirms that they expect things they shouldn't expect from us.""


 


Tony scoffed under his breath, ""reminds me of some other people.""


 


Harry grinned, nodding, ""indeed.""


 


Before turning back to Christine, ""thanks for taking care of Happy, we'll make sure to pop in every now and again, to get an update. I'll also have a SI agent posted here to keep the reporters outside, and to keep an eye out. I don't know what it was, but it looked a bit too much like an assasination attempt in my eyes.""


 


Christine gasped, ""did Pepper?""


 


Tony nodded, ""she told us she saw someone getting ready to blow themselves up. How many casualties are there?""


 


Christine pursed her lips, ""10 right now, but a couple of patients aren't expected to pull through the night, so that might change soon.""


 


Tony and Harry nodded, saying their goodbyes and leaving the hospital, still not saying anything to the reporters still waiting for them like the vultures they are. Neither commented, just let it all slide, and kept on walking - hoping to get back soon to at least let Pepper know Happy was alright and would pull through.


 


As they approached their car however, a woman was standing there, waiting for them. Seeing her made Tony frown.


 


""Maya Hansen.""


 


She nodded, ""Tony... I, I need to show you something.""


 


He tilted an eyebrow, before looking at Harry, the Brit shaking his head minutely, ""make an appointment, I don't have time right now.""


 


With that, they stepped into the car, Tony for once not at the wheel, but on his phone on the passenger's seat, a frown on his face.


 


""I don't think it's a coincidence that Killian shows up, Happy gets hurt and Hansen suddenly shows up again - something has to be linked between all of them.""


 


Harry hummed, ""let's go and take a look then.""


 


With that he took a right towards the apartment building Happy and Pepper had lived in, the police tape standing out against the grey of the buildings. Both of them ducked under the tape to enter the hallway, seeing the point where the explosion must have originated from/


 


Harry hummed as he saw shades on the wall, pointing to the shadows on the wall.


 


""There are only 9 shadows, think one person died on route to the hospital?""


 


Tony tilted his head, ""no... I think... something else is going on here, especially with all these coincidences going on.""


 


Harry frowned, ""we going to look further into Killian then? To see what was going on with that, and see if we can link him with all of this?""


 


Tony nodded, ""I think that is for the best, especially now that I cannot just call in Rhodey, he has his hands full with this whole Manderin issue. Seeing as we haven't been called in, I don't think it's that severe, but still.""


 


Harry frowned a little more, ""Rhodey has an assignment?""



Tony nodded, a little sheepishly, ""he called me a few days ago, saying that normally SHIELD get put on those kinds of jobs, but they haven't been endearing themselves to anyone. Right now as I am aware, they are keeping the agents grounded as much as possible.


 


Especially after it got out that they just sat back and let everyone else do the heavy lifting. Most of the higher ups, as well as the President are keeping them off of major operations, scared what will happen to non-compatents, or non-enhanced, if this is how they act with people meant to be their teammates.""


 


Scoffing Harry only added, ""they deserved that, I wasn't just going to keep all that a secret, no matter that they did indeed help protect the Earth, that does not make them the good guys. Especially when they sat on our couch, drinking out booze, and just waiting until we came up from clean-up. It might not be a great work, but it's part of the deal.""


 


Tony grimaced and nodded, ""if Rhodey hadn't been there, I wouldn't want to think about what would happen to me.""


 


Harry shrugged, ""you'd have fallen to your death, only for Lady Death to put you together again, tried that once, I wouldn't recommend it.""


 


Tony blinked, ""you fell to your dead?""


 


Harry hummed, ""it was me or a friend, I knew I'd survive, or not stay dead, so it wasn't that hard a choice to make.""


 


Tony wined, ""I know what we can do, but don't ever try that again, Green Eyes, I don't think my heart would hold up against that.""


 


Before Harry could give a witty come back, a voice sounded from behind them, ""I would bring you back, My Merchant, your heart would hold out.""


 


Tony pouted, ""I know that, I just never want to see Harry falling to his dead, not if I can help it, Lady Death.""


 


She hummed, ""I understand, I think. Are you still busy?""


 


Both of them gave a nod, ""we need to find out more about these shadows on the walls, and maybe talk to people who saw something similar happen. I want to solve this and find out just who had the great idea of trying to blow up my best friend, taking out other people in the process.""


 


Lady Death hummed, ""you need to visit Rose Hill, Tennessee. Look for the Keener residence.""


 


Harry and Tony blinked, before they looked at the Promordial Being, ""why are you giving away such information, Lady Death?""


 


She hummed again, ""because there is someone in residence there, who My Merchant needs to meet. You'll get what I mean when you meet the boy. Anyway, I also need both of you free to come with me and meet someone.""


 


Tilting an eyebrow, both of them looked at each other, shrugged and followed her back to their car.


 


""Get in, you need to drive to St. Margeret's school for wayward children.""


 


Both of them blinked again, ""you need us to drive to an abandoned boarding school?""


 


Lady Death just smiled, ""it might be abandoned by the nuns and the children, but there are other people occupying the place, my Champion is waiting there for us.""


 


Tony and Harry looked at each other, before they smiled, Death's champion was the one they hadn't met yet, and both of them were curious as to who it was, and what he was capable of.


 


Telling JARVIS where to go, they followed the directions to a building that looked like a church, but seeing as it had once been occupied by nuns, that was somewhat expected. The amount of cars on the parking lot was not though, especially not for a building that had been unoccupied for years.


 


Tony was tapping away on his phone, before he let out a little happy sound, ""it's a mercenary's meeting place, seeing as no one ever wanted to buy this, they did some years ago and made it into a meeting/resting place so they didn't have to meet up in some random bar.""


 


Lady Death grinned, ""indeed, My Champion was one of the first ones here.""


 


This had Tony frowning again, no doubt looking up who it was they would meet here.


 


An aha left him, before he showed Harry a picture of a brown-haired, brown eyed man who was grinning at the camera, ""Wade Wilson, also known as Deadpool, in the community he's known as a mercenary who can't die - he served in the special forces, before he was honourably discharged after he got cancer. Not much is known after, but he popped up again, cancer free, as the mercenary Deadpool who got every job done, always lives at the end of it, and never shows his face.""


 


Harry winced, ""something happened so he wouldn't show his face, he looks pretty, maybe he lost those looks.""


 


Lady Death hummed, so they were on the right track. Looking at Tony, he could see the man was still digging now that he had a name to work with. A hum here and there let him know that the genius was finding little tidbits of information about this Wade person. From the look on Tony's face he was liking what he was finding, which only served to excite Harry too.


 


He knew what kind of personality Lady Death had, so for her to decree this Wade her Champion, it had to be something very special that he did for her.


 


""What did he do?""


 


Lady Death smiled, ""he fell in love with me, when I used an avatar to roam around. He eventually found out, and instead of leaving me, he stayed around, and he did his utmost best to protect me, even after knowing nothing could happen to me.""


 


Harry smiled, ""that sounds like he is quite the softy then.""


 


Tony hummed, ""only for people he liked though, I found a list of his credentials on the dark web, this guy is one of a kind, especially to those that have wronged him. After he got discharged from the army he volunteered for the weapon X program, which in the end was a government funded program to experiment with enhanced individuals, or try and awaken enhanced DNA in non-enhanced.


 


This is what happened to Wade, he was just a great soldier, but the weapon X program awakened his latent enhanced-gene, at the cost of his body however, the way they awakened it almost killed him and was a way for his body to try and make sure that he survived the ordeal.""


 


This had Harry frowning, ""I hope that project got defunct?""


 


Tony hummed again, ""Yeah, Logan and Wade made sure it did.""


 


Nodding and smiling, ""that's good.""


 


Lady Death smiled, ""shall we go inside?""


 


Nodding again, they exited the car, looking around and seeing more than one person gaping as they processed just who was walking past them. Entering the former school, Lady Death guided them to a red clad figure sitting alone at a booth table.


 


""Vanessa, you came back.""


 


Lady Death smiled and pressed a kiss to his covered cheek, ""Hello Wade.""



Harry blinked, ""Vanessa?""


 


Lady Death nodded, ""I was bored at one point, so I had one of the reapers take over, so I could take a break away from everything. I came here, donning a human form, calling myself Vanessa, which was when I found my Champion.""


 


Turning to Wade, she mentioned to Harry and Tony, ""Wade, meet my Merchant and my Master, Tony Stark and Harry Potter-Black. My Merchant, My Master, meet my Champion, Wade Wilson.""


 


The red-clad figure nodded his head, Harry kept getting the impression he was smiling at them, which was something new. Looking around, they could see several people looking at them, most likely not knowing what to think about this meeting.


 


""Wade, they need some help with your... expertise.""


 


This had Tony and Harry blinked, before they remembered what was going on and who they needed to find.


 


""We do, I guess. We need someone to follow, and if what we're guessing...""


 


Just as Harry wanted to continue, Tony's phone started going off, the voice of JARVIS coming out of it, ""Sirs, I made a flight schedule to Rose Hill, Tennessee.""


 


Sighing, they turned to Wade again, ""we need someone shadowed and if what we find is as we fear it to be, we might need someone to...""


 


""Un-alive them?""


 


Tony snorted, but nodded, ""yeah, un-alive him, we don't know for sure, but we think he's linked to all those bombings that don't seem to be bombings, claimed by the mandarin. We don't have a case yet, but some things are too much coincidence to just be happening at random. We have business in Tennessee, but we also need someone to keep an eye on the target. I think that's why... Vanessa introduced us.""


 


Wade hummed, ""alrighty! What's the rate?""


 


Harry looked at Tony, before shrugging, ""what's your normal rate, Wade?""


 


The red-clad man hummed again, ""depends on the assignment, how about $3000 up front and $3000 after the thing is done? $5000 extra if I need to un-alive him.""


 


Tony and Harry shrugged, $6000 didn't sound like such a bad deal when they could leave for Rose Hill, without worrying about Pepper and anyone else Killian would target. They both knew that hiring a killer wasn't a smart move, but who knows what else Killian would do, none of them wanted to think about that.


 


Grabbing his phone, Tony held it up, ""any chance I can wire it?""



Wade shook his head, until Lady Death wrote a bank account down, ""you can wire it to this, it'll get to Wade in the end.""


 


Turning to Wade, she smiled, ""I know you prefer cash, love, but I need them to go to Rose Hill.""


 


Wade just hummed, wrapping an arm around her as he pulled her close, the gesture making Harry smile, ""so that's why he is your favourite.""


 


Wade just shook his head, ""I just proved I didn't care if she was Vanessa, or Lady Death, or whatever, I fell in love with Vanessa and I did a lot of shit to keep her with me, wasn't going to let the whole primordial being thing stop me from loving her.""


 


If they weren't in the bar, Harry might have cooed, especially with the way Lady Death's pale skin lit up with a blush. He remembered when she would tell him about the Merchant and the Champion, at that time they seemed like some far away people he was getting to know through a mutual friend. 


 


But after getting to meet both of them, he realised that Death knew they would all get along just fine, and with her and Wade being some sort of couple, and him and Tony maybe marrying soon, this was the ultimate unity - Thanos wouldn't know what hit him.


 


That thought made him chuckle, the others looking at him, until he shared his thoughts and had all of them laughing. It was indeed something to be seen, just how the Mad Titan would be able to take them on.


 


Wade's phone gave a notification, as he looked at it, he looked at Lady Death after, ""that was fast.""


 


She nodded her head, ""I really need them to get going to Rose Hill soon, there is someone there they need to meet. It happens in all the other universes, so it has to happen in this universe too.""


 


This had all three of them curious, but as usual that was as far as she wanted to spill, Lady Death's eyes twinkled though, so it must be something that forms them in a way that is needed for the future.


 


Pulling out his phone again, Tony typed that they would be out of town for a while, putting the workings of SI, and MI, at a down low, citing that Happy's hospitalisation left them with some things that needed to be arranged. With the reporters at their tail, going down south might be a good thing.


 


Both of them did text Pepper though, to give a follow up on what they had let her know after meeting with Christine about how Happy was. She seemed happy to know she wouldn't lose another man in her life, even if this came on top of the whole Arthur thing.


 


Nodding to Wade once more, both of them smiled as Lady Death made no move to get up with them, it would seem she wanted to catch up. She mentioned them to go, she'd stay with Wade for a while and keep an eye out as well. After all, she liked all of them too much to let anything happen to her favourites.


 


Not only that, but if everything happens as it should, Teddy would soon have a playmate his own age, hopefully joined by another in a few years. As she looked on as her Merchant and her Master left the bar, she had to smile, their lives would soon change, for the better of course.


 


Wade grinned, ""you're arranging something you shouldn't be arranging.""


 


She grinned right back, ""as if I'm one to hold to the rules, that was what you liked about me, wasn't it.""


 


The man grinned, ""that and the fact that you always came back, no matter what, you always come back to me. I like that I can't lose you, after knowing I was immortal, it got depressing rather fast, until I knew I wouldn't be alone for all eternity.""



 



Lady Death smiled as she pressed a kiss to where his lips where, ""you'll never lose me, love, I'll always be there, now, until the end of the universe.""


 


Humming once more, Wade got up, ""let's go look for this Killian guy then.""


 


She grinned, ""already ahead of you, hold on tight then.""


 


As they left the establishment, Lady Death transported them to a mansion in the middle of nowhere, the guard detail however betrayed this wasn't some abandoned house, but a secret base of some kind. Curious, Wade sneaked closer, trying to glimpse inside.


 


---


 


Harry and Tony made their way to the airfield that held the private jet, so they could take that to Rose Hill, as Lady Death had told them they needed to go there. It seemed important if this was a moment in time that came back in every universe. She had told them that certain parts always came back - in every universe.


 


Tony getting kidnapped in Afghanistan, Harry losing his parents young, Obidiah betraying Tony, the confrontations between Voldemort and Harry - these kept coming back, and were as such, moments set in time that not even Lady Death could change.


 


This moment was one of those moments too, even though they didn't know what it would be. Both of them were looking forward to it, though, knowing was nice, but a (nice) surprise now and again was welcome too. It also helped to keep them on their feet, there was a war to be won still, even if it was years away.


 


They had hinted to SHIELD, to Xavier, and to other connections they had that something was coming, something that was going easier now that there had been an alien invasion, even if it was not the same thing as what was still to come.


 


But for now they knew they could only leave hints, prepare the right people, leave notes for the right people and act on those. Have connections all over the place, with other enhanced, with the military, even in other continents - which was a win-win for both MI and SI, as they were worldwide.


 


Taking place on the jet, Tony leant against Harry, ""aren't you curious?""


 


Harry hummed, ""of course I am, but I also worry about Happy, so a surprise might take my mind off things. I also miss Teddy, as he was in class the whole day and he'll have to come home to Pepper in tears. He loves aunt Pepper, so seeing her crying will make him want to join.""


 


Tony hummed, ""do you know if he has any friends his age?""


 


Harry winced, but shook his head, ""he's a smart boy that's been mostly around adults his whole life, he doesn't really bond with people his own age, not even at a school for enhanced sadly enough. 


 


He made some friends with the older kids though, I heard tales of a Bobby, a Marie and a John. So he's not totally alone, although a friend his own age would be great. Or just a few years apart, last I heard the kids he hangs out with are 15 or 16, to his 9.""


 


Tony nodded, ""I had the same problem, that was, until I med Rhodey, who was only 2 years older than him. I wonder what the odds are that we find a kid that would bound with Teddy while in Rose Hill.""


 


Harry blinked, ""are you thinking about adopting?""


 


Tony shrugged, ""who knows, we already know this is something that is going to last, so whose not to say we won't, if we were to find a kid that needs us and that we're connected to.""


 


Harry hummed, resting his head on Tony's, as the other man leant against his shoulder, ""who knows.""


 


---


 


It would seem that it was destiny that they talked it over, as the first person they found in Rose Hill happened to be 10 year old Harley, who could show them to the spot the first bombing had taken place. 


 


Again there was one shadow missing from the report, 7 people would have lost their life there, but only 6 shadows were seen. As Harry noticed that Tony was figuring it out, Harry took Harley aside to ask him where his parents were.


 


This had the kid stopping and staring ahead of him, ""dad went for lottery tickets, I think he must have won, as that was 5 years ago. I used to have a mom and sister, but they died in the bombing, I've been living alone since then, have no more family on Ma's side and Dad's side doesn't want to take me.


 


This backwater town also doesn't know what to do with me, as I'm skipping grades every other year, I wish I could leave but I don't know where I would go.""


 


Looking at Tony, Harry glimpsed back at Harley, ""did you mean what you said when you told us that Tony is your role model?""


 


Harley nodded, ""he's amazing, and I always wanted to be like him, I had hoped to go to New York one day, but I don't think I'll always be stuck here in Rose Hill. No one wants to adopt a teen, especially not one that isn't in the system.""


 


Harry grinned, ""we would. I think Tony thinks you're the best thing in the world already, and I agree, would you like to come home with us, Harley?""


 


The boy's eyes started to twinkle, ""you mean it?""


 


Harry nodded, ""cross my heart, you're wasted here in this backwater town, no offense, and I know we talked about adopting. Plus, you'd have my godson Teddy to interact with when we get home.""


 


While Tony was figuring out the mystery, Harry was filling Harley in on what would be in New York, as well as calling legal to start a custody case for them. Which in the end wasn't necessary, as Rose Hill couldn't wait to give them Harley Keener.


 


Behind the scenes, Lady Death smiled at her favourites, ticking off one name from her list, staring at one more - Peter Parker.


I normally update in the mornings, but I don't think I'll have time tomorrow.So, seeing as it is probably Thursday somewhere in the world (and about 40 minutes away from it here) have the next chapter for between technology, magic and death


Remus pinched the bridge of his nose as he looked at Harry, ""let me get this straight, you went to some backwater town in Tennessee to figure out what happened to Happy, and came back with a kid?""


 


Harry hummed, ""that's the really short version, want to hear a more detailed one?""


 


Remus sighed, ""yes please.""


 


Grinning Harry started telling about the shadows they had seen at Happy and Pepper's apartment, but the shadows - which were people vaporized in the blast - hadn't matched the deadtoll given to the hospital. Which had made them both suspicious.


 


Setting out to find the perpetrator, they were stopped by Lady Death who had given them a hint, telling them they needed to go to Rose Hill to find answers to the questions they had. Luckily, as neither of them had wanted their family to be left all alone, she had taken them to meet the third of her chosen, Her Champion - Wade Wilson, or Deadpool, who had been happy to keep an eye out.


 


With that taken care of, and the meeting with Wade behind them, both Tony and Harry had travelled down to Rose Hill, to find a young boy willing to tell them that there had been a retired veteran living there, who had been taking some kind of substance from a man they now recognized as Aldrich Killian, who was later replaced with someone wearing clothes that showed they worked for AIM - which was Killian's company.


 


Harry sighed, ""Harley, who told us, also told us he lost his mother and sister in the explosion, but as this was such a small city no one could take him in, nor did they want to. Especially since he got along so well with Tony, neither of us could bear to leave him behind - he would have gone mad there, Remus.""


 


Remus sighed too, ""get on with the story first, we'll talk about Harley after, alright?""


 


Harry nodded, before continuing that whatever it was that this other man had given him, had caused the explosion to occur, taking out an entire block with it, as well as everyone in the proximity. The man who had given it to him however, had miraculously managed to get away without as much as a burn wound.


 


Getting permission to search the man's flat hadn't been necessary, as everything had been stored at the police office, even if they had all ruled it as a gas leak - which sounded weird, as most gas explosions didn't get hot enough to disintegrate people.


 


But it also took away them snooping around this guy's possessions, luck would have it that they found registration forms for a test project at AIM, which offered disabled veterans a way to regain their mobility again. As had been the case with this man, as he had lost a leg in Iraq, yet last they saw him, he had two legs again.


 


Tony, having found that piece of info, was digging into AIM and everything they had worked on for the last few years. What he found however, didn't spell out anything good for whoever was in their way. With the way Killian had acted once he knew Tony was still CEO, he guessed that meant him, and everyone closely associated with him - the main reason Happy was now in the hospital.


 


""Tony is looking into all that more and more, also to see who is funding it, and what might be an underlying goal, especially linked to the Mandarin. Nothing about this gives me good vibes, Tony feels the same way, so we are looking into it.""


 


Remus nodded, ""and Harley?""


 


Harry grinned, ""you should have seen them, Remus, we found him on the road going through some trash to have spare parts for his potato launcher he build - also from scraps, all the while he was living alone and living off of whatever he got from his mom's pension and the insurance.


 


But he and Tony hit it right off, so well in fact that I think Tony wouldn't have left without the kid, if I had been against it. 


 


Anyway, we asked around for someone who acted as Harley's guardian, but all we could find was one overworked social worker, who told us that he didn't have one. She didn't have the time to arrange one (which is odd, seeing as it is her job) but also because no one would take him - citing he was too smart for them to handle, or too outspoken to deal with. Remind you of anyone?""


 


Remus sighed, once again, ""he sounds like Tony. Which explains why you wouldn't let the kid stay there, but still. There is a lot going on in recent years, are you sure you're ready for a kid to be involved in this?""


 


Harry shrugged, ""maybe, but I know we'd both feel awful if we had to leave him behind in that dump. Not to mention the social worker almost threw the guardian papers at us, when we passed by her to get everything in order. That town wanted to do everything they could to get rid of him, and that is not something they should be doing to a 10 year old.""


 


Remus shook his head, ""you're right about that, hell, he's about Teddy's age, I can't imagine anyone not looking after my son, should Dora and I die, speaking about that, what about his father?""


 


Harry shook his head, ""ran out about 5 years ago and never looked back at his wife or kids. The mother was an only child whose parents died some years ago too, so Harley didn't have anyone until we came around.""


 


Running a hand over his face, Remus added, ""poor kid.""


 


Harry nodded, ""yeah, and we were sure we'd be able to give him a much better life here, not to mention, Teddy would finally be able to hang around with another child his own age instead of the teens at the institute.""


 


Remus hummed at that, ""you do have a point there, Teddy is also exceptionally bright for his age, yet didn't have the friends I had to counter that a bit. Maybe having Harley around could help in the long run.""


 


Harry grinned, ""I'm sure it will, we're keeping him home from school for a while, to make sure he has adjusted and has had time to process all this, as I don't think he ever allowed himself to take time for that. He was alone suddenly, without any support there.""


 


Remus nodded, ""I understand that, maybe Xavier can take him too, even without a mutation, so he can adjust with people he already knows around him - once the time if right, of course.""


 


Harry nodded, ""I'll talk it over with Tony, how is Pepper doing so far?""


 


--


 


A whole while away, Wade was biting his lip as he saw another truck make its way into the mansion he was looking at, nothing about this seemed to add up - except that something extremely weird was going on.


 


Humming, he pulled out his phone and called Harry, to give out a report and to ask what they needed him to do now. He could just waltz in there and start un-aliving everyone, but he didn't think that would get them very far.


 


Grumbling, he told the other man what was happening, to which he was relieved of staying there in the greens watching the mansion for whatever it was that is going on in there.


 


Harry however told them they were working on a plan to take down whatever was going on there, to just get back to Vanessa, and they'd meet up to close the deal. 


 


Humming, Wade collected his gear and skipped towards the roads a bit further away to call a cab to come and pick him up. Maybe he could get in as the action really took place, it wasn't like he could die or anything like that.


 


--


 


Tony concentrated on his screen as he hacked into AIM's server, trying to find out just where he needed to go to attack their funding. It was one thing to have a mishap while testing someone, or even people dying in a test face for a new kind of drug. But to deliberately use it to harm people was just out of the question.


 


Seeing just who was funding the project, he called Rhodey, someone had to go and warn the president that his vice-president was funding a terrorist.


 


When his best friend didn't answer, and didn't call back within half an hour, Tony knew that something was amiss. Something only added when he got word that someone dressed as War Machine had attacked air force one.


 


Cursing, he called Harry, told him to drop whatever it was he was doing, ask Remus to watch Harley and call Wade that they might need back up. They needed to save the president, and Rhodey.


 


Wade got a notification, just as he saw a car drive away from the mansion, carrying a man he could swear was James Rhodes in the back. Cursing, he made sure to attach himself to the underside of the car - not his favourite mode of transportation, but he needed to be there where the action was.


 


--


 


Harry could only watch as Tony made an effort, and succeeded in getting all of the personnel of Air Force One hanging onto him, making them survive the several thousand foot drop that would have killed them otherwise. Once they were all in the water of the bay, cheering for them and thanking them - he could see police boats closing in to get these people out of the water.


 


Once Tony was standing next to him, he told his lover that Wade had texted that he was following the car that held Rhodey, but couldn't see where they were being taken. Not that it mattered a lot, as soon as Tony heard that, he took out his own phone and hacked into it to see where Wade's GPS was located.


 


Having coordinates, Harry took them there, shocked to be seeing a set up on an oil drill with the president and Rhodey hanging from one of the beams. They could also see Killian and an assorted gathering of people he used whatever he invented on, all of them ready to intervene as soon as they saw someone.


 


Feeling someone approach, they both sighed at seeing it was only Wade, the other man looked sheepish, but nodded at them.


 


""What crazy house have we landed here?""


 


Harry pointed towards Killian, ""blondie over there got stood up by Tony once upon a time, he didn't take it well. Wants to kill the president of the United States to prove a point, most likely. Rhodey is sadly there for collateral damage, and because it will hurt Tony more.


 


From the way he is looking around, he is expecting someone to show up, maybe us, maybe someone else, but we can't take any chances, not with this.""


 


Wade nodded, taking out his katanas, as a gunshot might light the place on fire. Tony held out his hands, coated with parts of the armor. While Harry took out a scythe.


 


Wade gasped, ""so not fair, she gave you a scythe!""


 


Harry smiled, ""it's the elder wand, I needed a weapon once and it changed for me, it's pretty neat.""


 


The mercenary nodded, gushing over it while he looked, Tony however grinned, ""JARVIS, let the boys come out and play.""


 


Harry grinned too, knowing that Tony had entertained himself a lot of nights, when the nightmares got too heavy, with building, and building, all kinds of suits to be used for these situations. They were also to be used in a search and rescue operation, when a human couldn't reach what needed to be reached.


 


Nodding to one another, Wade and Harry took the brunt of the attack, while Tony sneaked the other way to get the President and Rhodey out of harm's way. Killian wouldn't know what hit him, once they launched their own attack.



Tony watched as both Wade and Harry took the brunt of the attack head on, both of them much more in tune with the powers they were granted by Lady Death, plus both of them were enhanced outside of them being a chosen of Lady Death.


 


Sneaking out back, he climbed the structure both Rhodey and the President were hanging from, going to his best friend first of all, as the other man wasn't looking all that well. He was sweating and seemed to be panting from exhaustion.


 


""Platypus, you alright?""


 


Rhodey shook his head, ""injected with something after.... after they took the suit.""


 


Tony frowned, ""something orange?""


 


Rhodey just nodded, making Tony grind his teeth, so it would seem that Rhodey got injected with extremis, most likely as a back up when whatever they were staging here didn't work. Frowning, he cut the army man loose, helping him settle down on one of the bars from the oil drill.


 


""I'm going to cut the President loose now, alright, sour patch, you going to be alright?""


 


Rhodey clutched himself to one of the bars, before nodding, ""I will, go get the President out of here.""


 


Nodding, Tony went and got the president out of his bounds, helping the older man stand and checking him for any injuries that couldn't wait. Finding none, he helped the president down, right as the first of his suits arrived.


 


""Mr. President, I'm getting you home, alright? But I need you to close your eyes as I know you won't be able to fly a suit.""


 


President Ellis swallowed thickly, before nodding, ""I will. Thank you, Mr. Stark.""


 


Nodding, he had one of the search and rescue suits encase the president before it shot off towards the Pentagon, taking the President to safety, where he together with those saved from Air Force One should be able to find those responsible for this, among those his own vice-president.


 


Looking as his suit took the President away, Tony was shaken out of his stupor by Rhodey yelling at him, dodging, he found Killian standing in front of him his skin glowing a very unhealthy orange - most likely the extremis he had developed and injected into himself.


 


Frowning he found that he could dodge the enhanced punches and kicks the man tried to land on him, making him quip something about performance issues. After all, this was someone who turned super villian just because Tony didn't show up for whatever he was invited to. But even then, this mad man had approached him on a new year's party back in the 90's, when he was known to be a heavy drinker and someone who was late to meetings all the time.



Rolling his eyes, he stepped out of range from a punch Killian threw yet again, much to his ire, the hit making contact with the railings Rhodey was still standing on, taking it all down, his best friend with it.


 


Glaring at the man in front of him, Tony glanced around seeing both Harry and Wade fighting the goons Killian had hired - or persuaded to follow him, more than half of them he recognized from the files he found on the AIM website, so much for those honorable discharges for those that willingly aided a terrorist.


 


The way both of them were dancing around them, Harry with a scythe and Wade with his katanas made Tony wonce just a bit, all of those getting a direct hit never got up, making him notice the glow around the katanas and the scythe, so both of them were channeling their Death's gift, making sure these people were getting their dues and were transported, or their souls were transported, to whatever afterlife they believed in.


 


Turning to Killian again, he wanted nothing more than to check on Rhodey, he had seen what Extremis was capable of, but seeing was still something different than believing. If whatever Killian did made him lose his best friend, he wasn't sure what he'd do to the man - well, more than he already planned on doing seeing as he had deliberately organized terrorist attacks and had tried to kill the President.


 


 ""See what I can do, Stark, if you had stayed away, nothing would have happened. So in a way I should thank you for letting me wait in the blistering cold for hours.""


 


Rolling his eyes at that, Tony jumped to the side of the next blow, ""I didn't do anything, you just went mad and decided to try your hand at a different super serum, that's all this is - genetic manipulation of people, which not only made it so they could heal from injuries that normally would kill them, but that also made a them a whole lot more aggressive.""


 


Killian just laughed, ""I made a better human, Stark, one that will be able to regenerate lost limbs, that is stronger, faster and greater than a normal human. I will bring upon the revolution for our troops, there where you failed us as you stopped producing weapons.""


 


Tony rolled his eyes, ""I stopped producing weapons when I got a first hand glimpse at what my weapons in the hands of the enemy meant for our troops. I started concentrating on those that are here after, and on making sure our troops come home safe, from wherever they went to.


 


The fact that you think that by developing the Extremis virus you'll bring something revolutionary to war, is laughable, and a disgrace to every man and woman that ever went out there to serve our country. You're the kind of man that will keep this for the US at first, but the moment someone gives you a better price you'll go there and betray your own country for the money. And let's not start with all the charges you already have with all the things you pulled here.""


 


Killian grinded his teeth, the orange glow coming now from his eyes, as well as all over his body. As he looked, Tony could see the instability of it all, he had guessed that it still had a lot of issues that needed to be resolved, but in this case it might just work in his defence. If he could get Killian to overload, they would be one less trouble to deal with.


 


Gloating and poking fun at whatever he could think off, he could see it working, the Extremis was turning unstable, making different areas of the man light up - and from the look in his eyes he either didn't notice, or didn't care enough to deal with it.


 


While they were making their way through the oil plant, he could see a lot of bodies laying on the deck, most of them not a hair out of place, so touched by the weapons Harry and Wade wielded. 


 


Some, he could see, were slashed clean in half, also Wade's work no doubt, with a few seemingly burnt out as their extremis gave out, the same thing he was trying to get Killian to do, to make sure the mandarin wasn't able to make any more victims. Not that it would bring any of those he already made back.


 


It made him think back about the boy sitting at their home, who had lost his mother and sister in one of these attacks, and who had been tossed aside by everyone else in his town, because he was too smart, quirky and witty for a backwater Tennessee town.


 


Shaking his head, he noticed Harry out of the corner of his eye, supporting Rhodey as they made their way towards him. Both of his favourite men were unharmed, even if Rhodey was still unstable on his legs - most likely still getting used to the changes his body went through.


 


Killian seemed to see both of them too, most likely hating that he had injected Rhodey with a more stable version of extremis, and thus harder to misuse than his own test version. Tony also saw the exact moment Killian dismissed Harry as a civilian, seeing as he went for the Brit's throat with a burning hand.


 


Not that it ever touched him, Harry just looked at the man, an eyebrow tilted, ""really now?""


 


Struggling against the invincible grip someone had on him, the blond seemed to realise he had lost. Even more so when Wade came to stand between Rhodey and Tony, firing his guns into his kneecaps before the same thing that held onto him seemed to suck the extremis out of him.


 


Harry held out his hand for the orange mist, closing around it, making it disappear. Looking at the man now on his knees, legs destroyed, and back to their original state - meaning cripple.


 


""You choose the wrong people to mess with, Mr. Killian, now you pay the price for that. I'm sure the high court, as well as the President, would love to have a word with you, before they lock you up for a very, very long time.""


 


As he said that, a helicopter of the Air Force landed on the oil platform, Rhodey's superior (who had also been in the plane of Air Force One, and who was saved by Tony) came out to support the man, leading him to the aircraft just as Tony yelled at them that he had a way of undoing what it was that they had done to Rhodey.


 


With a mention to JARVIS, the rest of the Suits took off, going back to where they rested on one of the basement floors at the STARK Tower. 


 


Several other soldiers came to take Killian away, before they started working on getting the bodies of those present back to their family, together with the news that these people had been aiding a terrorist all because he gave them their mobility back.


 


Making a call to Pepper, Tony explained what had happened, but that all of them were fine, or were going to be fine, as soon as he managed to extract Extremis from Rhodey. He did however ask her and Remus to look into buying AIM now that Killian was arrested. From what he found they had some interesting ideas that could work with whatever he and Harry thought about in the future.


 


The redhead agreed, and he heard Remus saying the same thing from further away, making both him and Harry happy that they would help people that would be without a job in the next 48 hours, once it was released that Aldrich Killian was the real brain behind the Mandarin.


 


Sighing, he made his way towards the chopper, Wade and Harry at his side. The moment they entered, a tablet was thrust in their hands, the President on the other side, to thank them once again for coming to his rescue. All three of them waved it away, saying they would have done it anyway - for whoever needed it.


 


Which made the President start on explaining he had been looking into SHIELD and other things that had come to light after the invasion in New York, and what he saw didn't comfort him in the least. So he asked Tony and Harry if they would be willing to be his advisors on that, especially as it was no secret both of them did employ, and were friends, with several enhanced.


 


Harry and Tony looked at each other, before nodding, telling the President, they would look into it, and see if any of their friends or acquaintances were interested in becoming a sounding board for the United States, after all, more and more enhanced, superhero, or villain, were coming out of the woodworks and needed a different approach than a baseline human would need.


 


The moment the President thanked them once more, before ending the call, both Harry and Tony had their phones out, texting people around them on what was asked of them and how they would be able to work with this - as it was still a great idea, for all those involved, if enhanced finally got a voice.



Tony hummed as he made his way to the medbay of the army base, holding the cure, or almost cure, for extremis in his hands. With Killian incapacitated and Maya in prison, the people of AIM had legal jurisdiction over everything they had ever made - something they gladly gave to Tony and Harry once they heard they were the reason they still had jobs - only with better benefits this time around.


 


With the original code of extremis, and people who had worked on it before, finding both a cure, and creating a watered down version - which didn't explode on people - was a piece of cake. He did plan on making sure Rhodey had a watered down version in his blood always - if only because he got a feeling they might need it in the future.


 


Nodding to the staff on duty, he approached his best friend on the table, smiling as he presented the tube that would make extremis dormant in his blood.


 


""Sometimes I'm so happy you're a genius, Tones.""


 


Tony just grinned, ""I'm just happy I had this roommate in MIT that kept with me all through the years. This is the least I could do for you, after everything you did for me, Rhodey.""


 


The airman grinned at that, before counting back from 10 as the mask was placed over his face, ready to get rid of this thing they had infected him with, but agreeing with Tony that a watered down version was their best bet after everything that was looming on the horizon.


 


Harry meanwhile, had gone back to NYC, to check in with the family, and to console their adopted son that they were both alright.


 


Harley had gotten quite a scare after both Tony and Harry left late at night, to save Warmachine, and had accidentally seen the footage Killian had spread in an attempt to broadcast the abilities of Extremis.


 


All he ended up doing was show the world that Harry Black and Tony Stark were much more than they appeared to be, even if they used those abilities for the greater good. 


 


Communities all over the world were speculating that the both of them were enhanced, but had hid it, to make sure they had a power base before coming out with that tidbit of information on themselves (quite the achievement, especially with how many cameras Tony had on him ever since he was a child.)


 


But in these rumours flying around, they had accomplished another thing, the enhanced community was trusting them more than they already had. After all, most of them had someone in their family or friend groups that worked at either of their companies, or knew someone that works there and who had all sung praises to their employers.


 


The fact that those same employers now also seemed to be enhanced themselves, spoke to them, and opened lines of communications not possible before. Plus the fact that they seemed to be able to work with Deadpool, who was notorious for being difficult, only added to the bonuses and let other 'outcasts' know that these two wouldn't judge based on appearance, special powers or background.



With that in mind, and with the fact that the president had asked them for help in managing the enhanced community, especially now that they were coming more and more in the open, both of them were more than willing to play the enhanced card if it got them the connections they needed, as well as the people they needed.


 


But back to Harley, the 10 year old had seen the footage, and had feared that his new dads would end up like his mother and sister, triggering a major breakdown, that had Remus calling Harry the moment it happened. 


 


Harry was glad he did, as he didn't want Harley to be traumatised, or more than he already was, because of this. They had gotten the boy out of a toxic environment, no need to get him back into one because they didn't deal with all the PTSD the young boy obviously still had from what happened with his parents and sister.


 


So, they got the number of a psychologist specialising in children, and made an appointment with her, to see what it was they needed to do to support Harley in these troubling times.


 


As soon as he ended the call to Dr. Sweets, he noticed Lady Death standing close to him, grinning at what she most likely foresaw.


 


""A part of me just doesn't want to know, Vanessa.""


 


She just grinned, pressed a kiss to his cheek and was off to most likely find Wade. Ever since they found out about her human identity, they could find her around them a lot more. Either with Wade, alone, or just visiting them - happy to not always be donning the mantle of Death around her chosen.


 


It had been a rough couple of weeks since the whole showdown with Killian but they were all home, even Rhodey, and even cured, the man had gotten off a month to rest after everything his body had to go through. Plus it helped when the President of the United States called your bosses to let you have some time off.


 


Harry sighed as he relaxed on the couch, Harley sitting in between him and Tony, cuddling up to the genius, who was talking to his best friend who had taken to staying with them.


 


Harry in the meantime was keeping an eye on Happy, the man had woken up from his coma a week after the whole mess with Killian and was released from the hospital by Christine. The medical staff of the Tower kept an eye on him in the meantime, but apart from broken bones and a lot of bruises, he was fine, and enjoying life with his wife and son.


 


Pepper, after he got home, had another breakdown, she had feared having to say goodbye to him as she had to do to Colin, her first fiance, who had been crushed when a wall fell upon him after spells made it topple over. It had taken days before they had found him, or found his body, which had left a lasting impression of Pepper.


 


Turning the TV on, he blinked once, before looking at the people around him and asking, ""I can't be the only one who saw that, right?""


 


The whole room shook their heads, ""no you weren't.""


 


As they said that, Harry groaned, ""but I don't want to go back to England.""


 


Pepper stood, ""then don't go, I expect Thor to appear here anyway. You all parted on great terms after the invasion, especially since you managed to free Loki from whatever was controlling him.""


 


---


 


As the redhead had predicted, Thor and Loki did appear at the tower, not long after everything. Jane Foster and her assistant Darcy in tow, the scientist looking worse to wear.


 


""My friends, I had hoped to be seeing you in better times, but alas.""


 


Loki just rolled his eyes, before coming to stand next to Harry, ""we need help with something. Ms. Foster appeared to have fused with the reality stone, No idea how she managed to get in touch with it even, but it's the reason why we appeared all over Midgard.""


 


Harry hummed, ""that makes an awful lot of infinity stones in close range, doesn't it.""


 


Loki nodded, ""it does, this makes three, between space, mind and reality. Discounting one that should also be here in Midgard if the old texts are right.""


 


Harry grumbled, ""this can't be a coincidence, I am assuming this means it's all coming to a close. Soon He will be here, for all we know.""


 


Tony appeared behind him, wrapping his arms around the taller man and humming, ""no thinking dark thought, love. We have the approval of the President to do whatever we think is necessary to deal with anything from enhanced in a humane manner, to any new alien treat.


 


We have that meeting with Charles next week, and if everything goes alright, Erik will be there too, giving us the two greatest groups of the enhanced community here in the US on our side. We can work with this, even if there are infinity stones popping up everywhere.""


 


Harry sighed, ""I hate it when you're right.""


 


Tony just grinned wider, ""well then, we should also take this time to establish an alliance with Asgard's princes, to have help of the extra terrestrial kind, should we ever need it. After all, Thor will be king one day, that may be a great start to plans for the future.""


 


Harry nodded, ""you do have a point, I'll have a talk with Loki about it, seeing as Thor is preoccupied with the kids, and you look like you want to talk to Rhodey.""


 


Tony grinned sheepishly, even if Rhodey had been living with them for a week already, neither of them had the time to spend time with each other like they used to do, especially now that Rhodey didn't need to get back to base in a fortnight


 


Harry just shooed his lover away, grinning at Rhodey as the man looked his way, the Brit winking at the airman to let him know to have fun while they went out. He would stay in the apartment, keeping an eye on the kids, while talking to Loki about whatever was going on in the world and how Midgard and Asgard could possibly be of help in the future.


 


Harry found himself perplexed at the knowledge that Loki was reinstated after everything that had happened, and that Odin had believed them when told about the Mad Titan. It had opened communications on what had happened before, and mended old hurts in a way that might not have been the case had it been different.


 


The feeling he got, that he associated with Lady Death, did indeed let him know that it would have gone very differently had he not been there to snap Loki out of whatever spell Thanos or his minions had the God under.


 


""I have it on good authority however that Odin won't be living for much longer.""


 


This had Harry blinking, ""your mother?""


 


Loki nodded, ""Thor doesn't know yet, but she confided in me that his bouts of the Odin sleep have been lasting longer and longer, there will be a time in the distant future when he won't wake up from it.""


 


""Does this bother you?""


 


Loki hummed, ""a bit, especially since we did mend some old hurts, others won't be able to be mended, but in recent years, he had proven to be the father that I needed. I will miss him, should he pass.""


 


Harry patted his hand, ""if it's of any comfort I know that Lady Death will make sure he gets to Valhalla. I don't imagine he will go out quietly in his sleep.""


 


Loki shook his head, ""no I don't see him doing so either, he'll go and find a fight to go out in a blaze of glory rather than pass in the comfort of his bed.""


 


Loki looked at his brother, ""but with Thor as king, we can start making preparations Odin would never agree with. Not only that, but I don't think he'd ever come to the aid of Midgard, even after everything we told him.""


 


Harry sighed, ""from what I heard about Odin, he was quite the war monger in his younger years. Even now in peace times, I didn't get the idea that he oversees anything other than Asgard, even if he pretends to rule over the 9 realms.""


 


Loki shrugged, ""he thinks we're more sophisticated than the other realms, but where we stagnated after the conquering of the other 8 realms, the other realms took the time to evolve in their own ways. It is quite refreshing to see, that it seems only Asgard stagnated, the others did not.


 


If Odin lives long enough, that might just become his downfall. After all, with recent developments, I know Midgard is going to be the centre of whatever alliance you and Tony establish against the Mad Titan, and I for one want to be here to see it.""


 


Luckily, with Harry and Tony looking for a solution, they were able to extract the realty stone from Jane without any consequences. And while they were doing that, and keeping her safe in the tower, Thor and Loki were able to go back to Asgard to fight off an invasion of Dark Elves who came looking for the Stone.


 


In doing so, and making sure neither of the Princes were preoccupied, they were able to put a stop to the invading forces, before any real casualties were made.


 


Lady Death had whispered in their ears that protecting Jane was in their best interests, as if she was on Asgard, Queen Frigga would die at the hands of the invading forces, or she had in multiple other universes. She did hold a soft spot for the Queen however, and confided in Tony and Harry how happy she was that the Queen would live a much longer life.


 


Looking at the liquid ether however, had Harry and Tony thinking once more that this amount of Infinity Stones that had crossed their path wasn't just a coincidence. Not only that, but ever since she told them about their significance, and their future, Tony and Harry had been on the lookout for these things, but this made 4 in only a number of years.


 


---


 


Six months passed, without the appearance of an infinity stone, luckily, in which Thor and Loki visited them at the tower, or at least dropped in after the blond went and visited Jane in her SI and MI funded lab in New York.


 


All four of them, with the occasional appearance of Wade, had been brainstorming on what to do with the infinity stones now. The tesseract was safely in the vault back on Asgard, while the mind stone had been given to the collector, an entity in space who was known to be eccentric, but extremely possessive of the things that he was given to collect.


 


All that remained was deciding what to do with the reality stone, as they didn't want to put two Stones too close together, so both Asgard and the Collector wasn't an option. But neither was keeping it on Earth, as there were rumours of a hidden civilisation that took care of the Mind Stone. 


 


They needed a place to hide the stone, which could be on Earth, but far enough that it and the Time Stone wouldn't get in touch with one another.


 


Pepper, who had been visiting, came with the answer; ""Gringotts.""


 


Harry blinked a few times, before smiling widely, ""of course, the goblins would never give it up without a fight, plus, we don't even know if Thanos knows anything about the secret societies that roam the Earth, it would be perfect.""


 


Pepper smiled, ""I planned on going to England soon anyway, as soon as it's safe to fly with Colin. I can drop it off if you'd like.""


 


Harry tilted his head, ""you're going to England?""


 


Pepper nodded, ""after everything that happened with Killian, it made me realise that family is still important. I will never forgive my mother for what she did, nor do I think I'll be able to forgive my father for standing by her. But he's still my father, so the least I could do is give him a chance to explain himself.


 


And if I don't like what it is he says, I can still just come back and live my life here, without him interfering. But I need to go, and I want to see my siblings again, get a chance to introduce Colin to his aunts, uncles and cousins.""


 


Harry nodded, looking around and seeing the others also nodding, agreeing with the plan to store the Reality Stone in a vault at Gringotts, away from the world almost - making it all the harder for Thanos to get to it, when he inevitable arrived, to get to all the stones and use this unreal plan of him to try and get into the good graces of Lady Death (not that he would ever be able to).


 


He would find that his plan on winning her heart was a moot plan, as one - reducing all life in the universe by half was in no way a gift to her, nor was it a way into her heart, even if said heart hadn't already been given away.


 


With that part taken care off, they were ready to prepare for more meetings with either groups they knew that held enhanced - such as the X-men and the Brotherhood, or people who had reached out to them through all kinds of means, to let them know they wanted to help with whatever was going to happen in the future.


 


The invasion of New York just over a year ago, had shown people that they were not alone in the universe, and who was to say people like that weren't going to try again, this was their planet and they planned on being there to protect it.


 


With everything going as smoothly, especially after the first talks with Charles and Erik, closely followed by the Fantastic Four, they had been giving the President great feedback on how their strategy was forming, and how Earth would have a first line of defence, that wasn't SHIELD's Avengers, if such a think reoccurred.


 


Speaking about SHIELD, the IT department, and some reliable ethical hackers had been more than happy to help Tony figure out just what was going on behind the scenes. Especially after what Pepper and Remus found out about SHIELD being drenched in HYDRA, making it difficult to establish where the government organisation ended, and the terrorist organisation began.


 


The more that was uncovered, the more they felt like SHIELD had been a cover for HYDRA all along, which explained why neither Tony, nor Harry, had felt comfortable working with the group (of course not made any easier with the way they treated the both of them, or tried to get an in into either companies, for the soul purpose of keeping an eye on them).


 


With the president, and his advisors, taking care of their emergency plan on an international level, namely by running it by the UN, Tony and Harry were free to make sure they screened everyone who volunteered once word got out they were trying to compile a group of enhanced that would be Earth's first line of defence against something like New York.


 


Even more so, when everyone found out just how the Avengers worked, and how bad their team dynamic was. Half the world having seen how Tony risked his life getting a bomb out of New York, only for the people actually of SHIELD and getting paid for solving crises like this had been sitting on his couch after closing a portal he went through to save them all.

sitting in their shared office in the tower, Tony looked at Harry, his lip worried between his teeth, ""do you think everything is alright with Pepper?""


 


Harry hummed and looked up, ""I am quite sure she is, love, if not, we would have gotten word. Try not to worry too much.""


 


Tony whined, ""but I don't know where she is, this is Pepper, Harry! She takes care of everything you don't, I can not live without her, or without you of course.""


 


Harry snorted, ""I noticed, in fact I think we all noticed, you don't even know your social security number, Pepper and I do, you'd be totally lost without us.""


 


Tony just nodded, ""I know! Which is why I don't like my best friend being on the other side of the world, in a community that only recently discovered electronics (and really what is up with that) not able to help her should she need it.""


 


Harry snorted, ""Tones, she's accompanied by her 5 very protective brothers, their families and her own husband, she will be fine!""


 


Tony's pouting was interrupted when there was a knock on the door, revealing HArley on the other side, a small smile on his face.


 


""Hi Kiddo, how was your talk with Dr. Sweets?""


 


Harley shrugged, ""it was okay, we had a bit of a group's session with other children from around, to see if we could make friends, giving us someone else close by we can talk to.""


 


""Was that what they said?""


 


Harley shook his head, ""no, but it's what I and Peter thought up when they paired us together.""


 


Harry and Tony looked at each other, before looking at Harley, ""Peter?""


 


Their adopted son nodded, ""yeah, Peter Parker, he's a kid from Queens, he comes to therapy every other week, to deal with the loss of his parents at a young age. He lives with his aunt and uncle, I think he's my friend?""


 


Harry blinked, ""you think he's your friend?""


 


Harley nodded, ""he's kind of shy, and I think kids pick on him. But he's really nice and smart! Plus he lives nearby, making it easy to meet up outside of therapy. If that's alright with you guys, if we meet up that is.""


 


Harry and Tony grinned at each other again, ""they had feared that Harley would only have Teddy to bond with here, as there were no other children close by. However, Teddy attended Xavier's school for gifted youngsters, who wouldn't take Harley - no matter how smart he was - to adhere to their own policies.


 


But Teddy wasn't here all the time, so to hear that the kid had found someone else, who lived close by, who he liked, was a relief. One they were more than open to, to stimulate.


 


""Do you have a phone number of Peter's guardians, then, Haryely? We can call and schedule a meet up outside of Dr. Sweets office.""


 


Harley nodded, giving them a piece of paper with a number on it, the handwriting suggested it was most likely written down by Peter's aunt May. Taking the slip of paper, Harry wiped out his phone and dialed the number, being very pleasantly surprised by the woman who picked up the phone, who seemed as relieved as they were that their respectable charge was finding someone to make friends with.


 


She also thanked him for calling, agreeing on a playdate in the park the following week.


 


As Harry told this to Harley, the pre-teen beamed up at his guardians, making Tony and Harry once more glad they had taken the boy away from Rose Hill, where he would never get the same chances he would get here in New York City.


 


---


 


In the IT department of SI, a series of codes were appearing on the internet of all things, when they started to make sense, they called up Tony, asking the genius to come down as soon as possible.


 


Tony, hearing the urgency in the voice of Sylvester, he appeared in the office within a few minutes, taking a seat next to the man and looking over what he was seeing, taking over the keyboard from the man and typing frantically as he tried to override what he was seeing.


 


Managing to put a stop to the uploading, he alerted JARVIS, ""J, send out all the suits we can miss, you have a list, start the extraction. Call up Rhodey and have him held, and put out a notification to the members of the still unnamed rescue team, we need to get these people out!""


 


Running back upstairs, he told Harley to go to Remus' apartment, ""Harry, we need to get to DC, right now. SHIELD had the great idea of exposing HYDRA along with themselves, I managed to put a stop to the uploading of the data to the internet - but don't know who already saw.


 


Rhodey, the suits and the team are looking into extracting everyone. 


 


We however need to get to DC, to stop 3 helicarriers from falling out of the sky. I don't want to think about the casualties that will bring with it.""


 


Harry gaped, but nodded, telling Tony to at least get a suit with him, just in case. As soon as he had that, he apparated them to DC, hoping to find the person responsible for this, how stupid could one get.


 


---


 


Down in DC, a blond, redhead and former army pilot felt a shudder run through them, they ignored it, they had done what was best for the US, nothing else could have been done. HYDRA had to be exposed.


SURPRISE!


Tony cursed as they landed after Harry apparated them, looking around at the sky in DC, seeing three helicarriers descending onto the city, meaning they didn't have a lot of time to slow their descent, so at least the people on the streets had a way to get out of there.


 


Harry had approached the nearest officer and explained they needed to clear the city as soon as they were able, they would do anything in their power to keep these in the air until the ground under them was cleared.


 


As he saw the officer relaying that info to all units around them, Harry gave a sight, ""Tones, suit up, see if you can't get people out of here faster, I'll keep these birds from touching the ground.""


 


Seeing one of the newer suits stretching out over Tony's body, Harry swallowed thickly before holding out his hands above him. Mumbling the incantation 'aresto momentum' three times and feeling it every time the helicarrier took to the spell and slowed down to a stop.


 


Sweat began piling on his forehead as soon after, all the engines shut off, meaning he was carrying the weight of three carriers with his magic alone, and it was taking its toll. But he would stand firm, Washington DC was one of the largest cities of the USA, he couldn't let these three aircrafts crash - as the number of civilian casualties would be immense.


 


---



Tony meanwhile was helping officers in getting civilians out of the danger zone, carrying several people with the armor, or even picking up a car and flying it out there when it wouldn't start anymore.


 


He knew they needed to work fast. He could see that Harry had managed to stop their descent, but with their engines failing, he knew his lover was the only thing keeping these birds up in the sky. The moment Harry tapped out, they would come tumbling out of the sky anyway.


 


Biting his lip in the privacy of the mask, a notification from JARVIS popped up, letting him know that the internet had been sweeped for all the data from the leak, which had been stored on the SI hard drive, for him, and anyone else to go over. They could decide which information was relevant for the military or the police to see, and which ones could be kept a secret for everyone but themselves and the president, with his counsel.


 


Contrary to what others might think, they wanted a clean operation, and didn't want to use the permission the President had given them, to start doing their own thing, turning into something like SHIELD had turned into - as he didn't doubt that they were behind all this. Which was just a shame, that they had to dig an even deeper hole for themselves after everything that had already happened.


 


Sending a voice message back to JARVIS, to get Remus, and some of their mutual IT guys to start going over the data, categorising it into important, not important and life threatening. Making it easier for him and Harry to figure out what they needed to show the President, and a bunch of other people.


 


He kept turning back to where the helicarriers were still suspended in the air, feeling helpless as he drifted further and further away from where Harry was, if anything went wrong he wouldn't be back there in time to help.


 


A new notification popped up, telling him that Rhodey had gotten the last of the compromised agents out, settling them, and any family they might have, in one of the properties owned by either Tony or Harry - and while Tony had some, even abroad, it was Harry that had a property in almost every country around the world.


 


Rhodey also added that he was on route to DC, to help out in any way he could.


 


---


 


Meanwhile back with Harry, the Brit was starting to feel the weight of these aircrafts pushing down on him, but he wouldn't relent, not with this many lives at risk.


 


What he didn't know however, was that a teen standing nearby had been filming everything, streaming it onto Facebook, where it was quite picked up - even by news outlets and distributed around America.


 


Several groups could only gasp at what was happening, and how one man was making sure that these things weren't falling out of the sky, and keeping what was essentially one of the biggest cities of America safe from all harm that would otherwise befall upon it.


 


But they could also see that it was taking its toll on him, sweat was streaming down his face and neck, his arms bulged with the power he was using, as well with the weight that was no doubt pressing back onto him - he could feel his spells slipping, but wasn't able to renew them, in fear of one of the three getting released from the spell entirely.


 


Widening his stance, he could only hope he would hold out long enough. He could see the Iron Man Armor way down the skyline, knowing that if he let go now, Tony would never make it back in time. And even if he did, the armor wasn't able to keep three helicarriers in the air. He had to do this, he had to make sure they stayed into the air.


 


People all around the United States tried to find a way to get to DC, to help the men that had already proven to do so much for this country and their enhanced community, the least they could do was help out when their country was in need and it seemed Tony Stark and Harry Potter-Black wouldn't be enough.


 


Feeling the one farthest away from his slip from his grasp, Harry gasped, hoping that everyone was cleared out there. 


 


Only for it to never touch the ground and a familiar voice getting through to his mind.


 


""Erik got that one, Harry, if you could let go of the one to the right, Jean, Rouge and I will take over that one.""


 


Sighing, he did as asked, feeling the load lighten as he only had to keep one bird up in the sky, the other two getting carried by others that were able to keep it up. Taking a breather, he tapped the communicator that linked him to Tony.


 


""Only holding one bird up now, love, Charles and Erik came, and brought back-up.""


 


Tony's chuckle was heard from the other side, ""I figured, Kurt, Kitty, Wanda and Pietro showed up here, helping clear the streets and the buildings. I also saw a jet overhead, so those less mobile, like the hospital and nursery home are getting transported out of the way like that.""


 


Harry sighed in relief, ""do you have an idea how much longer this will take?""


 


Tony hummed, ""we should be nearing the end of the danger zone, so give us about 10 more minutes, before putting these birds down gently.""


 


Harry laughed, ""will do.""


 


Reaching out with his mind, he found the connection with Charles again, and relayed the message to the telepath, trusting him to tell Erik, Rogue and Jean the same thing.


 


10 minutes passed, meaning they all maneuvered the birds towards an open space, be it a street, or a park, or even a sports field, and put them down. Keeping the doors locked to be able to apprehend and question each and every person on board - HYDRA personnel wouldn't stand a chance at escaping, and SHIELD personnel would probably be happy to know that their colleagues and family were safe and sound.


 


Looking around though, as soon as they had landed the aircrafts, Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes at Stars and Stripes, Romanov, and an unknown man making their way towards him. The blond at the front with a grim look on his face.


 


""Potter, what are you doing here? We had this under control.""


 


Harry blinked, ""control? You call three birds falling out of the sky, on top of one of the largest cities of the US, under control? Don't make me laugh, Rogers, you just want the credit that isn't due to you.""


 


He could hear the other's teeth grind as he bit down, ""these planes all have HYDRA personnel on them, who cares if they die!?""


 


Harry blinked again, ""seriously, Rogers, even if that is so, there is such a thing as blackmail, or coercion, meaning not all of these men and women are doing this willingly. Plus there was still a whole city beneath them, or don't you care about civilian casualties?""


 


He could see the blond opening his mouth again, only for Romanov to slap her hand in front of it, a sweet smile in her lips, looking around, prompting Harry to do the same, seeing multiple people standing there, horror on their faces, as they hold their phones out - no doubt having recorded what Captain America had said, and insinuated.



Rogers seemed to be seeing the same thing as his cheeks turned red in embarrassment, the man with them however, was looking at something in the sky. 


 


Harry looked up too, and was happy to see Tony and Rhodey touching down. Both men exiting their suits, and making their way to Harry at a brisk pace. Both of them looked at the unidentified man next to Romanov.


 


""Airman Wilson, last I checked you were ordered to turn in those wings when you resigned at the airforce. Repurposing them for your own gain is a felony, not to mention, theft of those attributes from a Stark Industries facility.""


 


The man, Wilson, seemed properly chassied, looking down with a look in his eyes that told them all that he was slowly coming to terms with what he did. Theft alone was a charge, especially if Tony Stark was involved, and repurposing airman material after he resigned was against regulations and would get him court martialed.


 


Rogers on the other hand, didn't seem to get this, as the moment Romanov removed her hand, he started a monologue of how they were doing all this for the greater good. Forgetting once again that cameras were pointing at him. All the while he insinuated, that his way had been the best, they had done what was best for the American people (even if Harry and Tony hadn't interfered a lot of civilian lives would have been lost) and berating them for telling Sam off like that, when he was only doing what was just.


 


Tony and Rhodey snorted, looked at each other, before looking back at the man, ""and you actually believe that? No one is above the law, Rogers, not even someone who follows your every move. In the 40s behavior like this might be tolerated, as war lets people make different decisions.


 


Now, on the other hand, all three of you can expect a court martial, as well as a law suit from the people who might have died here because of your reckless behavior, and the people we went out of out way to rescue after you were stupid enough to upload all the information on SHIELD servers online.""


 


Turning to Romanov, Tony adds, ""Clint says hi by the way, and asks me to tell you he will shoot you the next time you come close to his family again. They're all fine by the way, no thanks to you.""


 


With that he turns away, as army officers rush to apprehend Rogers, Wilson and Romanov, before asking Erik to kindly open the door for them, so they could get to every person inside the aircrafts and take them away one by one. It would be quite the assignment, but after everything that happened, they needed to make sure there were no agents that slipped the nets and restarted HYDRA elsewhere.


 


As soon as that was over, Tony reached out and caught Harry as his legs gave out, ""I think I overdid it a bit.""


 


Making the genius snort, ""you think? J, take the suits home will you? Rhodey and I are going to make sure Harry doesn't overexert himself.""



Both men waited until their suits turned on and deployed back towards the Stark Tower, before wrapping Harry's arms around their shoulder and leading them towards the X-men and Magneto, asking Jean to check out the Brit, who was looking more exhausted by the minute.


 


The last thing he heard was Jean proclaiming he was just tired, to let him rest. They'd give them a ride home with the Jet.



Clint had no idea what was happening, one moment he was on the farm having lunch with his family. The next, an armed vehicle was making its way on his property, the gear it carried letting the archer know it wasn't here for any talks.


 


Swallowing thickly, he looked at Laura, his wife ex-SHIELD agent that she had recognized, exchanging terrified looks as they looked over their two children, not knowing what it was they could do right now.


 


The only way off, that they could take with two children, was to bring them right past the vehicle that was stationed there, the moment it saw movement, it would shoot.


 


Biting his lip, he went and stood at the window, glancing out every few minutes, secretly happy that the people inside hadn't fired yet. Although he had no idea what they were waiting for.


 


When it began shooting however he hit the ground, pulling Lila, who had been standing next to him down too, holding her against his chest even if he knew that if the bullets penetrated the house there wouldn't be a lot he could do to protect her.


 


In the kitchen, Laura had done the same with Cooper, their eyes met, thinking that this would be the last moment they had as a family. When the shooting stopped, topped off with one huge explosion - before the roof collapsed and Iron Man flew in.


 


Clint blinked, ""Tony?""


 


The suit looked at him, before the voice of JARVIS came out, ""I'm afraid not Mr. Barton, Sir is busy controlling the situation in DC, Colonel Rhodes and I are extracting all the compromised agents, with the leak of data on the internet.""


 


""A Data leak? Just like that?""


 


The suit's head nodded, ""someone found it necessary to release all of SHIELD's data onto the internet, to make people aware that HYDRA had infiltrated and was taking over. Those same people seemed to be of the opinion that crashing three helicarriers on downtown DC would be a great idea too - that's the situation Sir and Mr. Potter are dealing with right now.""


 


Clint could only gape, before he sneered, ""Romanov.""


 


Laura blinked, ""what does Nat have to do with all this.""


 


Clint sighed, ""she called me a few days ago, asking me if I didn't feel up to take part in one last mission, to lay out all the dirty secrets to the world. I thought she meant something with whatever political scheme that was going on. I never expected this to happen, least of all from her.""


 


Looking at JARVIS, he asked, ""what about the others, for there are more retired agents like me, as well as some who are very deeply undercover.""


 


JARVIS didn't answer immediately, ""I can not say at this moment, there are too many variables, but for now the statistics show that over 90% of those who were on file are safe, or are being saved as we speak.""


 


Clint clenched his hand, thinking about all those that won't be making it out of this situation alive, all because of whatever Romanov, and maybe Rogers, had gotten into their heads. He had chosen to retire after New York, for the soul purpose of not being around the blond any longer than necessary. And he was proven right, right now, seeing as he and Nat were willing to kill off a lot of SHIELD's personnel, and for what.


 


""Hey JARVIS, can you get a message to Tony?""


 


The head nodded again, ""tell him I never want to see Romanov again, and for her to stay away from my family after everything is done.""


 


JARVIS confirmed, and let the archer know when Tony received the message, ""Sir is asking me to bring you to New York, if you and your wife agree. There are still several more apartments in the tower that are not being used, so you'd be able to settle there. But he'd also like someone he at least knows in passing to help him sort through all the mess that is being left behind.""


 


Looking at Laura, his wife nodded, before she rushed upstairs to pack them essentials before they got out of there.


 


JARVIS meanwhile told them he'd guard them until they arrived at a quinjet not too far from here, who would bring them to New York.


 


---


 


Harry, Tony and Rhodey sighed as they were finally released from FBI custody. The three of them had recounted everything they had done, found and assumed - as well as given the head of investigations the details of what they had been allowed to do by the president.


 


No consequences would befall them, not like Romanov, Rogers and Wilson, seeing as those three had acted without any proper orders. Even if they tried to let everyone know Nick Fury had asked this of them.


 


Only for the Feds to tell them that according to them, Nick Fury was dead because of a suicide bombing. 


 


Harry and Tony however, doubted the man was actually dead, and might have told them to expose HYDRA, but even if they didn't like the man, they refused to believe he would have wanted the majority of his agents killed or compromised - in the way that Romanov had done.


 


Tony and Rhodey would take back the suits to New York, while Harry would get a ride back with the X-men, and Erik, who had all been questioned as well. But were able to show the right amount of paperwork, that they were members of whatever team Harry and Tony were putting together. As such, after asking for their accounts of what happened, they were all free to go.


 


Harry sighed as he took a seat in the jet, groaning as his back started to hurt from all the tension it had, holding up 3 large aircrafts wasn't an easy feat, not even for someone like him.


 


Erik was looking at him, from where the man was sitting next to him, ""you are quite extraordinary, Lord Potter.""


 


Harry just hummed, ""I've been told that before, but what makes you say it.""


 


Erik tilted his head, ""because you caught those birds without any regard to your own safety. Had people not known who you were, both because of your company or your relationship with Dr. Stark, they might have begun shooting at you.""


 


Harry shrugged, ""lives through more, so I'm sure I'll be fine.""


 


Erik sighed, ""still, you also allowed our help the moment we arrived, I had not expected that.""


 


Harry opened his closed eyes to look at the enhanced next to him, ""and why is that?""


 


Kurt was the one who answered, ""because most people didn't trust us before, but now, with the superheroes going around, and you and Dr. Stark letting the world know you are enhanced too, the people are changing their views.""


 


Most of the enhanced with them nodded, all of them most likely having experienced the stigma of being an enhanced, especially Kurt - who didn't look human with his almost devil like appearance, blue skin and hair and bright yellow eyes.


 


Harry shrugged again, ""this is your world too, and after New York and the invasion of it, we're going to need everyone who is willing and capable to be ready.""


 


Charles hummed, ""you've been telling us that for a while now. Any particular reason?""


 


Harry sighed, ""because Tony saw a whole armade in space, when he went through the wormhole. It isn't the question of if we're going to be invaded again, but when - we discussed this with the president, and he gave us leave to start looking for a way to if not prevent it, at least to prepare for it.


 


We're well aware there are a lot of enhanced out there, some in hiding, and some maybe not even knowing what it is they are. Or like certain of us, not yet reaching that potential to unleash it. If we can assure those people that being different is alright, and they aren't the only ones in the world. And showing others that enhanced aren't always the villains, we're working towards a very different society then the one it was before.""


 


The rest of the flight, they changed the topic to more pleasant subject, such as how Teddy was doing in the school, and how all the children were adapting to being in a school of mutants, instead of a normal high school, were there would have been complications in the long run (as normal teachers weren't equipped in dealing with enhanced students).


 


---


 


Once back in the tower, and after saying their goodbyes to the X-men, and parts of the Brotherhood, promising to come by again soon for tea. Harry and Tony just let out one big sigh.


 


""How did we do?""


 


Tony grimaced, ""retrieval of 95% of the people mentioned in the files, with them being undercover, stationed somewhere or retired. 5% were retrieved in a body bag.


 


Of the active personnel it would seem that only about 15% of them was an active and willing HYDRA operative, with the others either having no idea, or being blackmailed or coerced into doing what they did. The feds are taking over that part, going through every one of the people on those carriers and making the call if they were HYDRA, and if so, willingly, or if they were just not aware of what was happening.""


 


As Harry opened his mouth, Vanesse walked in, accompanied by Wade, a sad smile on her face, ""they are all with me, and at peace now. Their passing wasn't pleasant, but I was able to keep their suffering to a minimum.""


 


Wade however pressed himself against Harry's side, the two of them at the same height, ""I'm hurt you didn't ask for my help, Harrikins.""


 


Harry rolled his eyes, ""that's because we needed all of those involved to live to interrogation Wade, plus, as far as I know you don't have a mutation that would have helped us evac civilians, or helped me keep 3 birds up in the air.""


 


The mercenary pouted, ""still could have helped.""


 


Snorting, Tony, Harry and Vanessa looked up as Rhodey made a questionable sound, before pointing towards all of them. ""What is going on here?""


 


Tony winced, ""remember what I told you about Death, and how Merchant of Death is a title thing, that means I am one of her favourites?""


 


Rhodey nodded, ""Harry and Wade are the other two I mentioned, while Vanesse here is Death's human persona.""


 


Rhodey gaped at all of them, not really knowing how to respond to all of this. Which was understandable, you weren't in the room with a primordial being everyday - or at least not that you knew off. Accompanied by said primordial being's 3 favourites.


 


Before anything else could be said, Remus walked into the room, closely followed by Silvester - who was Tony's main IT guy, and Clint - the archer had been going over the date from the leak, to help determine which was important and which wasn't.


 


Remus nodded to all of them, before turning to Tony, ""I need you to sit down before I show you anything.""


 


The genius did as asked, having experienced that as long as he made Harry happy and didn't break his heart, Remus would treat him like another nephew. So for the werewolf to say something like this, meant it was serious.


 


Sitting down, Remus took the tablet from Sylvester, giving it to Tony before pressing the play button. Rhodey and Harry stood right behind Tony, looking with him at the clip from over his shoulder. The way the genius froze when the first footage showed a car on a rather desolate road, told them this wasn't anything good.


 


""I know that road, and I know that car.""


 


What followed was a clip that showed that Howard and Maria Stark weren't killed in a car crash because of Howard's drunk driving, but that they were murdered.


 


Their murderer looked right into the camera, most likely a hit ordered by HYDRA then.


 


""Do we know who he is?""


 


Remus and Clint exchanged looks, ""we do. He's the myth that is the Winter Soldier. HYDRA's top assassin, who pops up in history and vanishes just as quickly, almost like a ghost. As we have such a good picture of his face - even if it was covered - made us ran a facial recognition scan, we had a 92% match.""


 


Tony nodded, ""who is it?""


 


JARVIS answered, ""my scan showed that the entity known as the Winter Soldier has a 92% match with the person known as Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes, presumed KIA in the second World War.""


 


As soon as the name was announced, Rhodey and Harry had their hands full with calming Tony down. The genius, as both were well aware, had been a huge Bucky fan, more so than Captain America.  Something that was only amplified after meeting the man  and finding nothing like how Howard had described him.


 


Now, finding out that it had been Bucky who had murdered his parents, had murdered his mother, was becoming too much.


 


One childhood idol had already shown himself to be nothing like he had been depicted, but to have another one show up in such a way was devastating.


 


After getting the man to calm down, Remus and Clint looked at each other, before turning back to Tony.


 


""We were able to get through all of the data, some of it was posted online - such as the reports which HYDRA had over which events in history were by their hand.


 


Others are waiting for you, and the president, to go through and decide what will happen with it.""


 


Wetting their lips, both men looked at Tony, before Remus added, ""he didn't know what he was doing, Tony. We found reports about the Winter Soldier and all the things that made him go through before they had their perfect little weapon. If anything Barnes is as much a victim in all of this than you are.""


 


Tony nodded, his eyes still downcast, ""I figured. Still, finding out your childhood idol has been a prisoner of war for the last 75 years, and has been brainwashed into his killing machine hurts.""


 


Everyone around him nodded, feeling the same way, even without growing up with stories about Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. The names however were known by almost everyone, and brought back the joy of victory, and the pain of all those lost to secure that victory.


 


Rhodey hummed, ""now what do we do?""


 


""We got an appointment with the president to have him review all the data we found. We bring the feds up to date with the facts we found, as well as the multiple cases now being opened against Romanov and Roger's, as I assume all the former agents know exactly who was behind all this.""


 


As he said this, Harry looked at Clint, to see the archer nodding. Even in the case he and his wife told, the Brit found that he didn't care, they had dug this hole, so they could lie in it.


 


""Beyond that, we try to find out where Barnes is, as I think it's high time the man was allowed to come home. Once here, we can go and find specialised people who can break the conditioning they put him under. Maybe ask Jean or Charles for advice and help.""


 


With that decided, Clint and Remus left the penthouse again, somewhat feeling guilty for the pain they had caused the man who had been so kind to both of them. They knew this wasn't something that could have been avoided, but it still stringed to see the normally strong man reduced to such a state. Not that they blamed him, to find out his parents hadn't died in a car crash, but had been murdered on HYDRA 's orders.


 


Back in the penthouse, Tony laid down on the couch, his head on Harry's lap, while Rhodey kept standing behind the couch. Both of them exchanged looks the moment Tony covered his eyes with his hands. Their looks held the same anger for the man in their midst, for everything he had to go through and for everything SHIELD or HYDRA was trying to cover up, or had covered up.


 


""Tony, love, want to talk to us?""


 


Tha man in question sighed, rubbing his hands once more over his eyes, ""not really, but I know I'll regret it if I don't.""


 


Harry hummed as he ran his hand through his lover's hair, feeling the older man relax under his ministrations. 


 


""Hey, Rhodey, what would the army do to, or for, Barnes the moment he comes back to America?""


 


The airman hummed, ""treat him like any other POW, I suppose, only that he would be the longest one in history. He won't be drafted or called on anymore and I'm sure that they would pay for any treatment he'd need after all of this.""


 


Harry nodded, ""we might need that, if we do find him. Just so the president or the army doesn't think we're doing this for some kind of gain. Other than helping the poor man.""


 


Rhodey hummed, ""I'll try and ask around, see what the possible solutions would be as we retrieve Barnes, as I do think you and Tony will be focusing on that?""


 


Harry nodded, ""kind of have to, after everything he's been through, it would be a mess and a half if someone else snatches him up, just to use him again. If anything he deserves to be free of everyone trying to control him. With the contact we have, I think we'll be able to find someone willing and capable of doing so.""


 


Hearing a soft snore, the both of them looked down and smiled, seeing as Tony had fallen asleep, probably for the best, so he could catch up on sleep that would most likely evade him the few coming days as his mind would bring up what he'd seen today. 


 


Harry sighed, sometimes he hated the way Tony's mind worked, and the way it made sure his PTSD played up, so he couldn't sleep, would be much less energetic, and at least that was the case after New York, he wouldn't have an appetite.


 


Feeling a hand on his shoulder, he looked at his lover's best friend standing there, ""you keep an eye on him, Harry? And keep me posted on anything that happens, alright?""


 


The Brit just nodded, feeling Rhodey pinch his shoulder, before his footsteps carried him to the elevator, and into it as it went downwards so the man could make his way home. Harry sighed, before turning as the elevator dinged again, showing Harley coming up from where he had been staying with Teddy.


 


""Hey Kiddo, did you have fun with Teddy?""


 


Harley just beamed up at him, nodding his head, making Harry feel glad that their adopted son and his godson got along so well. He also had high hopes for the play date they had planned with this Peter boy Harley knew from therapy. Hopefully they would get along great too, giving Harley another friend for when Teddy was up state at Xavier's institute.


 


Mentioning the boy to come closer, he felt Harley snuggling into his side, mindful of Tony who was still asleep.


 


""Are you both okay?""


 


Harry hummed and looked down at the pre-teen resting against his side, tracing figures on his leg.


 


""We are, neither of us was really hurt in what happened, but we got some disturbing news after we got back, and Tony is having a hard time dealing with it. So, he's sleeping to stop himself from worrying.""


 


When he didn't get any response from the boy, he looked down and saw tears running down his face, making him move and sadly wake Tony, the genius looking up bleary eyes, which cleared the moment he saw the tears running down Harley's face.


 


""Hey sport, what's going on?""


 


Instead of answering, Harley threw himself at Tony, hugging the man tightly around his waist and hiding his side. the genius looked at Harry who shrugged, resulting in the man just running his hands over the kid's hair.


 


""Harley, can you tell me what's wrong?""


 


In between sobs they could make out; ""don't want to lose you too.""


 


Tony sighed, ""Harls, you're not going to lose us, we're both way too stubborn to die. I promise we'll be here to annoy you for a long, long time to come, alright?""


 


Harley wiped at his eyes, ""but Teddy said that Harry always got into all sorts of trouble, and that even uncle Remus jokes that this is one thing that would never stop. What if it kills you one of these days.""


 


Harry and Tony exchanged glances over Harley's head, ""Harley, we're fine, and we're going to be fine, no matter what happens alright, believe in that, we will always be able to come back to you and you'll always have a family here.""


 


The kid nodded his head, even if both Harry and Tony didn't believe he actually believed them when they told him. Looking at their lover, they decided to seek out Vanessa soon, to see if there were certain things they could tell to others. After all, the Lupin-Tonks family knew, as did Pepper and Rhodey, but other than that, neither had told anyone else.


 


Maybe it was time to think about approaching that too, to be able to comfort people with the knowledge that no matter what would happen in the future, Tony and Harry would be alright until such a time they both decided to pass on, and not one moment sooner.

In the back streets of Romania, the Soldier didn't know what he could do to make it all better. Before he had handlers, and while he never liked any of them, they were able to take the worries away and let the Soldier sleep, make sure he had everything he needed, be it for hygiene, or the next mission.


 


But now, ever since HYDRA fell, and took his handlers with it, and ever since he had met the blond man in Washington DC, it felt like another personality was trying to force its way through. He couldn't let that happen, the Soldier would stay here and try to make the best out of it, but having too many voices in his head would only make it more difficult to stay under the radar. Which was what he needed to do right now.


 


He needed to find out what was going on, what had happened and what needed to be done to make it all better. But he would do that if all the voices in his head kept on whispering things, and making it difficult to concentrate.


 


Whining he pulled at his long hair, wishing for once that he would be put back on ice, if only for the reason that it stopped the voices in his head. He needed to stop the voices in his head.


 


He hated that the blond he had met, the blond who had called him Bucky, had gotten multiple voices to speak again, just when they had fallen quiet. He seemed to recognize part of the Soldier, but going by what he observed, it was a part that was long gone and forgotten.


 


---


 


In one of the holding cells of the FBI building, Steve couldn't believe this was how it was all turning out in the end. All he had done was make sure HYDRA couldn't keep control like they had been doing ever since he went into the ice.


 


Not only that, but he found out that Bucky was still alive, maybe a bit lost, but he was still alive, and he needed Steve there to help guide him. Because who knows what he will get up to without him.


 


But worst of all, they - Nat, Sam and he - did all the hard work, but Potter-Black and Stark get all the credit, which wasn't even remotely fair. Not only that, but the moment they found out what HYDRA had made Bucky do, they would hunt him down and kill him.


 


He just knew it, he knew what kind of people they were, Potter-Black and Stark that was, they were rich, never had to work for anything in their lives and threw money at everything that didn' go their way. He couldn't let the both of them do whatever it was they wanted to do, least of all when it concerned Bucky.


 


What Steve didn't know was that Sam had been willing to issue a statement which didn't paint Steve in a bright light. Nor did he know that the FBI were monitoring his cell and they could read his lips - as he kept on mumbling everything he was thinking - and for him to think he had to stop Potter-Black and Stark with something, didn't feel right to the people watching the monitoring screen, especially when it had been those people that had saved all of DC, while the man in the cell had been happy to drop three helicarriers on the city.


 


They decided to consult a psychologist and see what was said, as it seemed that Steve Rogers, the famed Captain America was a danger to others.



After Harley's confession they all decided to just enjoy some time as a family, asking JARVIS to put on a movie so they could have some time not to worry about what was to come and how they would deal with it.


 


Plus, they had a kid to worry about. A young teen who had lost his mother and sister recently, but who had also been adopted by the most danger prone couple in the world. And for all that they said they'd always come back, the main reason they could promise that, was because they knew neither of them could die.


 


Not unless they specifically asked Vanessa, or Lady Death to take their souls, which wasn't anything they planned on doing anytime soon. Not while so many people here needed them, nor when they knew what would be coming soon.


 


During the second Lord of the Rings Movie, Harley had fallen asleep, with Tony soon following. Harley because he was just exhausted, while Tony had been able to shut his brain down by just watching a cinematic masterpiece, which had calmed him enough to be able to sleep.


 


Asking JARVIS to turn off the TV, Harry made sure to put Harley to bed first, before coming back and picking Tony up to get to their own bed. The genius groaned a little bit, but just turned his face into Harry's neck, making himself comfortable and snoring lightly.


 


Putting him down on the bed, Harry was glad they had both already been in relaxing clothes, so sleeping in them wasn't that much of a problem. Pulling Tony towards him once he also settled down into the bed, Harry smiled softly at his lover, before glancing at the bedside cabinet and the velvet box that was in it.


 


He had gotten the ring inside make from a piece of armour from the mark II, as a way to symbolise the new Tony Stark, he had also infused it with magic, and had gotten Vanessa to get him a gem not found on Earth to lay into it.


 


Now, he was no jewelry forger, but that didn't take away the fact that he had gathered the materials and asked the Goblins to forge it for him. As soon as they had some time to themselves, he would pop the question, but for now he would enjoy sharing the bed with his lover at his side.


 


---


 


Tony woke up from a nightmare which showed him the road his parents had died on, had been killed on, before his own memories took over. The anger he had felt at Howard for drunk driving, or what he had been told back then. The grief about losing his mother, and the feeling of loss he had felt soon after, now that he didn't have his parents here anymore.


 


Wiping at the tears on his cheeks, he sighed, and turned, seeing Harry laying with his face towards him, a slight smile on his face. Smiling softly, he looked at the dresser that held his treasure, a ring made from some scraps he had found from one of their first mutual project, overlaid with Starkanium, it was the perfect ring for the man that had found him when he didn't know he wanted to be found, and who had been there for everything that had happened in his life that led to him becoming the man he was today.


 


Even the news he had heard tonight wouldn't take that away from him. But he knew that HYDRA had been behind the hit, not Barnes, especially not with how many people described him. In fact, he believed, truly, that Barnes was their worst victim.


 


But he'd need some time to get over his Mother's dying moments, to stop hearing his father plead for her life, and soon after his own. He would never forget, but he wouldn't take that out on Barnes.


 


Sighing, he rolled over, got up for a moment, and went to check up on Harley, the kid had kicked off his blankets in his sleep, but he was still sleeping soundly, without any nightmares as he had been prone to the first few nights in the tower.


 


It had been those that had made them sit the boy down to talk about seeing a therapist to deal with all the things that had happened to him. 


 


Dr. Sweets was an amazing child therapist, and the progress Harley showed was testament of that. The fact that the Doctor held group sessions with kids of the same age was also something that they liked, as it would seem that Harley would get a friend out of it.


 


He grinned, he didn't know who looked forward to meeting Peter Parker more, he and Harry, or Harley - even if the kid already knew him. Meeting outside of therapy had to be different too. But the boy's aunt sounded like a very nice, if slightly overworked woman, who loved her nephew to bits.


 


Tomorrow would be a great day, he was sure of it.


 


---


 


Harry woke up without Tony next to him, getting up, he found his lover leaning against the door to Harley's room, looking on as their adoptive son slept.


 


""Tones, it's late, what are you doing up?""


 


Tony hummed, ""nightmare, wanted to check on the kid, he was really worried he'd be losing us too.""


 


Harry approached and wrapped his arms around the other's waist, ""which is totally normal, he just lost his mother and sister, of course he'd be scared to lose us too. For all that he knows, we just won't come back home one day. Which honestly isn't that wrong of a thought, we just have a little bit of added protection on that department.""


 


Tony nodded, ""still, I want to do something for him, to let him know that we care and we don't scare him every time we go out, or have to step up as a member of the task force.""


 


Harry nodded, ""maybe some kind of beeper, but like a wrist watch, so he can beep one of us and talk to us, whenever he thinks something happens or is happening, to comfort him that we're both just fine.""


 


As he said this, he could almost see the numbers running around behind Tony's eyes. To have a genius as a lover.


 


Pushing the other man in the direction of his lab, Harry grinned, ""go on, we both know you won't be able to find peace unless you figure this out.""


 


Tony looked sheepishly, but went on his tiptoes to press a kiss to Harry's lips, ""love you.""


 


Harry grinned, ""love you too, wake me up when you need anything.""


 


Tony hummed, already lost in the calculations in his head, making his way to the lab.


 


""JARVIS, do wake me up if something were to happen, or when Tony needs me, will you.""


 


The Ai's voice whispered through the hallway, ""of course, sir.""


 


Nodding to himself, Harry turned and made his way back to bed. tony might be able to function with only a few hours of sleep, but he wasn't capable of that. Before going back to sleep he made sure to text Rhodey.


 



Gave him a new project to concentrate on. Had a nightmare, but didn't hide it. Will keep you posted.



 


He didn't get any reply, but he didn't expect one right away. After all, Rhodey slept like the dead once home, or at base, so didn't wake up by something vibrating on his bedside table.


 


Snuggling under the blankets, he made a mental node to start contacting people that might be able to help Sergeant Barnes, and who they could ask to help them look for the man. He was well aware JARVIS was scouting for the man using the internet, but that still meant they would need to approach the man and if he wasn't able to turn off the Soldier, they might get into a lot of trouble.


 


But those were worries for tomorrow, first thing would be the weekend they had planned with the playdate in Central Park with May, Ben and Peter Parker. Who he was very looking forward to meeting.


 


Closing his eyes, he was happy that their adoptive son was getting along so well with both of them, and adapting to all of the changes in his life. 


 


---


 


Tony spend the majority of the night bend over his work bench drawing up schematics of something like a beeper to worn on the wrist, which would let children call their parents, or the selective numbers programmed into it when they were afraid, needed to talk to their parents or guardians, or when they had something like a panic attack and needed someone to calm them down.


 


While it would help Harley immensely, he was sure of it, he also knew that more children could profit from this. And if he made it available and accessible for people of all classes, he was sure it would also have a positive effect on other things.


 


Stopping with the prototype, he sat back and looked it over, it seemed to be in order. He'd send it down to R&D to let someone else check it over, as he was sleep deprived and on edge right now, so he might be overlooking some things.


 


Closing off the tablet, he made his way back to their bedroom, slotting himself into Harry's bag from where the Brit was laying in their bed, a slight groan coming from him, before snores were all that he heard from the wizard.


 


Closing his eyes, he let sleep carry him away, well aware that ever since the Brit joined his bed, he'd had a lot more peaceful nights. It was almost as if the man had a very calming effect on those around him.


 


---


 


The next morning was paired with a very lazy morning, all three males of the Stark-Potter household had slept in late, so were enjoying a brunch at 11 AM. They had plans on getting freshened up and dressed before heading to Central Park.


 


Harley and Tony were discussing the plans Tony had gotten back from an overachiever at the R&D department who had still been at work when the plans were sent through. The young man had looked them over and hadn't been able to find even one flaw in the designs. Which meant production of the prototypes would begin in the coming weeks.


 


Tony had explained to Harley what it would do, and to get a children's view on what else needed to be added to make it more child friendly, and to be sure that everything that it needed was on it.


 


Harry just enjoyed his cup of tea while looking at the boys in his life, both of them adorable in their geeking out over the tech SI made. He was sure that once Harley became old enough the boy would enter the apprentice ship both SI and MI offered, just to be able to contribute to his guardians' companies, and to make the world a little better.


 


Getting a text, he was very happy to notice it was from Carol, who he had met the first day in the USA. She had won the case against her ex-husband, had been able to recuperate all the money he had embezzled from the company, and was now living the good life, with a job that paid well, and let her have time to spend with her children, who she had full custody off.


 


Mr. Abernathy on the other hand, was broke, lived in a run down apartment and had tried to get back in his ex-wife good graces in the hopes of getting money off of her. But Harry had made sure her lawyer got her the best deal, and with him owing her alimony, she didn't have to pay him a single dime.



The playdate in the park went exactly as they had hoped it would go, from the looks of the kids, and the other couple, they too had hoped it would go well.


 


The Stark-Black family had woken up with some time to spare, Harry very pleasantly surprised to have Tony laying next to him, seeing as he knew the older man had gone to his lab somewhere through the night.


 


But they used this time to cuddle a bit, and to just enjoy this time spent together. Until Harley came storming into their room, a huge grin on his face, jumping on the bed and hesitating just a bit, until they made room for their adoptive son in between them.


 


Just laying there for a moment, Harley began telling about how much he had looked forward to this day, to have a new friend to play with. Even if he had Teddy, but the slightly older boy was always at Xavier's institute through the week, and wouldn't always be there for him to talk or play with.


 


Hopefully having Peter as a friend would change that and give him something from the outside who would want to be his friend, giving him one more person to bond with. As with Teddy, most of the adults feared Harley becoming an adult too soon, with all the adults he hung around with.


 


Secretly they were also hoping that meeting Peter Parker could hold that off for a moment still. After all, pre-teens shouldn't be so grown up already. They should be enjoying their life, preparing for middle school, spending time with their friends and finding hobbies or other things to do that they like doing.


 


Harley however seemed to have missed most of that, first because his father left and his mother had to work 3 jobs to be able to keep a roof over their head, forcing him to grow up and look after his sister.


 


Now, it was in part because being a grown up was all that the kid had already known, and except for Teddy, he was around adults 24/7 instead of other children, which didn't help the situation any.


 


Today, this meeting with Peter gave them hope, as the sessions with Dr. Sweets had been helping Harley a lot, and they could see just how much it helped to be in these group sessions too. Maybe having a friend that also had some issues to work through there for when Teddy was away, would actually help him and take his mind off of everything his new parents did for a living.


 


It didn't make it any easier for Harry and Tony, knowing that their adoptive son had issues with people leaving him, which was logical after everything he had already been through, but wanting to do their share in improving the world. Something which they had already started doing ever since Tony became Iron Man.


 


Making their way to Central Park was accompanied by a very happy 10 year old, who was bouncing around the two of them like a happy little bouncy ball. It was cute to see Harley acting his age for once - before he'd only do that when Teddy was around, and even then, seeing as Teddy's a year older, he kept acting like that.


 


Out of the corner of their eyes they could see people looking at them, some even pulling out their phone and taking a picture, something which made Tony grit his teeth - mostly because it was a picture with Haryley in it.


 


After growing up in the spotlight, Tony had promised himself to never let any children he had, biological or otherwise, would be put in the same spot; where privacy was a long forgotten subject.


 


Harry hushed him, tightening his hold on the other man's hand as they made their way towards the park.


 


""It's just a picture, love.""


 


""I know that, but those pictures will appear online and then what. I don't want Haryley to grow up under the constant spotlight, like I did. Not only that, but I fear it will all become too much, and then what?""


 


Harry shrugged, ""if it ever comes to that, we'll figure it out. But for now, there isn't a lot we can do about people taking pictures, we're public figures, and as long as they just stick with pictures I'm sure we can manage.""


 


Tony hummed, ""I'm suing the moment they haunt us, or start haunting them though.""


 


Harry chuckled, pressing a kiss to Tony's temple, ""I didn't expect anything less.""


 


Tony grinned, ""you know me so well, Merlin, thank god for that, and thank god for you.""


 


Harry snorted, ""don't tell me you're going to start becoming emotional, now. We already knew this was meant to be, and I don't plan on going anywhere.""


 


""I know you aren't, Merlin, but that doesn't take away that after everything we've been through, and that we found out, that I can count on you for all of this. That you're here for me on every day - the good and the bad.""


 


Harry blinked, ""Tony...""


 


The genius shook his head, before reaching in his pocket and kneeling in front of the other man at the entrance of the park. Harley stopped and grinning at the sight, before taking out his own phone and recording this moment.


 


""Harry James Potter-Black, you've been in my life for 6 years now, and why I didn't do this sooner I don't know. But you're always there for me, on my lowest point and on my highest one, always. I couldn't imagine a life without you in it, and I don't want to either.


 


So, will you marry me?""



Harry sniffled, before reaching in his pocket to get out a similar box, ""only if I can get the same answer from you, Anthony Edward Stark.""


 


Tony grinned, ""you know I will.""


 


Harry laughed, ""then yes, I will marry you!""


 


Tony stood and placed the ring on Harry's finger, before holding out his hand and letting the Brit do the same thing to him, both of them taking a moment to stare at the ring their partner, their fiance, had gotten them. 


 


Harley barreled into them in the next moment, ""you guys sure pick the best moments to do stuff like that! But it was beautiful too, want me to send you the video?""


 


Both of them nodded and had to smile at the clip that was sent to them from, well, sent to Tony, Harley didn't have a phone of his own, but had been talking to Peter on where to meet on Harry's device - and had used that to film the touching moment between his guardians.


 


He had been beyond excited when the power couple had asked if he wanted them to adopt him, partially because it would take him out of Rose Hill, but also because it would give him a family again. He was well aware of what most of the people in Rose Hill thought about him, and about his Mother. So, even at 8 years old back then, he had known that adoption within Rose Hill wasn't an option.


 


Finding out about Tony Stark and Iron Man had been an accident, one that had pushed him to do better in school, to start enjoying science and make his own little inventions in the garage/lab he had made for himself.


 


To find the man himself one winter evening in Rose Hill had been like a dream, one he still hadn't woken up from, and one he wanted to last as long as possible.


 


To see his parental figures so happy, and loving together only made him realise this wasn't a dream, and that this was in fact his new reality, one where he would have parents again, that cared, and wanted the best for him. That always came back home, just like they promised and made sure he had the help he needed to deal with the trauma prior to meeting them.


 


Trauma that led to them coming to Central Park, to meet a boy he knew from therapy, to have someone else there to help him through the rough times, someone his own age, to relate to and to have with him as a confident, and a friend.


 


---


 


Coming down from their high of getting engaged, Harry and Tony looked down sheepishly at Harley, apologizing for hijacking his big day.


 


Only for the boy to wave it away, telling them he was so very happy for the two of them, letting slip that he wanted them to be his parents and that he was happy this happy occasion was in the works for the future - as the both of them deserved nothing less.


 


Tony took this as the answer he had been looking for, and texted Legal to start working on a way so he and Harry could adopt Harley legally as theirs, instead of just having guardianship over the teen.


 


When looking around themselves, the people standing in the Park during the proposal started clapping for the power couple that had done a world of good for everyone out there. Even if some had, had their doubts about how Tony Stark was made, Iron Man was one of the most liked Superheroes out there, which was only amplified when the man saved New York by flying a bomb into space.


 


Of course there were also the recent events in which both of then had finally shown the world that they were more than just regular humans, who used their powers for the good of the population. In fact most people adored Harry Black for keeping 3 helicarriers in the air for almost 3 hours before he got help in holding them up - just so DC could be cleared and no extra casualties could be made.


 


To see the both of them taking the next step in their relationship, something which had been speculated about ever since that kiss after the invasion of New York, was now becoming a reality.


 


The both of them and their charge, or son, was waving at all of them, before the young boy ran off to meet with another boy closer to the other entrance. Seeing that this was a family outing, some people yelled a congratulations to the newly engaged couple, or nodded, before going on their merry way.


 


If there was anything these people had shown them, it was that they too were regular people, if enhanced, that deserved their own time and time to spend with family and friends. Which was the very least they deserved.


 


---


 


With all the people looking on as his parents, could he call them his parents, he was going to do so anyway, were wrapping up, he spotted the brown hair that accompanied his friend Peter, so after waving at the people around them and letting Harry know, he ran towards the other boy and started chattering excitingly.


 


Forgetting to even introduce himself to the adult couple, most likely Peter's aunt and uncle, in his haste to catch up with the other boy. So lost they were, that they didn't even notice Harry and Tony joining them - quite a feat, as Peter adored the both of them, and hoped to be able to get an apprenticeship at either MI or SI once he was old enough.


 


Harry and Tony though, could only smile as Harley talked animatedly to the other boy, lost in the conversations instead of his own shadows, which was exactly what he wanted for their boy.


 


The other couple was doing the exact same thing for Peter, so this would be May and Ben Parker.


 


""Mr. and Mrs. Parker, it's wonderful to meet you, especially after hearing so many great thing about Peter, which of course reflect amazingly on the two of you. Thank you for meeting us here.""


 


May waved her hand, ""May and Ben, please, none of that Mr and Mrs. stuff, and thank you for meeting with us, we're sure you're both terribly busy nowadays.""


 


Tony shrugged, ""Saturday is family day, and we were really looking forward to meeting Peter. And we'll always make time for family.""


Slight spoiler for Falcon and the Winter soldier! But only just! 

For those who want to read, but didn't watch, there's a black man, who has a version of the super soldier serum, but who was cast aside and locked up because of that.


The playdate had been exactly what Harry and Tony were hoping for, not only could they see that Harley and Peter connected on a level that both boys needed, but they also seemed to need this time to just be kids and let loose, enjoying themselves in a huge park, where they could run around and do (almost) whatever they wanted.


 


Harry and Tony had to smile, seeing Harley letting go for the first time since he had moved to New York with them. He always seemed so serious and trying to be tough, to see him acting like an actual child was refreshing to see.


 


From the looks of the couple next to them, Peter had been the same, or hadn't been able to actually be a child in a long time.


 


Seeing them looking, May wiped away a tear in the corner of her eye, ""Peter had been so alone for so long. We took him in when his parents died in a plane crash when he was a toddler. We've never seen him like this, he doesn't really have friends - he is always so much smarter than them, and children are mean to those better then him.""


 


Ben nodded, ""plus both May and I have a pretty busy schedule with me being a Police officer, and May being a nurse. And we try to make it work, but neither of us can keep up with him.""


 


May added, ""when he told us about Harley, we almost thought it was too good to be true. But seeing them, I am so happy we did this. Thank you for agreeing to this.""


 


Harry and Tony looked at each other, ""we don't mind, really, and if you're both okay with it, we maybe can come and pick Peter us on the weekends and give them the Saturdays together. If you're alright with this, of course.""


 


The Parker couple looked at each other, ""we'd have to think about that, and look into what comes with it. As we know both of you are part of the task force being assembled to represent the enhanced community, so we'd like to know where our nephew would be in those situations.""


 


Harry grinned, ""totally acceptable. Think about it and come back to us with any kind of question you have, is that alright?""


 


The Parker couple nodded, going back to watching the kids after that, the two boys running around until both were hanging in their parents arms, almost asleep, but having had fun. Tony took them all out to dinner, nothing fancy, but he could see May and Ben appreciate the gesture.


 


They went their separate ways, with the Parker couple promising to let them know something on Wednesday at the latest.


 


Walking back to the tower, Harley was half asleep on Tony's back, the engineer looking over his shoulder at the boy from where he was nodding off against his shoulder. Harry couldn't help but grin at the two boys in his life, glancing at the ring on his finger, and to the one on Tony's he couldn't help but think about how happy he was that this had happened and how happy he was that he had found the other man, even with everything they had been through already, he had been through already, he was glad that love was still there.


 


---


 


As they got home, the rest of the family was waiting to congratulate them on the engagement, as Harley had - of course - send it to everyone in the family chat on WhatsApp, plus more people had posted the clip they had filmed on social media, where it was getting a lot of positive feedback.


 


The following week brought them back to work, where Harry spent most of his time on the projects they had ongoing about inclusive technology, as well as uses for Starkanium. While Tony had meetings with the president, and sometimes other leaders - as they proposal for an enhanced task force was taking shape.


 


The UN was even getting involved, and wanted to use their project on a global scale, to make sure that it wasn't only America getting covered should anything happen. However, they were soon comforted with the fact that Tony and Harry seemed to have the lead in this, and with MI and SI having offices just about everywhere in the world - this was seen as them not only interfering in America.


 


As they kept on proposing ideas, and reaching out to other enhanced, the idea was soon taking shape in a way that the UN was also standing behind, even if that was a work of months, where both of them talked with groups of enhanced or individuals. While also working for their respective companies, and their joint projects.


 


Plus they kept on working on the Winter Soldier, especially once they let it slip to the president that Sergeant Barnes might still be alive, and if he was, who knew who else had the serum.


 


In fact, it was because of them saying this, that they found a man that had been locked up after being a war hero, for the only reason that he had the super serum, or a version of the super serum in his blood, and didn't want to release that into the care of the government (and HYDRA - as they also found folders on the man in the HYDRA files).


 


As soon as word got out, the man was released and given the care he needed to deal with all that had been happening. He was also able to tell them that the Winter Soldier was indeed James Barnes, he'd had heard people talk about it, while he was held captive.


 


With finding Isiah, Tony got to work with digging through the files with Clint, Sylvester and anyone else formerly SHIELD that wanted to, to look for anyone else HYDRA had taken, hidden or taken out - to at least be able to let the families know what had happened to those people, to give them some closure.


 


They found several people who had been missing for years, in a bunker in Sokovia, being tested for whatever they could do with their enhancements, all for the reason to try and recreate them for their own purpose.


 


Finding a team to go with them wasn't that hard, as soon as they let it slip that there had been mutants there, the X-men had been jumping on the bandwagon, if only to take care of the kids that were no doubt being held there.


 


For once, they had to ask May and Ben to take Harley for the weekend, but with the times Peter had stayed at the Stark Tower over the weekends, neither had a problem with doing that this weekend. They had even said yes to Teddy coming along, as all three boys got along great.


 


After that initial weekend, May had called Harry on Wednesday to ask her questions, and to meet Remus, Dora and Andy - so she would know who would look after Peter when Harry and/or Tony were called upon. As they all got along too, and the friendship between Peter, Harley and Teddy grew - so did the friendship between the adults, with May and Ben glad to have people with kids about the same age. As they had been quite young when they had taken Peter in, resulting in a lot of their friends not seeing them anymore as they all were in a different stage in their lives.


 


But anyway, with the kids at May and Ben's, Harry and Tony were looking forward to dealing with this base in Sokovia, the files on it didn't spell a lot of good. As they kept testing children to their limits, so the body count was also high one.


 


With several enhanced on their side that could disrupt the cameras from the hideout, as well as Magneto who took pleasure in tearing open the reinforced metal doors, they were in before the HYDRA agents knew what was happening.


 


They made quick work from arresting all of them, leading them outside to the police cars that were waiting for them, in accord with the Sokovian police force, they would deal with the criminals and trial them under Sokovian law (which wasn't looking good for those that had taken pleasure in experimenting on children).


 


While they had agreed to let the Enhanced task force take the enhanced with them, to make sure they had a place to stay, where people equipped to deal with them were. With the size of Sokovia, they were not used to dealing with a lot of enhanced, and even less with rehabilitating them.


 


Luckily, Xavier and Erik were more than happy to house them and gradually integrate them into society, starting with the school, where they could also catch up on what they had missed while in captivity. Harry and Tony had agreed to come by once or twice a month, to see how they were going, and to write a report for the UN in how the reintegration was going.


 


After all, with being the leaders of the task force came even more paperwork, but one they gladly took on them, if it meant engaging the worldwide task force, so they were ready when Thanos came to Earth. They had even told the UN, and the President on what had been waiting on them on the other side of the Wormhole, and how both of them thought (knew) that it was only a matter of time before this army invaded to do who knows what.


 


Luckily, as soon as word got out on that, several people came forward to knowing that there had been aliens on earth before. And not the area 51 fables, but actual aliens, that had been seen around the 80's and then again recently (not counting Thor and Loki) who had been visiting family and friends here.


 


All in all, these people were for once not shoved aside, but listened too, and gave them an insight to abductions that did happen, such as a 10 year old that was taken away by a flying soccer years ago, as well as an airforce pilot that had just up and vanished after the plane she had taken an (un) authorised flight with had blown up after a collision with an unidentified flying object.


 


These were all things they kept on a list, to make sure that if these people ever came back, or there was a way of contacting them (which they had to ask Loki and Thor) they might just get an alliance going that went beyond their own planet, as they couldn't possible be the only planet that wanted Thanos and the threat he faced, gone.


 


---


 


One evening Vanessa appeared and regaled them with tales of a pre-teen that had been abducted on the orders of his Father, who didn't have any good things in mind with his offspring. As well as the group of friends he would gather, among them two of the daughters of Thanos, who knew what a tyrant their 'father' was and how much they wanted to end his reign of terror.


 


She also told them about Carol Danvers, the pilot that had disappeared, taken by the Kree, who were a warrior race set on expanding their empire. They had done dealings with Thanos before, and both hated and admired the Titan.


 


She also told them that both Starlord and Captain Mar-Vel would be great assets to their cause, should they encounter them and tell them about their plan to stop Thanos once and for all. For indeed, word had spread that Terra had been able to stop an invasion of Thanos' forces, which was something that not a lot of worlds (none really) had succeeded in doing. If word was to spread that Terra, or Earth, was planning a universe wide alliance to stop the Mad Titan, they might just be surprised as to who would help them.


 


With the number of people that were released back into society from the base in Sokovia, as well as other holding places such as those, the president, as well as the UN thought it a great idea to craft a certain set of rules pertaining to those enhanced individuals.


 


Even if nothing bad had happened, or not yet, it was without question that the enhanced community was starting to get into the picture more and more, starting with those that had helped them before, and had helped once more when Harry and Tony had stepped up to prevent DC from becoming a dead city.


 


With the influx of those freed from HYDRA's grasp, as well as the people either coming forward themselves, or others telling about others they knew, it became clear that the community was much larger than everyone thought.


 


But, as usual with things different then them, others rejected the appearance of enhanced and acted out. Leaving enhanced to sometimes not be able to do anything, as they were well aware that if they fought back, they would hurt a civilian.


 


As such the president, as well as the UN constructed a counsel which would decide on matters pertaining enhanced individuals, and what kind of laws that should be put in place both for them as for the people trying to hurt them (and the other way around).


 


In all it would mean that ever since the beginning, with the X-men and the Brotherhood profiling themselves, there would be a worldwide counsel and international laws that would oversee them and that could help them get the same treatment as everyone else, instead of being treated differently.


 


It had been something both the X-men and the Brotherhood had fought for, in their own way, so to see something like this be brought to life, and for both of them to be asked to sit in this counsel was an honor. 


 


Even Erik, who didn't have a stellar reputation after everything he had done as Magneto, the tide had turned after people had seen him help out in DC. And even if he had used the revolutionary approach, that didn't mean he didn't want the best for his own people.


 


But anyway, a counsel was appointed, with representatives from all over the world in it, wanting to have a way to overlook all these enhanced people, but in a way that wouldn't make them feel enclosed or even discriminated against. But it still had a long way to go, but for now it had already served its purpose, and helped with people that suddenly came into their powers, or for parents that had an enhanced child, but didn't know how to handle everything that came with it.


 


In those cases, it was a relief to know that Charles' school was still a thing, and with the counsel in place, he could come out and say that it was indeed a school for the gifted, but gifted as in enhanced, instead of in smarts.


 


With his school as an example, more of these schools were built, both as a learning institution, but also as a way to take care of those children that didn't have a home to return to anymore. 


 


As much as they wanted to let people know that this was all alright, and in some ways the next step in evolution, some parents didn't want a 'freak' as a child and were glad to get rid of their once beloved son or daughter.


 


Harry especially had a lot of trouble with that, as his family had consisted of his mother's sister, her husband and their son, who had never asked to take him in, but had done so anyway. Their favourite thing to call him had been 'freak', and part of him was looking forward to seeing the looks on their faces once they realised there were a whole lot more people like Harry in the world.


 


But they digress, the changes made to the world were done so over a longer period of time, a few years even. In which Tony and Harry managed to win favour with the public by what they were doing with their company, but also under the counsel - as the figure heads of the enhanced task force, and in recent years, the people that they were able to reunite with their families after they had been taken by HYDRA.


 


In fact, with everything about HYDRA slowly being brought to light, more than a few other people had been able to finally find peace in knowing where the family disappeared to. Or in Isiah's case, get the compensation they deserved for their services to the country, as well as the hell they went through when he returned and people in high places wanted a piece of the formula in his blood.


 


Through the man's help however, they had been given a glimpse into the mind of one James Barnes and the way HYDRA had used the man to get whatever it was they wanted. From what Isiah told them, plus what was found in the HYDRA files, the man more than deserved his retirement, once he was found.


 


In fact, the fact that he was still out there had been brought to the attention of several higher ups in the army, all vouched for by Rhodey, and checked thoroughly by the former SHIELD agents, in an effort to not give Barnes back into HYDRA hands.


 


Once they were all sure that was the case, Tony, Rhodey and Harry had the honour of telling these members of the brass that they had the longest POW ever, almost located. When it was revealed who, several of them had spit out whatever it was that they were drinking, not believing that a legend from WWII was still out there.


 


Together with army resources, especially since they still adored Tony, he might have stopped making weapons, he had given them a suit in the War Machine Armor that Rhodey was flying, and he was still their main supplier in protective gear. While seeing as none of the weapons now in use were of SI quality, the protective gear sure as hell was, and managed to make sure their people pulled through.


 


With all that in place, the counsel mostly operated by Charles and Erik, Harry and Tony were able to direct their attention to Barnes once more. In between the play dates, turned sleep overs, with the boys. And their own companies to run, it had taken them some time to be able to look for the man.


 


But with the army now also informed and the counsel kept up to date about their findings, a missing person's report was send out to all the nations under the UN, to ask that if Barnes was found they told the man he was able to return to the USA and would get the full support as well as any held he might need, to get over everything HYDRA had done to him.


 


With that mostly taken care of, and looked over by the SHIELD agents now working for both SI and MI, they had the time to look what else needed to be done to prepare for whatever came next.


 


They were making huge steps in preparing Earth for whatever may come in the future. Plus together with Asgard, they had the beginnings of an intergalactic alliance in the works. But they needed more, Thanos had been destroying worlds for eons already, long enough that Vanessa, or Lady Death grew tired of it, and wanted him gone, but couldn't interfere directly.


 


Plus, before, she had told them about the Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as Carol Danvers, or Captain Mar-Vel, all who were out there, and who most likely had already heard about Thanos. All they needed now was to make contact, and make sure that there was a way to contact multipla planets in an effort to stop Thanos once and for all.


 


---


 


It was a Saturday again, and with May and Ben both working, Peter, Harley and Teddy were having a movie night/sleepover in the penthouse. As all three boys were here and under the watchful eyes of both JARVIS, and Tony and Harry. Remus and Dora had taken to going out this evening, enjoying a date night between the two of them.


 


Looking at the three teens, as Peter the youngest, had recently turned 13, Harry and Tony smiled at the Star Wars marathon all of them were having. They usually had these sleepovers once a month, and always on the night that both Ben and May worked the night shift.


 


Before, Peter would be watched by a neighbour's kid, Skip, but ever since word got out that the older boy had behaved inappropriately with some of the kids he babysat, neither Ben nor May wanted to leave Peter in his care again.


 


Which had led to at least one of them having to call off the night shift whenever they both had one. something which had been causing issues, at least until they met Tony and Harry, and had asked the other couple to watch Peter during these days. Something neither men minded, especially as May and Ben had been just as accommodating to Harley and Teddy, the off chances both they, and Remus and Dora couldn't watch the boys for a longer period of time.


 


Sitting at the kitchen table, Harry was tidying up from dinner they had been having, while Tony was tapping away on his tablet, either finishing up some last minute work related stuff, or just making notes for whatever idea just popped into his mind.


 


When Harry's phone went off, he looked and was shocked to find it to be Christine, the doctor had called them several times over the last few months, ever since Stephen had gotten into that car crash that took away the steadiness in his fingers.


 


While they had tried to help as much as they could, both of them had stopped giving the former doctor money to mutilate his fingers even further. Especially when Christine had called them to vent about the way Stephen was hurting himself all the more with all of this.


 


Of course, this had resulted in quite the falling out between the male doctor and all of their friends, all who had stopped giving him the money he needed to make his hands workable again. Ever since then, he had gone on to sell everything he ever owned, just to have the money he needed.


 


Christine had likened it to a drug addict who needed to get his latest fix, just so he could function. Of course they had all understood, Stephen had graduated from medical school at an almost alarming rate, and had become a doctor to honor his sister, who passed because his parents couldn't find a doctor in time.


 


He himself had been willing to take difficult cases, and even succeeded in making sure that people who wouldn't be able to walk or function, had gotten a percentage of mobility back, which was deemed impossible.


 


They hated to see him like this, to know that this great friend of them sunk so low that even after getting every professional in the world to look at it, no one could help him anymore. He would forever be bound by hands that kept on shaking, and fingers that made him incapable of ever helping people again - at least in the way he had been taught to.


 


So to get a phone call from Christine telling them that the man had taken a flight to Nepal, of all places; because of a rumour that one of the people he operated on, who couldn't use his legs afterwards, had found a way to walk again.


 


Christine explained that the Doctor had used up all of his money, the last of his money, to buy a plane ticket to Nepal, for a rumor that might be just that, a rumour. He might return to them an even more broken man than before.



""What do you mean, he just up and left for Nepal with the last of his money?""


 


Harry could hear Christine sigh at the other end of the phone, the tears in the woman's voice more than obvious.


 


""He heard that there was a place there that might help. Had heard from an old patient of his that it could help him get on his feet again, like it did to him. That it could give him back mobility in his hands, and if not that, then at least a purpose in life.""


 


Harry hummed, seeing Tony surfing on the internet on his tables, in hopes of finding something about this miracle place.


 


""Do you have any idea what it is called?""


 


They heard Christine hum from where Harry had put her on speaker, ""Kamar Taj or something like that.""


 


Tony hummed at that, typing it into his tables, before it froze, as did most of the things around them. Both of them hummed as they turned the moment they felt a breeze sweep through the room.


 


""Hello Vanessa.""


 


She smiled at them, ""Kamar Taj is not something you can look into just yet. Everything that is happening to Stephen Strange, must happen, as it did in every other universe. In fact, what is happening right now is necessary for the continuation of this universe, and all the others in the Multiverse.""


 


Harry and Tony gaped at her, not really comprehending what they were hearing, not that they didn't think Stephen couldn't do such a thing, but to know that the faith of the Multiverse was in his hands, especially 'his hands' was a bit much.


 


""What could it possibly be that these people in Kamar Taj learn their pupils that makes them able to walk again after being crippled, and how is it that this place has never been heard of before?""


 


Lady Death sighed, ""the order of sorcerer's, under the leadership of the Sorcerer Supreme, have been active on this planet, and on more planets all over the universe, since the beginning of time.


 


They teach their pupils to harness the energy released by the universe itself, and to channel it to protect this dimension from the horrors that go on outside of it, as well as the entities that seek to destroy it.


 


The current sorcerer supreme's time is almost up, and with her death a new one shall be chosen, Which is where your friend comes in.""


 


Tony blinked a few times, before he started laughing, ""Stephen? Stephen is going to become the next sorcerer supreme? I can't believe that, the man believes in science even more than I do, and I got a taste of what magic can do with Merlin next to me.


 


But Stephen would need a lot of convincing, before he is willing to part with the belief that magic does indeed exist.""


 


Harry nodded alongside Tony, although he grimaced at the nickname, Merlin, but agreed with his fiance that to convince Stephen of the realness of Magic, and whatever else the sorcerers of Kalar Taj use and believe, there would be a lot needed.


 


Tony had stopped to think, before looking at Vanessa, ""they have the unknown infinity stone, don't they?""


 


Vanessa nodded, ""the time stone, and the relic that chooses the next sorcerer supreme, which is going to take a liking to Stephen the moment he uses it for the first time. As in every universe, Stephen Strange will find his way to Kamar Taj, and will be chosen as the next Sorcerer Supreme. This is one of the set points in time, as is Tony becoming Iron Man, or Harry being a wizard. These things are never different, the way they are approached might be, but the result is always the same.""


 


Harry nodded, ""so this is one thing that we leave for what it is?""


 


Vanessa nodded, ""I'm afraid so, this needs to happen, I can tell you that he will return a changed man, but not someone who is a danger to the cause you are both trying to work towards, if anything, he could become your greatest ally.""


 


Both of them sighed, but nodded, as life around them resumed again, making them go back to the conversation with Christine, which both of them were a bit dismissive about, even if they promised to keep an eye out. And if they suspected anything, the both of them would go and get Stephen back themselves.


 


The moment they ended the call, the elevator dinged and three boys ran into the apartment, shouting a greeting to the two men, before disappearing in Harley's bedroom. Ned had joined Peter and Harley in coming over as soon as he realised that Harley was the adopted son of Tony Stark and Harry Black, two of the biggest names at the moment.


 


Not only that, but the Filipino boy had obviously been nervous the first time he had arrived at the apartment, having known Peter for quite some time, and bonding with Harley just as much the moment their son entered the same school Peter and Ned were going to.


 


Even if the three of them went to Midtown, Teddy still went to Xavier's school for gifted youngsters, and found a relaxing time as the younger kids entered the tower. At school he mostly hung out with kids a couple of years older than him, which now included several of the X-men, such as Bobby, Kitty and Rouge, who had graduated.


 


But at home was the only time he's had kids his own age that could follow his way of thinking, and even more, that were willing to follow it as well.


 


But for the adults in the tower, as well as May and Ben, it was just amazing to see this normally so closed off teens, just blossoming with the friendships they had going right now. Their boys had people to rely on their own age, and while they never said it, it was nice to not have the super smart teen trying to figure it all out in their home.


 


Having a couple, they were friends with, that was just as smart, or where one of them was just as smart, was a great way to make sure that their kids were challenged enough. Plus, Tony loved to help them all out, and invited them into his lab more often than not, when they were home.


 


They might never make the things that they made for MI or SI, but the things the boys came up with were still amazing to see. Their latest project had been a working BB-8 from the Star Wars movies.


 


So far they had managed to make a moving droit, but he still didn't make the signature droits sounds, which was an issue they would be dealing with this weekend, as soon as Teddy came home to help.


 


---


 


It was only when the boys were asleep, having been able to make the signature sounds resound from the droid now happily following them around everywhere, that Tony settled on the couch next to Harry, the younger of the two looking at his fiance.


 


""Are you sure you don't want to spend some more time in the lab?""


 


Tony blinked, ""don't you want to spend some more time together?""


 


Harry grinned, ""I'm happy with the time we spend together, love, but I've seen the way your leg has been bouncing up and down in the last 10 minutes. Not only that, but I know you like to tinker on the ideas you get while playing with the boys.


 


Go on, I'm enjoying myself here well enough, I might just get an early night and prepare for tomorrow, when Pepper, Happy and Colin come over.""


 


Pressing a kiss to his temple, Tony whispered, ""you're the best, I'll have J remind me I need sleep.""


 


Harry nodded, pressing a kiss to Tony's lips as the other man was standing from kissing his temple, smiling as he went back to his lab. He shook his head, he didn't know why he would have a problem with Tony spending time in his lap, he had known when they began dating, that he was also dating the man's never stopping mind, it just didn't seem fair to expect Tony to stop thinking.


 


That would be like asking the Earth to stop spinning, or the sun to stop shining.


 


Settling down, he went over some of the reports on his tablet, filling in some paperwork Remus or Dora had sent him, so they could continue to work under the new legislations that were implemented for the protection of enhanced individuals.


 


While neither MI or SI would be in trouble with these new legislations, they still needed to fill in the paperwork needed, so their enhanced employees had a chance to start an investigation should they be mistreated solemnly based on the fact that they were enhanced. Kind of like the bans on racism and things like that.


 


Going over the paperwork, and signing where he needed to sign, before sending it back to his uncle and his wife, he put his tablet away to turn in for the night. Laughing as he checked his phone and got a text from Remus reprimanding him for working so later on a Friday night.


 


Before turning into bed, he made sure to check up on the boys, finding them all piled in Harley's room, stretched over the mattresses that were put on the ground, in something akin to a giant puppy pile. He took a picture and sent it to the whatsapp group they had with Remus and Dora, Ben and May, Frank and Carmen - Ned's parents, and he and Tony, to share the cute picture of their boys.


 


---


 


It was after the amazing day they'd had with Pepper, Happy and Colin, and when those not living in the tower had been dropped at their own homes, that Tony and Harry relaxed together on the couch. Harley was next to them on the floor doing some homework, when both their phones beeped and JARVIS spoke.


 


""Sirs, I have a hit on Sergeant Barnes.""


 


Looking at each other, Harry texted Remus, asking if Harley could come down, while Tony texted Rhodey and the committee to let them know that they had found Barnes and wanted to go and pay the man a visit.


 


""Harley, honey, Tony and I have an issue that came up pertaining to Sergeant Barnes, could you go to Remus, he promised you and Teddy could have a movie night.""


 


As neither believed in keeping things from their kids, both Teddy and Harley were well aware of the things Harry and Tony were doing right now. They might not be privy to all the details, but it was obvious that they liked that they weren't kept in the dark.


 


Because of that, Harley packed away his books, hugged both of them and made his way to the floor below theirs, to spend the night at Remus and Dora's apartment, having another sleepover with Teddy.


 


Looking at Tony as the man was in conversation with the committee about what could be done, and needed to be done for Barnes, which seemed to be rounding up, as tony thanked the other person for their time and hung up the phone.


 


""We have a go to do whatever we need to, to make sure that James Barnes feels comfortable coming back to the States. In fact, they are calling an emergency meeting for the enhanced counsel, to make sure we have back-up, as we will be going in blind.""


 


Harry nodded, before looking at the nearest camera JARVIS controlled, ""J, can you tell us what you got?""


 


""Certainly, sir, James Barnes is recognizable on a camera in front of a convenient store in Romania, where if I track the records, he's been staying ever since HYDRA fell. He hasn't been making any trouble, nor has he been doing anything out of the ordinary.


 


He's been trying to live as normal as possible, even if I notice some noticeable ticks that one might assume are from him being a POW for so long, he acts quite paranoid when there are a lot of people around him.""


 


Harry nodded, before looking at Tony, ""looks like we're going to Europe.""



Their trip to Europe was arranged rather fast, after they let the right people know why it was they needed to go to Romania, and informed the local authorities that they didn't expect a lot of resistance, especially not when they were able to get Barnes to sit down and listen to what they had to say.


 


After all, with their efforts, his pardon was just a fact of him signing it, and coming back to America, to find the best doctors possible to make sure that he was cleared of the triggers HYDRA had put into his head. As soon as those were removed, he was a free man, and welcome to do whatever he wanted. He'd have a very generous pension waiting for him.


 


Arriving in Romania, they were greeted by the Romanian president, who seemed a little star struck to be seeing them standing in front of him. Most likely also because MI and SI were once again expanding on a joint venture, and had chosen to build job opportunities in East Europe, which contributed to the stark struck.


 


Harry and Tony both shaked the man's hand, and grinned as his entourage, seeing the man's grandchildren looking at the both of them, holding an iron man doll in one hand, and a booklet on the 'superheroes' in the other.


 


With their global efforts for the enhanced, they had used the more known ones as some kind of PR, printing a booklet which had each superhero introducing themselves by (superhero)name, and things like their favourite colour, food and animal. Something kids could relate too, and with the way they were seeing those books pop up, they were doing well with children of all ages.


 


Waving once more to the little boy, as well as the girl standing next to him, they walked toward the chief of police, who had briefed them on the fact that they had some undercover people close by, just as a precaution.


 


But that the man they were looking for had been a model citizen, if a bit shy and skittish, but no one could blame the man, especially with the trauma he had gone through.


 


---


 


Arriving at the neighbourhood Barnes was supposed to live in, Harry and Tony could only wince at the level of poverty they could see all around, the clothing of the people wasn't even in a good state, and on every street corner there was at least one beggar.


 


It was sad to see, they were used to having money for whatever they wished, but seeing this confronted them once again that not even 80% of the world had enough money to buy something on impulse. Even worse, a large percent of that 80% wasn't even able to live with the money they earned or got, making it all a vicious circle these people were trust into.


 


Humming, Harry took a hold of Tony's wrist and told his watch, ""JARVIS, be a dear and look up how we can sponsor public housing, both in the US and in countries in Europe and Africa.""


 


""Of course, Master Harry, shall I also look into buying the deeds of the houses around here?""


 


""If you would.""


 


""Right away, I'll keep you posted on the process, Sir, Master Harry.""


 


Tony just shook his head, pressing a kiss to Harry's lips as he pulled the Brit closer to him, ""you have such a bleeding heart, sometimes I wonder how it is that you're still a millionaire.""


 


Harry grinned, ""because I come from old money, and I make it faster than I can spend it.""


 


Tony just hummed, grinning at his fiance, ""true that, you do have some amazing ideas now and again. Let's get going, shall we, so the good sergeant can come home.""


 


Harry nodded, not letting go of Tony's hand which he had grasped as he had let go of the man's wrist, walking towards the apartment building Barnes should be in. With no doorbell, they just went right up, knocking on the door that read 113, hearing the stumbling of someone coming towards the door to open it.


 


The door opened, letting them see grey eyes widen, before the door was closed, and opened again. The man that looked at them, this time in full view looked like he was finally comfortable, so part of them did feel bad for taking this man away from his comfort zone.


 


""Sergeant Barnes.""


 


The man bit his lip, ""James, please, I don't... I don't remember being a sergeant, I don't remember a lot of things, but I like the name: James.""


 


Harry looked at Tony, before nodding, ""James, then, may we come in?""


 


The man nodded and took a step to the side, letting them enter his modest apartment, where an old couch served as both couch and dining chair - going by the fact that there was no table and chairs to be seen.


 


Harry and Tony took a seat in the two seater, while James took a seat in the armchair that had a place by the couch, they could see the way the man was fidgeting with the fingers of his left arm.


 


""Are you here to take me in?""


 


Tony blinked, ""why do you think you're here to take you in, James?""


 


James looked at Tony, ""because I remember that, too well even, I know what I took from you. It seemed fair that you'd be here to kill me, or to arrest me.""


 


Harry looked at the man, ""what makes you think that, has there been any indication that this would be the way that you'd be treated?""


 


James bit his lip, ""there's this guy, who writes me, like clockwork, and I don't know how his letters find themselves in my mailbox, but he writes to me every week. Telling me how tony Stark would come to kill me, because that's just the way he does things, and I know I deserve that, but I didn't know what to think when you stood there on my doorstep all of the sudden.""


 


Tony grimaced, ""this man that writes you, is his name Steve?""


 


James nods, ""Steve Rogers, he calls himself my best friend, but I have no idea who he is.""


 


Harry sighed, and rolled his eyes, ""so even in prison he can make a nuisance of himself.""


 


Turning to James, he explained, ""Steve Rogers is the person once known as Captain America, and I guess once upon a time you were depicted as best friends. While you were assumed MIA however, he was thought to be KIA - having flown a plane into the arctic sea, but he was found a few years back, still alive.


 


We don't exactly have the best of agreements, as he thinks of us as rich know it alls, instead of people that know what they're doing, and just take a different approach from him.


 


Anyway, he was arrested just over a year back, after leaking confidential information onto the internet, trying to expose HYDRA, but in doing so also potentially harming many innocents when the personal files of people working for SHIELD were uncovered too.


 


Anyway, to make matters worse, he tried to crash three helicarriers on DC, to purge them of the HYDRA agents on them, which in the end, wasn't even 10% of the people on board. Had they crashed, the casualties would be disastrous, but because Steve Rogers delusioned himself into thinking he's always in the right, he hasn't noticed that what he was doing was the exact opposite of what his image stood for.""


 


Tony adds, ""what Harry wants to say is that Steve Rogers is a delusional fuckhead, who knew who killed my parents, it being HYDRA, and keeping it from me, because protecting you was more important than letting me know the truth.


 


He has it in his mind that all I can do is kill, because my father, and after that me, built an empire on weapons and waging war - even if I never waged war, just provided american troops with what they needed. He just doesn't see it like that, so in his eyes it isn't like that, but something totally different""


 


He heaved a huge sigh, ""and I had a difficult period, when I first saw the footage HYDRA had kept of the hit, but I never blamed you, you were just the weapon they used, which made my father let down his guard, as you used to be a friend of his.""


 


James nodded, ""I remember that part, I remember all the hits and all the faces, but I kept on thinking that I knew him from... before... but I never found out more. When I had flashbacks, they would put me back in the chair and erase me again.""


 


Harry winced, but said, ""which is another reason we're here, besiders the full pardon, and the army pension that is waiting for you. We were able to gather some of the best psychologists and neurosurgeons, to help you get rid of the triggers, and make it so you can live a normal life again.""


 


James swallowed, ""just like that?""


 


Harry and Tony nodded, ""you're the longest POW known to men, and not only that, but you served America well in the World War, people tend to keep stories about those people alive, unless something is stopping them from being told.


 


Anyway, we did this because it is the right thing to do, and you deserve this, so strings attached, even no contact after everything is said and done, should you want it like that. We're not doing this for any gain on our side, but we were sent because of the enhanced factor that you have, having been injected with a version of the super soldier serum.""


 


James looked at the two of them, once again fidgeting with the fingers of his metal arm, ""can I think about it?""


 


Harry nodded, ""of course, we're not here to force you either, just know that the option is on the table, should you want it. We'll be staying down the road, where there was a room booked for us, come over when you made your decision.""


 


---


 


Later that day, they called Harley, as it was late enough that the teen was awake, with the different time zones they were in now. 


 


""Hey kiddo, how are you?""


 


Harley grinned, ""I'm good, Ned, Pete and I got put together for a group project on physics, so I was wondering if we could use the lab?""


 


Harry sighed good naturally, while Tony grinned, ""of course, as long as there is an adult there to supervise, and I do mean a senior member of the staff, or Andy, Dora or Remus, no asking one of the interns or the newbies, they'd be too starstruck to keep an eye on you three hellions, four if Teddy joins.""


 


Harley groaned at that, the mirroring groan telling the men that the others were close by and listening in on the conversation, making the men laugh, ever since introducing the four boys to each other, they had been inseparable.


 


Harry shook his head, ""we're not letting any of you in the lab unsupervised until you're capable of eating and sleeping on time, it's the same rule I have in place for Tony. Only he has JARVIS to listen to. You boys know how to shut him out, and I don't need zombified teens in my house.""


 


Tony grinned at that, sheepishly looking at Harry as he thought back on the first time he bindged in the lab after they moved in together. Harry had locked the lab up for 48 hours after that, to make sure that he would get sleep before he went on a working spree again.


 


The conversation after that became one about school, Teddy's new hair colour and the amazing ratings they were getting with SI, MI, and the enhanced groups.


 


Harry and Tony closed off the call with greeting to everyone, before they went and grabbed a bite to eat in James' neighbourhood, which seemed to shock the people there, but gave them a very nice, authentic Romaniam meal.


 


All they had to do now, was wait for James to make his decision, and to either take the man back to America with them, or make sure he was safe here, that no one followed them, or the information leaked - as some people would pay a fortune to get their hands on the Winter Soldier.


 

Just to be clear, I am modelling this after Tom Holland's spiderman.But some parts of Toby Miguere's spiderman might make an appearance


They didn't have to wait long before they for a call from the reception telling them that one Mr. Barnes was there for them. Tony looked at the clock, not even 24 hours after their talk, the man was willing to tell them what he wanted to do.


 


Humming they went down to the reception, nodding to the worker behind it and found James sitting in one of the sofa's littering the hotel's entrance hall, a bit to the back, and surrounded by empty seats, just to be sure he was left alone.


 


Harry smiled at the man, before taking a seat, ""hello, James.""


 


The man nodded back at them, ""I... I am free to choose what I want?""


 


Both Harry and Tony nodded, ""you are, this is not us pushing you to do anything, but we do think you could use the freedom of not being bound by the words drilled into your head by HYDRA. And with the majority of them have been captured, we don't want to give them a reason to come after you again.""


 


James nodded, ""I'd like to go back to America, and be cleared of the triggers in my mind.""


 


He stopped for a moment there, ""I'd also like to be sure that Steve Rogers can't contact me anymore. I thought over what you said, and looked something up, and it all comes down to him behaving like a stalker. I don't know how long he'll be in jail, but I don't want to find him standing in front of my door all of the sudden.""


 


Harry nodded, quite worried, ""what makes you say that, because we in no way wanted to influence your opinion of the man.""


 


James shook his head, ""I don't remember what he is telling me, but from what you did, I can understand he has a very opiated vision of what he thinks happened and what didn't, which makes me doubt I can trust what he tells me. 


 


That, plus the fact that he keeps telling me he'll save me, but never has he said something about a psychologist, not in the way you did. 


 


Add to that, the fact that the tone in his letters tells me he wants something different from me, and I don't know what that is, nor do I want to find out. I just want to build up a life again, one without everything that HYDRA forced me to be, and one without all the things people expect from me - both because I am a POW, and because I was a soldier - I just want to leave that part behind me, and look for who I am now, after everything that happened to me. I think you guys are the best way to get to that.""


 


Tony and Harry smiled, ""we can do that, there is such a thing as a restraining order, once one has been issued, it informs the person it is against that they have to keep a certain amount of feet away from you. If they break that, as it is put on record with agencies across the country, and even across the globe, should it be needed, Steve will be arrested again if he ever gets out and approaches you.""


 


Harry added, ""and if you want, you can rent a room at the Stark tower, we have some living arrangements too, and Rogers isn't allowed into the tower at all.""


 


This had James looking at him, making Harry continue, ""if I remember you were from Brooklyn, we're in Manhattan, but I don't think you'll find something that fits you in Brooklyn anymore. Most of the people that live there are working class families, never or not a lot of single guys, so I don't think the home market there is suitable for you.""


 


James blinked, ""so you'll over me something in Stark tower, I would never be able to afford rent.""


 


Tony shook his head, ""it's rent free, both Harry and I are more than wealthy enough to have apartments that can be used by either our families, friends, or even employees.""


 


Harry nodded, ""we have the penthouse, below us is a pair of apartments shared by my CFO, his wife, who happens to be my cousin, and their son. While the other is my paternal great-aunt, who watches the resident children when we're all at work and they don't have school.


 


Below that is Tony's CFO, once she moves in with her own family, and an empty apartment which is used by any of her brothers, or our friends when they visit.""


 


This last had Tony looking up, ""Pep's moving into the tower?""


 


Harry snorted, but nodded, ""she told us last weekend when she came over. She and Happy had a long talk about it, after everything that happened, they'd feel closer with family around them. Especially now that Pepper and her brothers renounced the Weasley name, after everything that happened they just couldn't forgive their father. Taking on the Prewett name now that Molly isn't here anymore, they can be the family they need to be, without their biological father trying to dictate what they should and shouldn't do.""


 


Looking at James, he told Tony, ""I'll give you the whole story at home, alright?""


 


While Tony nodded, Harry turned back to James, ""some other people living in the tower are former SHIELD agents, who've all taken a job at either SI or MI after SHIELD's fall. Plus with Romanov throwing them all under the bus, none of them feel the need to return either. Plus under us, they can still help with the enhanced counsel, and by being able to oversee what is happening with it.


 


They wouldn't be able to do that with SHIELD, as those that still do, are forced to stay in the dark, after everything that happened those cleared and still working with or for SHIELD aren't that well received anywhere. Not after what they tried to pull, even if they never wanted to kill the population of DC, it almost came down to that, without anyone trying to stop it.""


 


James hummed, ""so this isn't some charity?""


 


Tony shook his head, ""no it isn't, this is a free over, to make sure someone born and raised in New York, has the possibility to stay there as he recovers. Plus it would be easier for any therapy you would take, as we have enough conference rooms that you wouldn't need to leave the building.""


 


James opened and closed his mouth a few times, ""then thank you, I'd love to.""


 


---


 


With James consenting to coming back to the USA, Tony and Harry put everything in motion to make sure their journey back was arranged as soon as possible, not in fear of James changing his mind. But more so they could go back to work, the both of them had after all dropped everything to travel to Romania.


 


James smiled sheepish at that, and apologized, something both of them waved away. They made the decision to come to Romania, and they would do so again, regardless of what they had going on right now. This was important too, and with all the work that had been put into finding him, and making sure he'd get everything he was owed, they wanted to be the ones to come and see him in the first place.


 


They also made sure that the apartment James was renting right now went back to the owners, and if they gave a little extra to get it fixed up, well no one had to know.


 


Boarding the private jet that afternoon, they found James lingering on the stairs leading into the aircraft, looking out at the skyline of the town he had stayed for the better part of two years.


 


""It feels odd, doesn't it, leaving something that has become so familiar.""


 


James turned to look at where Harry was leaning against the door into the plane, looking out towards the skyline as well, something in his eyes telling James that the man knew what he was talking about.


 


""What did you leave behind?""


 


Harry sighed, ""England, and the friends I still have there, but it held too many bad memories, plus my blood family had come to the US, so it was logical that I followed. Plus, with the inactivity of the UK branch, the US branch of MI had gotten big enough to be the place where Headquarters was moved to, as CEO it was clear I'd have to go too. It all played out well in the end.""


 


James nodded, ""that must have been tough?""


 


Harry shrugged, ""the people still there understood, and know they can come and visit whenever. I'm just happy to be here, well to be with family and friends, and to have met Tony while I was here.""


 


James smiled, and Harry was amazed to see that it was one that reached his eyes, ""I noticed, the two of you are very in love, and it shows, it's... really good to see that times have changed in that aspect.""


 


As the meaning of those words reached Harry, the Brit gasped, before nodding sadly, ""times really have changed, and a lot even, which is a good thing. Even if there are people that seem to think it was better before.""


 


James shook his head, ""not for people like us, I know more than one person who got beat to death just for loving the same gender, it was hell for others in the 30s, especially when the call for war came. The army was even more set in its beliefs, but that was also one of the reasons so many of us enlisted, to be sure no one found out.""


 


Harry nodded, ""I can understand that, the army only recently changed its politics surrounding that way of thinking. But with the movement growing bigger and more and more people coming out as members of the community, they had to do something - as with the previous rules, they might just lose quite a number of their best soldiers.""


 


James smiled, ""and it must be a positive influence, when two of the biggest CEO's, as well as one of the most well known superheroes starts a rather public relationship with a man. I think your relationship did a lot of good for the community too.""


 


Harry hummed at that, while Tony laughed from inside the plane, which they finally entered. But he grinned brightly as Harry took a seat next to him, James taking a seat across from the couple.


 


He nodded, ""we're indeed doing a lot of good promo for the LGTBQ+ community, I know we've been asked about doing a couple interviews, and even a few talk shows, but I keep rejecting them, as Harry doesn't really like being in the spotlight all that much.


 


As such, I didn't think he'd enjoy doing all that. Unless, you wouldn't mind?""


 


That last one was directed to Harry, who shrugged, ""I don't like paparazzi following us everywhere, and I still don't, but I wouldn't be against doing a few interviews and talk shows, if we make sure to get those that will not twist our words to make it something their own - I had that happen to much already.""


 


Tony hummed, ""I know a reporter that would be thrilled to do an interview about all this, and she's honest about everything. I like using her for press statements, as I know she'll sooner stop her career then give false information.""


 


Harry looked at his fiance, ""that's Christine Everheart, isn't it? Pepper always tells me that for all that she's like a bloodhound going after a story, she gives an honest story every time.""


 


Tony nodded, ""she also helped in uncovering Stane, it was her research that made me think about everything. Well that, and what he discovered on our own, but she wants justice most of all, and to bring people the truth.""


 


Harry nodded, ""she does sound like the perfect person to tell our story to.""


 


James put in his two cents, ""and think about all those people who'll read or see this, who will finally be able to place what it is they are feeling or experiencing. I noticed that not everyone accepts us, but it isn't as taboo as it once was, maybe this will be the last push people need.""


 


Harry and Tony nodded, making plans on telling Pepper, Remus and their PR departments, to make sure this went down the right road. 


 


After that, they filled the flight with some small talk, and even a nap during the night. When they woke up, they would be back in America, and James' healing process could begin.



Getting back to the USA was like they landed in a whole new world. They had let Rhodey know that James had agreed to come back with them, but to keep the brass off their back until the man was used to being back after 75 years.


 


Luckily, they had all listened, and managed to only have Rhodey wait for them at the airport, a suitcase in his hand and a frown on his face. The airman smiled at his best friends, and even at James, giving them a hug and the veteran a hand shake.


 


""What's with the suitcase, honeybear?""


 


Rhodey rolls his eyes, ""brass wanted me to take this with me. It contains all of James' paperwork, as well as anything he might need to get everything in order with city hall and other such things, as he has been declared MIA, possible KIA for 75 years. With us asking them to back off for some time, they asked me to take this with me.""


 


Tony sighed and rolled his eyes, ""I guess we'll make time to go over all the paperwork later. For now I just want to get back to the tower and get our vet installed into what will be his home for the unforeseen future. I also want to call Charles and see when he or Jean has time to come by - as I think both of them have the best chances of getting those triggers out of his mind.""


 


Rhodey nodded, before turning to James, ""I'm James Rhodes, by the way, but call me Rhodey, these two do, and I don't mind. Plus two James' will get confusing.""


 


James let out a small laugh, before nodding, ""nice to meet you, Rhodey, I'd introduce myself, but I have a feeling everyone already knows who I am.""


 


Rhodey shook his head,  ""they know who you were, or what you're supposed to be according to exaggerated stories, feel free to introduce yourself to me. I am sure a lot more people would love to get to know you, starting with the kids.""


 


James blinked, ""kids.""


 


Rhodey nodded, ""these two didn't tell you? They have an adopted son, Harley, and a godson, Teddy, who both live in the tower. Their best friends Peter and Ned are over all the time too, and I know all four of them have been looking forward to getting to know you ever since Tones and Harry announced they were leaving to see if you were willing to come back.""


 


James blinked at the couple that he had met recently, that had offered a place in their own home for his use, ""you're trusting me with your kids?""


 


Tony shrugged; while Harry smiled, ""I don't know if you can still call them kids though. Teddy's 17, Harley is almost 16, and Peter and Ned are 15, they're teens that go to the same school, well all except Teddy. But they are thick as thieves still, despite Teddy going to a different school.""


 


James still blinked at that, ""but they are still going to be in the same building, what if something happens that makes we lose control? I don't want to accidentally hurt the kids.""


 


Tony snorted, ""those kids would be able to stop a war from happening with their combined IQ, I'm really not worried about the Winter Soldier hurting them. Plus, if you try to, Remus will be there to stop you, he's stronger than you anyway.""


 


Rhodey blinked, ""how do you know that?""


 


Harry grinned sheepishly, ""because he was able to keep Logan and Victor at bay at the same time in the spar we had last month. Most of the people present were shocked, not expecting that, and I understand, Remus doesn't look like much, until you push him and then he's the most dangerous person on the field.""


 


Tony nodded, ""it was amazing to see, and the kids loved it even more, they all love Remus already because he is this really calm character, but to know he's even more, and total badass, was everything they needed.""


 


Turning back to James, Harry adds, ""nothing could happen at this time to make us kick you out either, we offered you a place at the tower, and we plan on keeping that. The only thing that will make you leave, is if you make the choice to do so.""


 


James looked at Rhodey, before looking back at the couple, ""just like that?""


 


Rhodey laughed at that, clapping James on his shoulder, ""get used to it, James, they do this kind of thing on a daily basis. Harry here made sure the wife of one of his former employees got to take over his business after he got arrested and served time for embellishment, making sure her hours were coordinated with the child care she already had, and that she had all the benefits she could enjoy. Carol to this day, still visits and sends a card at Christmas, even if it has been over 10 years.""


 


James looked shocked to hear that, but Harry waved it off, ""I take care of my employees, what kind of boss would I be if I let that sleazebag sit on what was mostly her work, all the while he let an intern do all the work and left his wife for some other woman, when it was the wife that got him the loan, through me, to open his business.""


 


Tony pressed a kiss to the other man's cheek, ""a good one, love, but sadly all too many people are willing to look away as long as the money keeps flowing.""


 


Harry frowned at that, ""not in the businesses I own or sponsor, everyone knows I have very strict policies on that, plus it's in the contract I let them sign. They sign everything over to MI the moment they break any of those rules.""


 


Tony whisteled, ""I need to get an in, in those contracts you use, love, they could have spared me a lot of trouble.""


 


Harry grinned, ""as soon as we're married, what's mine is yours.""


 


Tony's eyes only gleamed at that, making Rhodey growl, ""enough about the lovey-dovey stuff, I swear, you've been together for almost 10 years and you both still act like you just fell in love. It's both endearing and sickening for everyone around you both.""


 


Harry and Tony just laughed at their friend, who took it all in stride, leading James with him as he made his way to the car that was waiting for them. Introducing Happy to James, and greeting him properly, they got in and made their way back to the tower.


 


Where the next emergency was waiting for them. The moment they got out of the elevator, Teddy and Harley were upon them, stopping for one second to gush over James, before they were pulling the two over to Harley's room, telling the adults that something was wrong with Peter.


 


Harley bit his lip as he told them they had a field trip the day before, to Oscorp, and Peter had told him that something had bitten him. But this morning, after their usual sleepover - Ben and May were working the night shift from friday to saturday, Peter started getting a fever.


 


They had already called Remus up, but the man couldn't find anything except an accelerated heart rate, which was something quite usual for someone with a fever. So he had told the boys to let Peter sleep and to come and call an adult when something changed.


 


Something had indeed changed, as the moment Peter woke up, without the fever, he complained that the noises were too loud, the room too bright and he felt itchy all over.


 


With all of that, they hurried over to the young man on the bed, who hid his face in the first adult that touched him, in this case Harry. Who cast a silence spell over the teen, who sighed in relief when the background noise seemed to cancel out.


 


""Pete, can you tell me what happened?""


 


The teen groaned, ""went to Oscorp, didn't like it, like MI and SI more. got bit by a spider, I think, woke up and everything was too much.""


 


Harry looked at Tony, ""isn't Oscorp researching genetic manipulation?""


 


Tony paled at that, took out his phone and called; ""Bruce, I need you to get here asap, we think something bit Peter that is changing his DNA. Tell Greg I need you here now, you can fangirl over the newest project of the bioengineering lab tomorrow.""


 


Harry ran a hand through Peter's hair, ""Pete, remember Bruce?""


 


""Dr. Banner?""


 


""Yeah, Dr. Banner, he's coming up to take some of your blood, so we can find out what's wrong with you, alright.""


 


Peter nodded, still with his face hidden in Harry's chest. The brit felt the teen's forehead and asked, ""JARVIS, what's Peter's temperature now?""


 


""It's 90degF, Sir, hasn't been lower than that since he got in last night either.""


 


Harry frowned, ""That's exceptionally low for a human though, Peter, can you still move everything, feel every part of your body, or does it hurt anywhere?""


 


Peter shook his head, ""head hurts though.""


 


Harry hummed, ""that's most likely the sensory overload, do you feel different anywhere else, hun?""


 


Peter shook his head, and groaned as it hurt his head more by just doing that.


 


While they waited for Bruce to arrive, which shouldn't be long, Harry and Tony introduced James to Teddy and Harley, both boys were in awe at seeing the man standing there, but were too worried for their friend, to actually ask questions, or fangirl over him like they would have been doing on any other day.


 


Tony and Rhodey exchanged looks, as soon as Peter was on the mend, James would be introduced to the Fearsome Four, especially once all four got into the zone that was reserved for gen Z kids. That even they weren't able to decipher, much to the teens amusement.


 


Bruce, as expected, arrived not long after, Remus and Dora on his heels. Remus clasped Tony and Rhodey on the shoulder, hugging Harry and the boys, before turning worried eyes onto the teen on the bed.


 


""I didn't think it was this bad.""


 


Harry shook his head, ""we think something at Oscorp bit him that is changing his DNA, which is why he's having this reaction. You did the right thing, Remus, you couldn't know.""


 


Teddy hugged his dad, as the oldest of the kids, he also felt responsible that he didn't notice anything wrong with Peter, until he started running a fever. And even then, he assumed it was the flu or something like that. Not whatever this was.


 


Bruce took out a vial and went on to collect some of Peter's blood, standing after he did so.


 


""I'll get back to the lab and see what I can find. I'll call up as soon as possible, but the fact that he's awake and somewhat active gives me reason to suspect that whatever needed to happen already happened.""


 


Tony suddenly started grinning, ""let me know what you find on a molecular level too, will you Bruce, if I find out Oscorp has indeed been genetically altering animals, what's to say they haven't been doing so with humans. With all the enhanced popping out of the woodwork, some of them might even be created, and that is something we need to figure out and vring to the attention of the counsel.""


 


Harry tilted an eyebrow, ""and this has nothing to do with the fact that you don't like Norman Osborn and have been wanting to buy the company ever since before we were together. Even more so when they went into biotechnology, which is something we do too, just for different purposes - they want to weaponize it, while we use it for prosthetics and medical applications.""


 


Tony pouted at that, ""maybe, plus his son keeps trying to get an in with our boys, I don't know if I trust that. For all I know the kid is trying to steal my - our - research, and I wouldn't want that.""


 


Harry sighed, ""just because he's Norman's boy doesn't mean he'll do whatever his dad tells him too. If I remember correctly, you never listened to Howard.""


 


Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times, before turning, much to the glee of Harley and Rhodey, who didn't even wait to start laughing at the genius.


 


With Tony silenced after his remark about Harry Osborn, Harley assured them that they all liked Harry, even if he was a rich kid, but then again so was Harley - even if he didn't flaunt it - but Harry had also not known anything about the genetically altered spiders in the labs.


 


Harley had asked, more as a joke, when Peter started getting ill, but now with the fact that Peter would most likely wake up with altered DNA, they had to prepare for what this would mean. And make sure Ben and May knew what would change in their lives.


 


Tony and Harry agreed to tell the couple when they came to get Peter after catching up on some sleep after the night shift,by then they hoped that Bruce would be able to tell them more on what they should expect with the teen.


 


With Peter falling back asleep, they turned to James, a sheepish look on both their faces.


 


""We're sorry we haven't been settling you in, that alright if we do so now? If you want, I can also call Charles already, he let us know he was free this weekend and would be delighted to come over. If you feel up to it.""


 


James waved it off, ""the kids needed you, so I don't mind in the slightest. As for the psychiatrist, I don't know. Could you tell me what kind of man he is?""


 


Before either of them could answer, Teddy started gushing about the Professor, ""Professor X is amazing, he's always so kind and I know for a fact that everyone loves going to his classes for the fact that he's willing to listen to everyone who attends it. Plus he's really smart, he is a Professor after all, and he loves learning things, so at times you won't find him in the school, but at the university where he is learning for himself.""


 


Harry snorted, he should have expected Teddy to speak about Charles with such high praise, ever since Teddy started there, Charles made sure everything went just fine for the godson of two of his friends. And the fact that both Tony and Harry were recognized as enhanced made it easier for the kids to believe that they could have a very bright future ahead of them. The counsel also helped with that, but knowing that two of the most influential and powerful businessmen were enhanced and still came out on top, was very great to see.


 


He added, ""Charles is also a very kind and patient man, and an empath, so he can feel when people around him can't talk about something. He'll never push further than people are able to, and with empathic abilities, he also has psychic abilities, so chances are he'll be able to just take away the trigger words and make it so that they don't have the same meaning as they have now.""


 


James hummed at that, ""that's really something.""


 


Tony grinned, ""we know, we've known Charles for quite some time, yet all he wants to do is help people. And with the counsel now seeing the added benefit of enhanced in the community, they are trying to make sure that they can't be discriminated against, like before, for the only reason that they are enhanced.""


 


James just looked shocked, ""he's a psychic, those exist?""


 


Harry laughed, ""I forgot you've been out of it for a while, yeah they exist, same with other enhanced, in fact with the serum that you've been injected with, I don't think that you'll get noticed all that much anymore. After all there are people out there who get super strength, or speed, or the ability to jump really far. all of these abilities have been occurring naturally in some people, even if no one is sure how it is that some people become enhanced through a genetic mutation, and why others aren't.""


 


James waved a hand, ""that's going way above my head anyway. I'm just glad that I won't be standing out all that much. I could keep a low profile in Romania, because no one interacts all that much with each other. But here, I won't be staying only in the apartment, after all, I'm back in New York, I hope to be able to see how much the city has changed.""


 


Harry and Tony just smiled, ""alright, we'll show you to your apartment, and introduce you to anyone that happens to be here.""


 


Turning to their friend, they asked, ""Rhodey, can you stay here while we show James to his apartment, we'll bring him back so you can arrange everything with him concerning the army.""


 


The man nodded, turning to Harley and Teddy when the two of them took a seat next to him at the table, both of the teens talking a mile a minute, asking all kinds of questions to their uncle Rhodey now that he was here again. He didn't come by all that much as he had quite the active role in the military. The brass did try to make sure he had some time to work with the counsel and enhanced; now and again, but sadly those assignments didn't bring him around to New York all that much.


 


While the teens were keeping Rhodey company, and with Remus still in their kitchen so the two men could keep an eye out for Peter, they meanwhile led James to the 4th floor beneath theirs, where an apartment had been readied for him.


 


Harry opened the door, revealing a rather simple and spartan looking apartment, which James still thought was about double the size of the one he rented in Romania. But this was being given to him, free of charge.


 


""I can't accept this, this is at least double of what I rented in Romania, and you're just giving this to me.""


 


Tony hummed and shrugged his shoulders, ""still yours, we don't need rent for this, especially not when we can help friends with it. All that needs to be done is ordering the furniture, as we had no idea what you wanted.


 


But you can just tell JARVIS what it is that you want from furniture and he'll order it. The beauty of online shopping.""


 


James tilted an eyebrow, he had heard them talking to a JARVIS, and hear a voice talking back to them, but that still didn't explain who or what JARVIS was, ""and just who is JARVIS.""


 


A voice from the ceiling answered, ""I am JARVIS, Sergeant Barnes, Sir made me as a teen, and now I am the aI that controls this building as well as any other under MI or SI. Besides that I am also integrated into all of Sir's vehicles. You can tell me what it is you need for your apartment and I'll express order it.""


 


James gaped at the ceiling, before looking at Tony, ""I'm starting to see why HYDRA kept you on the do not engage list. Especially knowing you have an AI looking over you.""


 


Harry started laughing at that, much to Tony's embarrassment, the Brit added, ""That might be because when he got kidnapped years back, he managed to get out by building the first ever version of his iron man suit, with only scraps that the terrorist had. I know he got put on a lot of watch lists with that.""


 


Tony grumbled, mostly because that had been the reason he had appeared on SHIELD's list too, and that had ended all that well.


 


Harry just smiled, pressing a kiss to the other man's cheek, ""it was the start of all of this, with you getting the suit designed, we managed to slowly work towards everything we're still working on right now. And look at all we accomplished so far, dealing with SHIELD for a little while was just something that had to happen.""


 


Tony grumbled again, but nodded, ""still doesn't mean I have to like it. If they had neve butted in, and were honest about the tesseract, we wouldn't have had to deal with the invasion.""


 


At James' look, the both of them sat down to explain everything that had happened in the last 12 years, both from their perspective and from the world's. Starting with Tony's kidnapping and ending with the latest developments with the enhanced counsel, and the way all of this had impacted the world in a positive way.


 


James whistled, ""and neither of you thought it a good idea to talk about this on TV or somewhat, it would get a whole lot of positive attention, both to the queer community, the enhanced community and I think people would look forward to whatever else the two of you would be willing to tell them.""


 


---


 


While the couple was settling James in, telling him after their tale on how to order for his apartment, Rhodey and Remus were entertaining the two teens in the penthouse. Either of them was going to look at Peter, who was still sleeping in the guest bedroom. The boy's temprature hadn't gone up, but he seemed to just be sleeping really well, hopefully feeling better as soon as he woke up.


 


They really hoped they would be able to explain this all to Ben and May, and see what they could do so that no one else would have the same thing happening to them. For all that they could deal with whatever happened now, they were sure other families wouldn't be so easily accepting of this.


 


When Tony, Harry and James got back to the penthouse, the oldest of the three still in awe at everything he had been seeing, hearing and experiencing, just took a seat next to Rhodey, seemingly happy to have someone talking normally to him, helping him go over everything that he needed to fill out or sign for the army higher ups.


 


As he never expected to be in this position, he did need someone who had some experience in this to explain it to him. Not that Rhodey had that much experience on this, but he was a General, and as such had helped multiple of his men when they filled this out as they were honorably discharged.


 


James would be a special case, as he was the longest known prisoner of war, one that had willingly come back to the US, even after not knowing for sure what would happen here. He was after all missing quite a lot of memories from actually lucid times as the winter soldier, and even less from the time before all that.


 


While they were dealing with that, Tony and Harry were waiting for Ben and May to come up, they would need to talk over whatever it was that was going on with Peter. Bruce had sent an update their way, that he could see Peter's DNA changing in front of his eyes, but couldn't figure out what was happening with it.


 


For now, they were going to be honest with Ben and May, and help the couple with whatever they needed done. Even more, they were thinking about helping the couple financially too, if Peter had a higher metabolism or anything, they would need it. Even with both of them working shifts, neither made a whole lot of money. They could live comfortably, but they didn't have all the luxurity that Tony and Harry could afford for themselves.


 


To make sure that Peter could develop these new abilities, and have others looking over him, they were going to offer him - Ben and May - an internship to SI, and MI in relation to that, so none of them had to worry about Peter trying to figure this all out on his own.


 


When May and Ben finally arrived, still looking tired, they were in for quite a shock when Harley explained to them what had happened on the school trip, followed with what had happened when Peter woke up and what they found out from the tests Bruce took of the sample of Peter's blood.


 


They were happy that they wouldn't be alone in this, even if Ben wasn't all that happy to just accept money from the couple they were friends with. The internship on the other hand, was something they supported 100%, if only for the fact that this would be great on Peter's resume, and could be communicated to the school, so he could use those internship hours for his own hours later in his career.



When Peter did wake up, all of the adults present were happy to note that he wasn't suffering from sensory overload anymore. If anything, the light around was still a little bright, but other than that it seemed that the episode was over.


 


Ben and May especially were over the moon that it seemed that whatever had happened, was only a minor episode and wouldn't affect his day-to-day life.


 


With the way they seemed to be convinced that because it was so now, it wouldn't show up again. Neither Tony and Harry had the heart to tell the couple that it would appear more often, and might even give other changes.


 


After all, they trusted Bruce when the man said that he could see signs in Peter's blood that the spider bite was affecting his DNA. But for now, Peter would go home with his aunt and uncle, and come back on Tuesdays and Thursdays after school, together with the weekends when May and or Ben worked a night shift. Starting up his internship, much to his joy.


 


Harry and Tony promised each other to look after the teen, just to make sure that nothing was changed, all the while Ben and May hadn't seemed to comprehend that this wasn't something that would go away anymore. Peter, like an enhanced person, would have a different kind of DNA from now on, and the severity that it had changed him would have to be seen.


 


As the Parkers left the penthouse, Harley and Teddy waved after the other teen before they crashed into the couch. Harley taking a seat in between his parents, for all that he was almost 16 now, he still clung to the both of them when they left for a longer period of time. Even if he knew that everything would turn alright.


 


When he turned 15, when he had been with them for just under 5 years, they had sat him and Teddy down and told them that nothing would ever happen to them, nothing could happen to them, not unless they let it happen. They had even introduced both of them, and any other family member that wanted, to Vanessa and Wade.


 


Remus and Dora were the only ones who just rolled their eyes and chuckled as they told Harry that he was the person with the strangest kind of luck, luck that seemed to have rubbed off on Tony if this situation was any indication.


 


Pepper, already having known everything, just hugged them close, happy that even if everything else came to pass they would have each other, and Vanessa and Wade. Because she knew just how much Tony and Harry hated to be alone, so at least that wasn't something that could happen.


 


But anyway, back to present times, Harley sat in between his parents, with Teddy cuddling up to Harry's other side, looking at the movie that had been put on, none of them paying attention, but enjoying the time spent with family nonetheless.


 


Remus, Dora and Andy joined them as soon as the two women had cooked, giving out plates to all those on the couch. All of the boys and men taking them gratefully and eating the amazing meal. No matter what happened, they tried to make sure that they had these little family nights. And now with Pepper and Happy preparing to move in, it would be an even more recurring occurrence.


 


---


 


Taking what James had told them into account, Tony had Pepper contact Christine with the offer of an interview with the couple that didn't want to be interviewed. To say that the reporter didn't jump at the chance was an understatement.


 


They did the interview in one of the unused suits in the penthouse, which had been turned into somewhat of a studio just for this occasion. SI and MI's PR staff were present too, hoping to get some great shots to put onto the website, as they suspected that the moment this interview made it to the public it would have a huge impact.


 


Now, two weeks after the interview it would be airing on national TV, CBS having paid a lot of money to be able to air the interview. Of course Christine true to her nature had made sure that nothing could be cut and had threatened bodily harm to the people at the TV station should they do so. The fact that the majority of SI's lawyers were present for that meeting made sure the message came across too.


 


Neither Tony nor Harry had the urge to watch it, they would hear soon enough how it was received. They wanted to concentrate on Peter some more, seeing as the teen had reported that he had started noticing changes.


 


He was stronger, faster and more agile than he had been before, not only that, but he had taken over certain attributes of an arachnid, as such he could climb on walls and ceilings without much trouble.


 


As with Harley, and his Iron Lad suit, and Teddy with his half-werewolf attributes and magic, they trained the teens together, for the scenario that something would happen soon. They knew that the threat of Thanos would coon be upon them. But that didn't mean they wanted anyone under 18 on the field, in fact they wanted as little people as possible on the field when the time came. 


 


For now however, their efforts in trying to prepare for what was coming was doubling, as more and more people were volunteering for the task force, even more so since about 6 months ago a kind of pot burst out of the earth in Minnesota and started growing and growing, seemingly absorbing everything in its path.


 


As soon as it appeared, it also disappeared, leaving everyone and everything around the starting point covered in what was likened to ectoplasm or something like that.


 


They had been called to the place of the phenomenon, but in the end nothing could be done except cleanup which they had helped with in any way they could. 


 


---


 


A few days after the interview aired, the couple had been walking around in New York, when their senses pinged to let them know that something was happening. When they looked up, they saw what seemed to be a woman falling, Harry positioned himself under her and stopped her descent, catching her before she could smack into the floor.


 


She had fainted however, and the man that came down next had them on guard, as he didn't look like someone who was able to be reasoned with. The fact that his eyes were inlaid in black only verifying that fact.


 


However when three more men touched down, the other man turned and disappeared. 


 


Looking at the tallest of them, both Harry and Tony smiled, ""Stephen.""


 


Their friend however was looking at the woman Harry was slowly lowering in his arms, his eyes telling them that he didn't expect her to survive. Harry frowned, especially when he felt her pulse easily.


 


Gathering her in his arms, Harry smiled at Stephen, ""join us in the tower? We can look her over, and from the look in your eyes, as well as in the eyes of your companions, you all have questions.""


 


Stephen nodded and fell into pace with Tony while Harry lead their little group, making quick work in getting to the tower as soon as possible, especially with the way that people were stopping and staring at who it was that was standing there. Plus, the woman in Harry's arms wasn't helping.


 


As they turned a corner, he could hear one of the men hiss at Stephen, ""you know Tony Stark!?""


 


He and Tony snorted and Stephen answered with a roll of his eyes, ""obviously, Wong, I thought you did a background check on me. You would know that Tony and I mingled in the same circles, we became friends not long before Harry took America by storm.""


 


Harry cooed at that, making Stephen glare at the younger man, ""it's true and don't try to deny it, Black! I swear, life as we know it changed the moment you took a step on American soil, and going by everything that happened the last year, things haven't cooled down yet.""


 


Harry shrugged, ""not totally my fault, Tony is just as much at fault, and to be honest trouble just has a way of finding me, no matter what I try to do to avoid it.""


 


Tony snorted at that, but nodded at the statement, ""I could lock him up in the tower and that still wouldn't keep him or me safe, he really attracts trouble like a magnet, I'm still trying to figure out if it's some law of nature or not.""


 


Once in the tower, they all seemed to relax, even more so when Harry laid the mysterious woman down on the couch, feeling once again for a pulse and feeling one strong and even under his fingers.


 


""She seems fine, did something happen?""


 


Stephen nodded, ""Kaecilius hit her with something, she also seemed to be aware that this would be her last moment. she told me that the fall from the building is the last one she ever saw of herself.""


 


Harry sighed, ""she's been able to see her own future then, and wasn't able to see what would happen beyond that point, as she keeps herself back.""


 


The last man, the one who hadn't spoken scoffed, ""what could you possibly know. She is the ancient one, the sorcerer supreme who has looked over this world for millennials.""


 


Harry hummed, ""that might be, but even powerful beings have an end, and if she is so convinced that this was hers, I don't know if she'll wake up. The mind is a powerful tool, should you know how to use it.""


 


The same man scoffed, glaring at the still unconscious woman, ""she's a hypocrite that's what she is.""


 


Harry tilted his head, ""why, because of what she found out for herself and warned you against, or the fact that she used the same spells as Kaelicius did?""


 


The man was shocked to be asked this question, but Harry continued, ""if what you say is true, then she has been around for a long time, learning all that she could most likely. Those things also include those things that you find are not the right things to teach others. Kaelicius is a prime example of that, his eyes don't spell a lot of good for his future, and the way he was willing to sign his very soul over to another being isn't something to be done likely.""


 


Stephen gaped at his friend as Harry said this, ""how do you know all this?""


 


A female voice answered, ""he doesn't, but I do, and as my favoured he can get to this knowledge too.""


 


The three sorcerer's looked up to see Vanessa standing there, the same one that scoffed at Harry scoffed at her, ""you don't look like much, miss, so excuse me for not believing a word you say.""


 


Harry and Tony took a step to the side as Vanessa tilted her head and looked at the dark skinned man, ""I don't look like a lot, yet everyone longs for me at some point in their life. I am there at the beginning, and at the end, for everything in the multiverse. I was here first, and I will be here last, so yes, I might not look like much now, mortal, but that can change in a heartbeat.""


 


As she said this, Vanessa shed her human disguise, leaving her standing there as Lady Death, looking a now deadly pale sorcerer in the eye.


 


""Do I still look like 'not much', sorcerer?""



The man shook his head, sweat beading on his forehead, only giving a deep sigh as Vanessa donned her human visage again and turned to the woman on the couch, a soft smile on her face.


 


Harry looked at her, ""her time is up...""


 


Vanessa nodded, to the horror of the others in the room, ""she had been waiting a long time to be able to rest, so I wouldn't let her stay, even if others wanted to. She found her successor, it's time for her to rest.""


 


Harry and Tony took a step back, seeing the woman's chest stop as her breathing did too, the men at the front, Stephen especially weep as they realised what was occuring. The ancient one would be no more, and as such Earth would be without a sorcerer supreme.


 


Vanessa on the other hand, looked at the man in the middle, ""there is a new sorcerer supreme, Stephen Strange, for no other will be good enough for the eye of Agamotto. She knew her time was up the moment the artifact, and the infinity stone it holds, accepted you as its wielder.""


This chapter and the 2 following will be a bit of a filler. But, the Infinity War arc starts after it :)


The very first time Peter joined Harley and Teddy in training for the inevitable, Harry and Tony were shocked to find out that the youngest boy had gotten quite a few traits from the spider that had bitten him. Not only was he capable of climbing walls and ceilings, he also stuck to objects, or objects stuck to him - sometimes it was funny to see.


 


Harley and Teddy, as teenage boys did, had a blast finding out just what Peter was capable of. Something neither Tony and Harry had a problem with, they were there to keep an eye on things. Plus, it wasn't intended for anyone to fight in the battle that was to come, but they believed in better being prepared instead of not being prepared at all.


 


Which was a sentiment shared with people around the world, as more and more people joined the enhanced counsel, or registered, sometimes with a codename for the sole purpose of being ready for whatever came next. In the interview by Christine Everheart, Tony had been very straight forward with what he had seen on the other side of the wormhole.


 


After talking it over with the president and the main body of the counsel it was decided to share all that with the world, if only to make it clear to all of them just what they were preparing for.


 


The fact that a lot of people were taking this rather well, also meant that they were more relaxed at handling all that was coming next. They had people closer to them, Stephen being the latest to be included, who knew more than they let others know. But they needed others in on the whole Thanos thing. 


 


Thanos; they might be able to handle between the three of them, the Chosen of Death, but if he invaded with a whole army, they needed everyone there that they could convince to be there. Not that they liked that a lot of people had to fight, but they were realistic in the fact that this wasn't something they could avoid.


 


Looking at the boys play-wrestling on the mats, Harry got a far away look on his face, one that made Tony look at his husband, a wide grin on his face.


 


""What's with the smile, Green Eyes?""


 


Harry grinned at Tony, angling his eyes down that little bit, before speaking, ""just realising that I have been in America for almost 13 years, Teddy is 17 - he was just 5 when I moved here and it seems like it was just yesterday.""


 


He looked at the boys again, before continuing, ""But being in America also brought me you, made me meet you and fall in love with you. It made us adopt a boy that needed a family so badly after everything that happened to him and I don't regret a single moment of it.""


 


Glancing at the matching rings on their hands, he added, ""and in the end, it made it possible for me to marry the man of my dreams. To build even more of a life with you, I didn't think that was possible after everything, yet here we are.""


 


Tony also looked at the rings on their fingers, a soft smile on his face. After the video of their proposal made it online, the whole world was privy to the fact that they would be tying the knot somewhere in the future. And as far as they knew, they were still waiting for the wedding of the century.


 


Their closest friends and family however, knew that about 6 months after the proposal, Vanessa married them in the hall of the Black mansion back in La, which had been transformed into a true picture perfect location for their Special Day.


 


With Vanessa conducting the ceremony, and the fact that all of the attendees were made aware of just which title Harry and Tony held, people from beyond the veil were able to join them for this special day. The look on Rhodey's face when he saw the powers of Death in the works was amazing too.


 


But true to character, his best friend, and best man, rolled with whatever Tony threw at him just as he had done at every previous occasion something similar had happened.


 


Pepper on the other hand was beaming from her place next to Harry, grinning at a dark haired and grey eyed man that hadn't let go of Remus ever since he appeared. When he found out this was Sirius, Harry's godfather and the reason Remus and Dora were a couple in the first place, he hadn't waited long to start talking to the man.


 


Sirius, together with who he now knew was Harry's dad, had looked him up and down, before giving Harry a thumbs up. The redhead next to his husband had giggled, her green eyes looking knowingly light in them, and showing Tony just where his beloved had gotten his Green Eyes from.


 


---


 


The biggest shock to both him, and the people he had seen, had been the fact that Vanessa had taken the time to search the afterlife for his own parents, and almost parents, so to see Jarvis, Ana and his parents standing there at one point had him in tears.


 


After everything that had happened, he was so glad to have a chance to talk it over with his father, and to apologize for being such a difficult son, and for always assuming the worst from his father.


 


His old man on the other hand, had apologized for everything, even telling him he was beyond disgusted for what Steve Rogers had done and said to his son. He never believed the man in stars and stripes would be capable of that. But it would seem he was wrong.


 


In the end they had hugged, and forgiven each other, before Tony went on to hug his mom really tightly, and hug and thank Ana and Jarvis. Before grinning like a loon when he introduced his parents, and godparents, to his husband.


 


---


 


Tony grinned as the memory faded, pressing a kiss to their now linked hands, ""time does fly fast when you're having fun, Green Eyes, all the better, because I can't think of a better person to spend it with.""


 


On the mat, the three boys were protesting half-heartedly, telling their parents/uncles to stop with the lovey-dovey stuff. It was all taken in good fun, neither of the teens would want the couple in front of them to be sad, as together they were quite a force to be reckoned on. 


 


With the remissing done, the two men entered the fray, telling the boys the best stands for hand-to-hand. And while Harry was helping Teddy and Peter, Tony was helping Harley with his Iron Lad suit, calibrating it for the seemingly hundredth time.


 


They spend most of the afternoon like this, only taking small breaks now and again, before continuing with as much vigor as they started. It gave all of them hope that with enough force everything would be fine before the inevitable confrontation came around.


 


---


 


They had noticed something was wrong with their adoptive son a few weeks after Peter's first internship day had come and gone. Harley was prone to come home from school in a bad mood, sometimes even cursing, but shutting up the moment he was sure his parents could hear.


 


But Tony and Harry were well aware that something had been going on, and while they found it odd that Harley kept this from them, they were sure there had to be a good reason for the now 16 year old to do so.


 


The next time Peter was at their home, but Teddy hadn't come back yet, the couple had looked at the boys and asked, ""is everything alright?""


 


While Peter just beamed at them and nodded, Harley shook his head, making Peter's grin fade as the younger boy looked at the ground instead of at the faces of who he saw as his favourite uncles.


 


This in itself made both adults frown and look from their son to their favourite nephew.


 


""Alright, so what is going on?""


 


Peter opened and closed his mouth, but never said anything, until Harley bristled and said, ""there's this kid at school that doesn't want to believe Peter has an internship at SI. In fact, he's been on his cap for all things all because he brought his way into the school, but Peter got a scholarship and has amazing grades.""


 


Their son gave a sigh, ""he doesn't even believe that I'm your son, he kept calling me; your charity project as no respectable person would want to adopt an orphan. He keeps saying all these things, and with Peter's enhancements he's scared to do anything back, but the guy doesn't let up. Not even when we report him, seeing as his parents fund most of the school, so nothing ever comes from it.""


 


Harry and Tony frowned as they looked at the teens in front of them, ""and this is coming from a school with a very strict anti-bullying policy?""


 


Harley scoffed, ""as long as the bullies are scholarship kids or those with really bad grades, as long as it's from children whose parents fund them, or who get prestigious grades, they look the other way.""


 


Harry frowned even harder, ""that's bullshit, anti-bullying is just that, it shouldn't matter whose kid it is. I mean, they could lose some of the greatest minds of their time and for what.""


 


Tony shook his head, and put an arm over Harry's shoulder, when Peter spoke up, ""no one believes I have an internship either, not even the teachers. I mean, I put in all the paperwork and May was with me when we did so, but I think they misplaced it or something.""


 


Tony frowned, ""what kind of school misplaces paperwork like that, or treats the kids like that. I can't believe we actually thought this would be a good school.""


 


Harry shrugged, ""they do have an advanced program, and they accept internships as credit hours, which is what we do for both of them, and plan on offering Ned if he wants to.""


 


Tony hummed, ""I also think we should go and have a talk with the school if this is how they deal with everything, I don't think we want Harley, Peter or Ned to be bullied just because of what they don't flaunt, or don't do. Besides, This kid Harley talks about reminds me of the bullies in college, all bark and no bite. They think they can intimidate you, until something comes along that makes them realise just how much they fucked up.""


 


Harry nudged Tony, ""watch your language.""


 


Tony rolled his eyes, ""trust me Green Eyes, they hear a lot worse from school, TV or on the internet. I'm not really known as someone who is proper in language, they are used to it.""


 


When both teens nodded at that, Harry just sighed, and waved a hand to get Tony to continue. The older of the two looked at the teens, ""so seeing as you're staying here for the weekend, Pete, I think we'll be driving you both to school, if only to just have a talk at this school.


 


I don't like any of what I hear, nor the fact that everything they promise parents that enter their kids is only applied in certain cases, does not sit well with me.""


 


Peter gaped at them, ""you'd do that?""


 


Harry tilted an eyebrow, ""why wouldn't we?""


 


Peter flushed, ""because you're both so busy with so much stuff between MI, SI and the counsel, I didn't think either of you had time for something like this.""


 


Harley grinned, ""they don't mind, they would drop everything they are busy with if something is going on with either of us, or Ned, they're both just that kind of people. you better get used to it.""


 


The weekend came and went, and for once Peter and Harley were looking forward to a school day, if only because of what would happen with the people that either didn't believe them or bullied them outright.


 


The only other people knowing of what would be going down was Teddy, who had been as pissed off as his uncles had been, and Ned, so he was prepared for what was going to go down on Monday.


 


The Filipino boy had been speechless when Harley and Peter told him how Harry and Tony had reacted to the bullying problem. He already respected the men that were raising one of his best friends, but to hear they were willing to put everything on hold just to come to Midtown and deal with this was something else.


 


Monday morning saw both Tony and Harry still seated at the breakfast table with food laid out for Peter and Harley.


 


""Pete, we called May and Ben to explain the situation to them too. While they were disappointed you never came to them with these problems, they get the why well enough. They also gave us full clearance to act like your guardian in this case; no matter what happens now. 


 


Especially given the fact that we were added on the person to call list, just as they were on Harley's. If that too was 'lost' I'm going to let Pepper lose to these people.""


 


Harry snorted at that, while he himself never got around to having a PA, he did know that Pepper most of the time made sure that everything he still needed to do was either neatly arranged on his desk, or mailed him with a to do list.


 


Even if she wasn't a PA anymore, some things just never changed. Plus Tony went through PA's at the same rate he had been doing before Pepper, it didn't help that a lot of the applicants still believed they could get him into their beds. Those were the ones to be fired within the day.


 


Right now, they were on someone who was dubbing as both their PA's, but wasn't officially instituted in the position. Jennifer Walters was Bruce's cousin, who had been given a blood transfusion of Bruce's blood and was able to transform into her own version of the Hulk. 


 


When she had lost her job the first time she lost control, no other law office would hire her. Leading Bruce to contact Tony and Harry to ask for a job for his cousin, even if it was temporarily.


 


That had been 6 months ago, with things going just great between them. Jennifer was an amazing woman, who didn't have a lot of chances, but took everyone that was handed to her. Same was to be said about this. She was never late, did her work and didn't have a problem with staying late - especially not at the pay she was getting now.


 


She had also been the person they let know she didn't need to come in today, that they had something personal to take care of. Last they had heard, Bruce had also put in a day of leave, meaning the cousins were having a family day.


 


Looking at the teens sitting at the table with them, Harry grinned, ""alright boys, this is how we're going to do this. Tony is driving you to school in the car Happy normally uses, you'll both get out and we'll follow not long after.


 


If I have an idea about this bully, he'll be on you two the moment you get out of the car, so he'll be in for a surprise and a half when he finds us standing there.""


 


Peter just gaped at them, not knowing what to say. Finally his problems should be over, and he will have these men to thank for. It was one of the reasons he never told Ben and May, because the consequences of them interfering were more likely to be to his disadvantage. He was after all a scholarship student, his guardians didn't contribute to the school in any way, and as such he was disposable - no matter how great his grades were.


 


He made sure to tell May and Ben that, as the one time he had tried to do something about Flash on his own, that had been the threat issued to him. That they didn't need him in their school, and he was disposable.


 


However, the recognition of Tony Stark and Harry Black, they would kill to get that, and with the way they had been treating him and Harley, they would never be able to earn it. If anything other parents would know just how Midtown went about those that spoke badly about the children of their financial backers.


 


Tony and Harry, seeing the relieved look in Peter's eyes, looked at Harley, their son telling them what had happened the one time the younger boy had gone against Flash and the repercussions he had gotten - as the victim - because he was a scholarship student.


 


Harry sneered, what a school did that to its students. He wouldn't even be surprised that there were other things swept under the rug, all to protect their financial backers, as it was much easier to suppress people who were already there on a scholarship and wouldn't be able to compete with rich parents who were willing to throw money at lawyers and PR people to make it seem that the victim in all of this was the perpetrator.


 


Tony frowned, ""JARVIS, get me a list of all the children expelled from Midtown in an altercation with people who back Midtown, if we're doing this, we're doing this right.""


 


""Of course, Sir. Shall I warn Mrs. Hogan that she should expect you to cause quite the PR scandal.""


 


Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times, ""you do that, even if for once it's not one of my scandals we're talking about.""


 


""Of course, sir.""


 


---



While Pepper was initially against whatever was going on, she had been thinking about sending Colin to Midtown in a few years, but hearing what had been going on behind the scenes had her backing whatever Tony and Harry were planning on doing.


 


After all, she knew about Harry's childhood, as well as all the work he did and still tried to do against such problems. To hear that the school they sent Harley to was just the same, it hurt her, thinking back about the scrawny boy Harry had been when they first met.


 


To know that Peter and Harley had been subjected to bullying just the same, it hurt her, in ways that she didn't think was possible. She also had to scoff at the fact that Midtown kept repeating their anti-bullying policy, which if she had to believe the boys was only a given for scholarship kids, or kids whose parents didn't fund their precious school.


 


Seeing the list Tony had printed out, had her cooking in rage, all these people, brilliant minds all of their own, were kicked out of this 'prestigious' school, all because they were telling the truth, but the other party had enough money to make the problem go away.


 


""Shall I work with Jennifer, Dora and Maria to recruit these people, I don't think they will have the best chances with all of this happening, if we can help them in this way, they will still have a chance.""


 


Both Tony and Harry nodded at that, giving her the green light to go about doing that.


 


Looking at the clock had them rushing to the car and driving to Midtown, the two men in the car almost vibrating in their seats at the scandal they would unleash on this school. With the help of JARVIS they were able to get in touch with parents of kids who didn't have the backing of two of World's Mightiest Heroes (and wealthiest businessmen) to get permission to also include their story in whatever happened now.


 


Arriving at the school, they quickly realised that the boys had been set up, and were waited on by a group of boys led by who no doubt has to be Flash.


 


They can see Peter flinch the moment the other boy yells something at them, a cocky grin on the face of the bully, as he takes a step towards Harley and Peter. When he readies himself to push either one, he finds his wrist in Tony's grip. The older man looked unimpressed at the boy now palling and shaking at the fact that Tony Stark was standing across from him.


 


""I'll ask you this once, what was it that you said to my son?""


 


Flash paled a little more, especially once he recognized Harry standing with the boys, an arm over each of their shoulders, looking just as unimpressed as his husband with this teenage boy that seemed to think he would be getting away with whatever he had said and wanted to do.


 


Flash babbelend something, but it was enough to get Tony sneering at a teenager. So Harry interfered, getting the boy's wrist out of his husband's grip and steering him to their son and pseudo-nephew.


 


""He is not worth whatever it is you wanted to do with him, honey.""


 


Tony grinds his teeth, before whispering something to Harry which had the Brit palling, ""he said what.""


 


Tony just nods but keeps on walking, lest they both turn around and take out their anger on a teenaged boy who most likely only emulated what he saw his parents do. He couldn't touch the son, but he sure as hell could make it difficult for his parents.


 


Entering the school, conversation halted as people seemed to realise who was standing there, with the same boys that claimed to know them. Within moments, the principal was standing in front of them.


 


Trying to make small talk and assuring them that these delinquents were punished for using their names in such a way. The fact that he hadn't even asked them why they were even here, but assumed had the adults bristling. Especially as they felt Peter slinking and Harley tense up.


 


Harry cleared his throat, ""that's odd, because I was sure Harley's paperwork stated that we're his adoptive parents, just as Peter stated that we're registered as next of kin, and that both boys have an internship at MI, with exchange clauses to MI.


 


Yet, here you are, already assuming that I, and Tony, want these boys punished for an act neither of them committed. And for what, because they don't come from a rich family, or because we don't support this rotten, bully infested school that's so full of asskissers that the actual great students don't get a chance at succeeding as they get kicked out once they make a problem of the bullying and downright disgusting preference treatment going on.""


 


The principal swallowed thickly, ""I don't know what these boys have told you, Mr. Black.""


 


""Lord Black, and if you want to be full that's Lord Potter-Black-Peverell.""


 


The man looked at him, the sweat rolling down his forehead, obviously not knowing what he needed to say to turn this in his favor.


 


""Suddenly mute? Here's what you're going to do, you're going to call Eugeen Tompson parents and tell them to get here yesterday, after that you're going to sit in on a meeting you really don't want to be in. Are we clear?""


 


He stammered that he couldn't just ask that of these people, making Harry turn, ""alright kids whose parents here, who are not a financial backer, have had to drop everything to get here so they can hear just what a backwards school this was?""


 


More than a few hands got shot up in the ear, with Tony adding in the names of people of expelled children's parents, those that had given them permission at least, but their set up was clear. They were calling them out on their favouritism.


 


Harry turned back, ""I'd get to calling, Principal, before I go there personally.""



          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


In the end Mr. and Mrs. Thompson did come to the school, even if it was with a thundercloud above their head. Their noses into the air as if whatever was being said about their little angel couldn't possibly be true.


 


Going by the way they dressed and the way they behaved, both Tony and Harry could see that people couldn't win. Especially if they were just a working class family that had to use a scholarship to get their child into the school in the first place.


 


The look on their faces when they saw just who was waiting for them, had both of them palling; after all both Harry and Tony were known around the world. Even more so in America, and in New York.


 


To see the power couple sitting in front of them, a cold look in both of their eyes, they could see the other couple's eyes going to the boys next to them. He saw the wife pale even more, she obviously recognized Harley and Peter; which meant that they had spoken the truth all along.


 


Tony stood, his business mask on and a sharp smile on his face, extending a hand to Mr. Thompson, ""Mr. Thompson, I presume.""


 


As the man shook, with a weak as hell handshake at that, and sweat dripping from his forehead, Tony continued, ""we, that is my husband and I, we're here to talk to you about you son, who has been harassing our son and charge. I assume you have an ilking what it is like to have a child that is being bullied.""


 


As he said this, they could see the sweat beginning to drip in earnest, they were being called out on their lie that they had tried to sell, and had succeeded even in court, just to make sure that the people Flash didn't like wouldn't be in his school anymore.


 


With working class families, this might be a good solution (if that was your definition of good) but against Tony Stark and Harry Black, this wasn't something that would stick as both men were leagues above both of them in pay grade - and in the kind of lawyer they could hire.


 


Harry stood, ""here's what we're going to do, your son will issue a public apology and we won't make a point of this. If we hear that his attitude hasn't improved, he is ready to hear from our lawyers.""


 


The other couple almost fell over themselves in agreeing to that, just to make sure that this wouldn't come out. That they could save names in the dawn of literal justice. They would find out that neither Tony and Harry were planning on letting this go just yet, but they would for the Thompson couple.


 


As they left, they turned back to the principal, ""you'll be hearing from our lawyers, Principal, we aren't all that set up with the way our boys were treated. Not only that, but the obvious bias in favor of the rich kids, and whose parents sponsor this school is honestly disgusting.


 


You're a school, but you're toying with children's education like it's a gambling game. You single handedly made sure that bright minds had to do with a lot less, and can't achieve their dreams, all to protect a bully with rich parents.""


 


With that they ushered the boys out of their own seats and into the hallways, telling both of them to go to class anyway, but to let them know if anything happened. Neither man had the mind of just letting this go, and they would take legal actions not only for their boys, but also for all of the other children that had been the dupe of this school moral system.


 


Hugging Peter and Harley once more, they waited outside of the classroom as the boys entered, only to throw the door open as the teacher didn't let either say why they were late to his class. Threatening them with expulsion just for that, the fact that no one said something made them think that this had happened before.


 


Harry cleared his throat, ""boys, I changed my mind, we're going home. I heard of another better school upstate that would be a much better choice instead of this dump. I mean seriously; that teachers are allowed to talk to their students that way.


 


Ned, you're welcome to join, I'm sure I can call you mother to ask her if she'd mind.""


 


The Philippine boy stood just as fast, gathering his things and following Tony and Harry out of the classroom, the teacher still gaping after them, not able to say even one word. Students all around took out their phones to either text their friends about what happened, or to take to Social Media to tell the world how badass Tony Stark and Harry Black were.


 


---


 


As they suspected, Ned's mother didn't have any issue with Ned leaving with Tony and Harry, relieved to hear that something was going to be done with the school that had made her baby so anxious. The only reason Ned was still there was because he too was a scholarship student, and leaving meant they would lose that.


 


Harry and Tony had assured her that if this would still be the case, that they would cover the cost. But they were of the belief that either of the boys staying in that toxic environment would not be good for their development.


 


As this was going on, all the teachers and other schoolmates could do was look on through the window as Tony Stark and Harry Black left the school, not even coming to do something for the school, but instead taking a stance in favor of the students, and the middle class or lower students at that.


 


Several people texted those that had been forced to leave the school, to let them know that something was finally being done about what had made them leave. That they were certain that this time they would stand a chance of being proven innocent.


 


In all, the students, or most of them at least, of Midtown, held a new found respect for Tony Stark and Harry Black after that day. Even more so when mere weeks after this had happened, Midtown had been called to court to explain just what was happening in their school, and how they could have let it happen that rich kids were able to get away with everything, while less fortunate had to just lay down with the fact that all their dreams would be put on hold - only because of the fact that they had spoken against either the school, or against a child with richer parents then they had.


 


In fact groups on the internet called out to them in the best way, thanking them for helping those of middle class and lower, who were often discarded anyway because of their income (or their parents income).


 


Contacting the other kids that had been expelled from Midtown, but still tried to pursue academics, were asked if they perhaps wanted an internship at SI or MI, they had their internship program on point anyway. So saw no reason why they couldn't offer it to teens and young adults who had a lot of setbacks.


 


---


 


Once back home however, both Harley and Peter hugged them very tightly, thanking them for doing this. For standing up to what had been going on in Midtown, and making sure that the bullying they had to deal with would stop.


 


Harry huffed, ""it better stop, or I am having another talk with his parents. To know that they would let their son get such a twisted view of reality sickens me.""


 


Tony shrugged, ""they obviously both work, and good jobs at that, so don't have a lot of time to spend at home. It's the perfect combination to not actually know your child and to want to keep them happy. Especially here, when they could use money to keep their own perfect image of their son alive.""


 


Harry shook his head, ""do they also plan on being able to bribe or buy the company their child starts working at after he graduates? That's just too silly for words, to know that there are people there who think that way.""


 


Tony pulled him close, ""we both knew what we started when adopting Harley and semi-adopting Peter, we didn't want to have children running around the tower because of the publicity. And before you say anything, Harley, you are never and will never be a publicity stunt.


 


We made the choice of taking you out of Rose Hill, as you'd be lost there. Not only that, but you wouldn't be able to do all the stuff you're able to do here under supervision at that. We love having you around, and we love having Peter, Ned and Teddy around too.""


 


Harley didn't say anything, but his eyes looked suspiciously wet as he hugged Tony close, the engineer hugging his son close too. Whispering something to him that had Harley giggling slightly, rubbing at his eyes before he also hugged Harry - thanking the Brit for what he had done for him all these years, even more so since taking him in his house.


 


Harry just pressed a kiss to Harley's forehead and asked Jarvis to put on a movie (Star Wars, surprise there), laying down on the couch to enjoy the movie even if this was the hundredth time they had seen it.


 


That's how Pepper and Remus find them some hours later, and after questioning why the teens aren't at school they are stumped to learn that this is what is happening in mundane schools. Especially for people like Peter, who is now enhanced, and can't act against mundane teens, no matter how much he would have wanted to.


 


Remus sighed, ""I'll call Charles to ask if he wants to start muxing the students already, if he gives a green light you can all join Teddy in Xavier's institute, I know for a fact that they hold their no bullying rule with an iron fist.""


 


Harry giggled, ""I heard they left the one and only bully in a room with Logan for an hour, he came out crying and went to apologize to all the kids he had bullied. Bobby told me about it, the last time we went for a visit.""


 


The boys were already talking, cheering even louder when Remus got back to them that they were indeed putting the institute open for mundane kids too. If and only if they were sure that there would be no issues with the enhanced students.


 


Luckily, with Ned and Harley this wasn't a problem, Peter even less so as he was enhanced himself, and wouldn't need to hold back all the time. Between Colossus, Logan and Wade (who didn't live in the X-mansion, but popped up there all the time) they would be more than able to let Peter enhaust himself without the spider altered boy to fear hurting anyone.


 


---


 


Laying in bed together, Harry sighed as he looked at Tony, ""think this is the end of the peace we've been knowing?""


 


Tony nodded, pulling Harry closer, ""I think so, we've both seen Vanessa becoming more agitated. And I know we shouldn't, but I can feel every time he's killing off half of a people, can feel the universe trying to make up for the loss and not managing it.""


 


Harry also nodded, ""I know what you mean, I can feel it too, it gets stronger too, the closer he gets to Earth. I don't doubt that he'll be here soon, and then what. We can keep him busy, but there is no predicting just what army he takes along.


 


Last time it was the chitauri, what if this time it's the Kree, or another race that can wreck most of the people on Earth. The counsel is doing well, but will it be enough?""


 


Harry pressed a kiss to Tony's lips, ""we did whatever we could, love, there is nothing more we can do except fight for our world when the time is upon us.""


Starting chapter 50, as I said before, we'll enter Infinity War/Endgame.I also added a small part of Thor: Ragnarock (although it isn't canon-compliant). Enjoy, and let me know what you think!?


Their first clue that something was going to happen soon, was Stephen contacting them, explaining he had gotten a message through from Asgard that scouts from Thanos' army had been spotted. When the Asgardians had tried to take them out, it would appear that they were followed closely by one of the bigger ships that started attacking too.


 


With Odin weak as he was, leading the troops and falling not soon after all of this had happened (as they had expected seeing as they had all been aware he wouldn't go out laying in his bed). With Odin dead, Thor ascended to the throne, he however wanted to make sure his family and people were safe.


 


Asking his mother and Loki to get a message to Earth in any way possible, he went and collected the children of Loki from where Odin had kept them. With him now being accepted as the new King, the secrets of the last King were passed onto him - giving him the information needed to go and get Fenris and Hela (Jormungandr was luckily on Earth) using unknown passages underground to make sure that after everything, Loki at least didn't need to lose his children too.


 


While Thor had been doing this, Loki and Frigga had managed to reach out to the sorcerer supreme, to make sure that they had a way of getting safe passage to Midgard/Earth while Thanos' troops decimated what was once Asgard.


 


Harry nodded, ""what do you need?""


 


Stephen hummed, ""extra magical power, preferably from you - and a way to know where Asgard is, as I have no idea how or where this should be situated.""


 


Harry nodded, ""I can help with both of those, for one, I have more than enough magic to spare from this side to help and get the gate open. We can have Queen Frigga and Loki powering it from the other side.


 


As for where Asgard is located, I have to be honest in saying I don't know that either, but Hela does and she, like us, is connected to Lady Death. I can use that connection to open up a portal close to Hela, getting the other Asgardians through that way.""


 


Stephen let out a sigh of relief, for all that he was Sorcerer Supreme right now, it was very obvious that he was still getting used to this role, and the role he had in defending the universe against threats civilians never knew happened on a daily basis.


 


Harry smiled slightly, before looking at Tony, ""are we housing them in the tower? Or do you have another idea?""


 


His husband hummed, ""we can use the training facility upstate. It's bigger and it was designed for this reason - to make sure that all of our allies and whoever else comes to stop Thanos will have a place to stay and train.""


 


Turning slightly, he said seemingly to thin air, ""JARVIS, see what has to be done to make the facility upstate inhabitable for the Asgardians. And wake up FRIDAY, so she can keep an eye out on the complex while we're busy with whatever else.""


 


The English voice sounded, ""of course , Sir. I'll make sure FRIDAY is up to the task of keeping an eye out.""


 


Grinning, Tony nodded, ""thanks, J.""


 


Turning back to Harry, he grinned at his husband, ""that takes care of that. want us to go upstate already?""


 


Harry nodded, ""I think the sooner we can get them out, the better, before something happens to most of the people there. Let me see if I can get into contact with either Hela or Loki, and explain what we're going to try to do. The both of you already go upstate, I'll follow as soon as I tell Remus where we are and tell everyone to prepare.""


 


JARVIS' voice sounded, ""no need, Master Harry, they were put on alers the moment Dr. Strange appeared. They are all on stand-by to go to the complex upstate should it be needed. I also took the liberty of putting the defenses on, to make sure that STARK Tower can function as a shelter should they attack New York again.""


 


Looking at the two other men in the room, Harry nodded, before adding, ""send out a worldwide text to anyone we have on file. To let them know to be ready - that we got a message that Thanos is attacking Asgard. We'll have a little while more, but we should prepare anyway.""


 


---


 


Meanwhile in Asgard the people were huddled away in the underground shelters, feeling the ground shake with every blast that was shot from the weapon Thanos' ship employed. Several of the warriors, including the warriors three and Sif, had wanted to take the fight to the surface - but Thor had forbidden it.


 


""It won't matter, not when they shoot at us from the sky. The moment any of us step out of the shelters, you'll be shot down before a counter attack can be organised. I will not lead my people into meaningless death.""


 


Several of those under the Odin regime had looked at Thor with a new respect in their eyes. As seen before, Odin would just go into battle, without caring what happened to his men - as long as he could go to Valhalla. Those that had fled back underground would face no repercussions - not when they were not up to dealing with this on their own.


 


Hela suddenly gasped, turning to Loki, ""papa, the Master of Death has a message.""


 


Loki blinked, before letting out a sigh of relief, ""what does he have to say?""


 


Hela took a deep breath, ""he and the Sorcerer Supreme are planning on opening a portal in my vicinity, as neither have an idea about Asgard's layout. But he can tune in to where I am; so they'll be using that.


 


He, the Merchant and the Sorcerer Supreme have prepared a complex for all those who will be fighting Thanos on Midgard, that's where we'll be going as soon as we come out of the portal.""


 


She stopped talking for a moment, before adding, ""he also asks if we have any other allies that should be alerted to the fact that Thanos is here, and will no doubt turn his eyes upon him, either before or after he goes to Midgard.""


 


Frigga bits her lip, before nodding, ""I have a way of contacting the other realms, this Master Of Death is correct that we at least should let the others know what is coming.""


 


Loki and Thor nodded at their mother, ""you won't need to leave here, will you, Mother?""


 


Frigga shook her head, ""no, but I do need to be here for a little while longer. With them focusing on Hela, I'll stay here with her until everyone else is through.""


 


Loki looked at his brother, ""I think you should go through first, brother, is only to make sure no one makes it harder on Harry and Tony than it already is. They've been preparing for something like this, but that doesn't mean they know how to deal with Asgardians.""


 


Thor frowned, but nodded before looking at his niece, ""tell him we're ready, that I'll be coming through first and yourself, Mother and Loki will come through last.""


 


Hela nodded, staying silent for a moment, before she looked slightly to her left where a golden and green circle seemed to appear, as soon as it cleared out they could see a grass plain, as well as a building in the distance.


 


What they did notice was the three men looking inside the portal, two of which Thor and Loki recognized as Harry and Tony - making them sigh once more in relief. They didn't know the third man, but going by the orange magic sequences around his arms, they were almost certain this was the Sorcerer Supreme.


 


Thor nodded once to his family, before he walked through. Several others following the moment they noticed that he had emerged from the other side, greeting the three men waiting there for them.


 


---


 


With Stephen opening a portal to the complex upstate, they could get there much faster than if they had driven (which would take just over an hour), as this was time sensitive, they opted for the quick option.


 


Once on the grass in front of the complex, Harry entwined his magic with Stephen's, seeing the normally golden magic taking on a greenish shine, as was the color of his own magic. Telling Hela what they were planning on doing, it was still a sight to see the Asgardians standing on the other side.


 


The moment Thor had come through, with others following quickly behind their newly crowned King, all three of the men let out a sigh of relief that they had been fast enough. That there wouldn't be another race of people falling at Thanos' hand. Not when Harry and Tony had seen Vanessa stressing over the people that wouldn't be able to grow or to become what it is that they needed to, to make sure this universe evolved to its true potential.


 


Greeting Thor with a smile, he could see the new King talking to Tony, most likely to get an idea as to where he could let his people stay, and what they could do in return - they were refugees here right now after all. Their own home wouldn't be uninhabitable after Thanos' forces were through with it.


 


""I'm sure we have enough rooms for all the people that came through today, with still some to spare, just in case. I can get some of the others to come here, so they can show you to the rooms we prepared for your people?""


 


Thor nodded, ""that would be much appreciated. It has been quite the day already and I know some of our people need to rest. Especially with Thanos at Asgard, I fear we won't be having that long until he reaches Midgard.""


 


Tony nodded, ""I know, there had already been a message sent to prepare everyone. We won't be letting this go just like this. The small children and any of the non-combatants of our own will be safe in STARK Tower, especially with the extra defences laid over it. If you have any women and children that would be better there, I'm sure we can get Stephen or Harry to transport them there.""


 


Thor hummed, ""I think my Lady Mother would be better off there, as well as several of the other women who are expecting, or have small children. They shouldn't be here - as much as it pains me they would be better off away from the battlefield.""


 


Tony nodded, ""maybe go and tell that to your people, Big Guy, I'll keep an eye on the proceedings here.""


 


With Thor making his rounds, most notably to people with a child in their arms, or pregnant women, Tony directed his attention to Harry and Stephen. For some reason he kept on thinking this was going too easy, like Thanos was letting them get away. He worried his lip between his teeth as he kept an eye on the portal. The people on the other side, where he could see Loki, Hela and Frigga were thinning quickly - luckily.


 


Just as the Queen Mother came through, they could see a wall of the hideout getting blasted. Loki used the fraction of a moment to push his daughter through; the little girl (or seemingly little girl) hid in her grandmother's skirt as she couldn't see her father following through.


 


Harry however, as he should have expected, entered the portal from their side, despite the obvious attack going on. He knew the Brit wouldn't leave Loki to be recaptured by the Mad Titan, not after what happened the last time.


 


But that didn't make him feel better, especially with Stephen now having trouble keeping the portal open. He didn't know what he could do - not being magical and all, he had Death protection, and probably some other extra's, but he didn't have magic. 


 


This couldn't be it, not after all the things they had done to prepare for this, he knew that Harry would come out of this. He had to, they would stand together against Thanos and his ilk, protect the Earth and the universe with it. Make sure Vanessa's stress level lowered with the decimation of the Mad Titan and his impossible ideals.



When he saw the blast that made the underground hideout cave in on itself, Harry knew he had to do something. Even with Frigga and Hela on this side of the portal, Loki was still there - stupidly pushing his daughter through instead of picking her up and jumping through.


 


He clicked his tongue, saw that Stephen was still holding steady and pulled back his own magic to jump into the portal from their side. He wasn't going to leave Loki to Thanos and his ilk, not after last time and certainly not when the man deserved better.


 


Finding his balance on the rubbish that was everywhere, he concentrated on finding the spark of magic Loki carried within him. Finding it underneath some of the stones not far away.


 


Looking towards the hole that had been made, he didn't notice anyone entering at that point. Sighing in relief as he found the dark green armor the God of Mischief favoured. Using his magic to move the pile of rubble on top of the other man.


 


He frowned, as the man showed to be having a head wound, from the explosion most likely. 


 


He shook his head, but understood that he had wanted to save his daughter at that moment, instead of thinking about his own life. Death knows that he would have done the exact same thing if this was Harley, Peter or Teddy they were talking about. A parent did strange things when the life of their child was in danger.


 


Hefting the man from under the rubble, he heard a moan leave him.


 


""Loki? It's Harry, I'm going to get you out, alright. Can you open your eyes?""


 


Green eyes opened in slits, but it was enough for Harry to see that the other most likely had a concussion. Using a spell to stabilize his neck, the other man might be a God, that didn't mean he could break something - a vision came to him, most likely from another universe where Loki would die from Thanos snapping his neck - he shuddered at that, before lifting up the man and running towards the portal.


 


Just in time too, as the same creature he had seen in Loki's mind all those years ago floated inside, the rage on its face only making him laugh - that was two times he had thwarted him. Both times concerning Loki, he didn't give in a lot to his more ruthless side, but for these beings, and the Lord they served, he would gladly tap into that.


 


The moment he touched down on the grass, the portal closed, Stephen kneeling as he dealt with the strain it most likely had cost him. Smiling apologetically to his friend, the other man waved it off. With the way he looked at Tony, his husband had most likely told their mutual friend just what kind of person Harry was on the best of days.


 


Grinning at his husband, Tony shook his head before approaching , ""once this is all over, I'm locking you in a tower for a year or so. People always told me I'd get grey hairs from the kids, but I'm sure you have a lot more from you than from the boys.""


 


Looking at the God passed out in his lap, he turned to Queen Frigga, ""Queen Mother, Loki had a concussion, or he had one when I got him from under the rubble. I don't know if his magic might heal it like mine does, but sadly I don't have enough medical knowledge to counter it in anyone else.""


 


The woman nodded, kneeling down besides her son as her hands glowed with the magic she wielded. Feeling around Loki's head, she hummed before nodding, ""his magic took care of it. In fact he should wake up any moment - Thank you, Lord, for going to get my son.""


 


Harry blushed at that, waving it away, ""it was my pleasure, he is after all a good friend of ours, after last time, I wouldn't leave him behind like that.""


 


Frigga smiled softly at that, ""still, it takes a brave man to jump into the unknown like that.""


 


Tony, still standing next to him groaned, ""he has a habit of doing things like this on a daily basis, once again reforming my idea of locking him up in the tower as soon as this is over. Lest he start jumping off of buildings again.""


 


Harry just shrugged at that, ""I survived didn't I?""


 


Tony grumbled, ""but my heart almost didn't.""


 


Before anything else could be said, Thor appeared by their side, looking at his brother still in Harry's lap, to his mother, and sighing as she just smiled. No doubt letting him know that everything will be alright with Loki.


 


""Mother, allow me to introduce to you Sir Tony Stark, the Merchant of Death, and Lord Harry Black, the Master of Death. They have been our allies ever since Harry freed Loki from the spell the Other had on him. Besides that, they have been open for us to visit, and even now have made sure to give us a place to stay.""


 


He swallowed, ""this complex is for the warriors partaking in the upcoming fight. I know you can defend yourself just fine, but... I would feel better if you and the other women and children went to Tony's tower - it is a fortified fortress that won't be harmed in whatever is to come.""


 


Frigga took a hold of her oldest son's cheek, ""you're asking this of me?""


 


Thor nodded, ""I know better than to demand anything from you, Mother, but... it would make me feel better knowing you were protected.""


 


She hummed, ""since you asked, I shall be doing so. But the moment we get a message that we are needed, I will ride to battle.""


 


Thor sighed, but nodded, a soft smile on his face. For all that she was a Queen, and a Mother, it was often forgotten that she was also a warrior, and more than capable of fighting herself. But for now, she would take it upon her to protect the other woman and children.


 


""I will leave as soon as Loki wakes, for I am sure he wants to be sure Hela, and Fenris, are fine. I will be taking both with me, to make sure they are fine at the end of this - especially since it is said that Thanos is trying to court Death. I do not know if he means the Being, or my granddaughter.""


 


Harry and Tony looked at each other, but before they could speak, another did, ""it is I, he is trying to court, Queen Frigga, not your granddaughter.""


 


Looking up, they smiled at seeing Vanessa standing there, every inch Lady Death as she was, Wade at her side, a smile on his face. They knew that the assassin was looking forward to defending his Lady's honor against the Mad Titan.


 


Frigga stays silent for a moment, before bowing; ""Lady Death.""


 


Vanessa shook her head, ""none of that now, I am sorry for the loss of Asgard.""


 


Frigga shook her head, ""Asgard is a people, not a place, while we will miss it. After this is over and done with, maybe we can find somewhere else to rebuild. This takes precedence for now, as I fear Thanos had long been a fairy tail to the people of Asgard. To know that someone is out there that thinks he can court Death by killing off half the universe.""


 


Vanessa shakes her head, ""he fears dying more than he wants to court me. In his mind however, courting me in this way means that for every life he takes, I lengthen him with the time that soul has left.""


 


Harry snorted at that, ""that's not how that goes, and I think he knows it. But with the decimation of half the universe, the survivors would be needed to make sure that it doesn't collapse in on itself. For some reason I think he knows that good enough.""


 


A weak voice spoke up from his lap, adding, ""he knows well enough that he can't prolong his life. But in his quest to court Lady Death, he stumbled upon the infinity stones, which made promises no one could keep - as expected.""


 


Looking down at Loki, they were all relieved to see the god's eyes open, Harry helped him sit up, staying in the ground until such a time Loki could stand, mulling over the words the other man had uttered.


 


""The Infinity Stones don't make idle promises, it's just that no being other than a Primordial would be able to wield all of them.""


 


Looking back, they saw Stephen get to his feet. The time stone he carried glowing faintly, as the sorcerer spoke. He joined their group, standing next to Tony, helping Loki get to his feet as well, while Tony pulled Harry upright.


 


Harry nodded, ""which makes it all the more dangerous, as I know a Primordial refuses to touch the stones. We don't even know what will happen if we touch them, as her champions.""


 


Wade opened and closed his mouth, but didn't say anything as Tony glared at him, the genius looked at his husband with a soft smile saying, ""let's hope we never find out.""


 


Sighing, he added, ""but yes Wade, you can try if we don't have another choice.""


 


The mercenary cheered at that, to the baflement of everyone that didn't know his special personality. Vanessa, Harry and Tony just smiled at the red clad man as he started skipping around - most likely already thinking about how amazing it would be if he handled the infinity stones.


 


For all that Wade was an amazing person, he did come with a bit of a manual, if only to be able to make sure that you knew that he didn't mean any harm (most of the time), and would do anything for the people he liked.


 


Loki in the meantime was telling his children, including Jormungandr who had appeared as Harry was getting Loki before Thanos' forces could get to them, that they would leave for STARK Tower with their grandmother while they all took care of the invading forces. Neither Jormungandr nor Fenris (both looking like boys of 12 and 15 years old respectively) didn't like this idea, but they seemed to be giving in. Even more so when Harry told them his and Tony's son as well as his friends would be in the tower too, in the event that they did need firepower there.


 


Stephen, having caught his breath, opened up a portal to the Tower, letting the women and children pass through towards the safe haven, all the while others residing in the Tower and willing to fight passed through in the other direction.


 


---


 


As their forces started to gather, Harry made sure to call the Council, letting them know to prepare and for what. That the Asgardians were at the compound or the Tower, getting ready to deal with the invasion that was practically on their doorstep.


 


Turning to Thor, he asked, ""did you get a message out to the other realms? Or to other allies further into space?""


 


Thor nodded, ""Mother warned the other realms, they most likely also contacted their own allies, to at least warn them of what to come. I am hoping that it stops here, that this is the end of all this - but of course we don't know that.""


 


Harry nodded, ""I believe the same, but again, we won't know until this is over and done with, until we win to make sure the universe is safe.""


 


The Thunderer nodded, ""I'm going to go catch up with Clint and James, I'm sure we can expect the others soon too?""


 


Harry nodded, ""the call was sent out, and the council was called to give them an update. We'd best prepare for whatever happens now, as I don't think we'll have a lot of time to prepare, they'll be on us before we know it.""



As the Agardians were settling in, words came back to them about all the people who had received the missive they sent out. JARVIS took great pride in letting them know that all over the world people were getting ready for what was to come.


 


None of them were willing to just leave it as it was, they were all willing to fight for their world, their planet, and with the report they made with witness reports from Loki, Thor and Queen Frigga, people were even more unwilling to let the Earth get decimated, or destroyed, by someone like Thanos.


 


It did however help that with everything the counsel, and Tony and Harry, had been doing, no one was looking surprised at the amount of enhanced individuals running around. If anything; it made sure that the civilian populace was sure that they had a force that was able to fight back against what was coming.


 


With women, children and Queen Frigga going to the tower, and Thor returning with James (Bruce was staying in the tower, to oversee everything from there) who became the first to gather at the compound ready to get out and fight Thanos.


 


When they had first started planning this Harry and Tony had assured James that he didn't need to be a part of this, that he could stay in the tower with the teens and only act if the tower was threatened.


 


But the man wouldn't hear any of it. In the time living with them, he had reacted very well to the therapy they had made sure he received. Not only that, but he was adapting to living in the 21st century very well aided in part by the teens running around in the tower, who while in awe at him, were also very up to date with everything and took the time to explain it to the man.


 


As such, seeing him all geared up had Tony just clasping his shoulder before introducing him to Loki and Stephen, both who he hadn't really met before then.


 


Rhodey radioed in not much later, telling them that the armed forces, not consisting of enhanced, were also preparing to act as back-up, or to protect those places that didn't have any active enhanced.


 


War Machine touched down not soon after, telling his best friends that he would be there with them. To make sure this alien army wouldn't be able to take Earth.


 


Others, such as the Fantastic Four and the Defenders also let them know they were ready, but staying in New York, just in case. With Stephen and the others of the order, they could go wherever they wanted in the blink of an eye, but there was no guarantee they would be able to be everywhere.


 


This way, and with others doing the same thing all over the world, they at least were able to know which regions or cities were protected.


 


Harry just about choked when an otter patronus appeared carrying Hermione's voice, telling him that the wizards and witches from all over the globe would also be helping. With those in England and the UK, doing so because of the missive he had sent to them. This was their world too, and after everything he had done for all of them, the least thing they were able to do was support him in these troubling times.


 


He had known, from Pepper, that Englang and even the other magical conclaves were preparing as well, but for Hermione to let him know like this, it warmed his heart to know that his best friend after everything, would stand with him like this.


 


But being told it is so, or getting confirmation that they were preparing just as much as they all were, willing to fight for the planet they inhabited instead of waiting it out behind their wards. That only showed just how far they had all gone - how far they were willing to go, compared to the previous people in power.


 


Tony, knowing just how big of a step this was, just made sure to hug Harry close to him (something made slightly difficult with the Brit being bigger than him) feeling the other's body relax at the fact that they weren't alone, it would be the whole world against the invading forces. And with such an army, they were sure to win.


 


Vanessa, who hadn't left since arriving with Wade had hovered by them, almost as if she hadn't been willing to part, had wanted to stay here even if it was for moral support.


 


Harry turned to her, as soon as he gathered himself, ""you shouldn't be here when he enters our atmosphere, Lady Death.""


 


Vanessa bit her lip, looking at her Champion, her Merchant and her Master, before nodding, ""I'll be watching though. I have no doubt that you'll win, but I want to keep an eye on things anyway - just in case.""


 


Harry nodded, ""we'll be fine, My Lady, you have other duties to attend to then waiting here for what could essentially be our downfall. We will fight until the last breath to make sure that doesn't happen. We'll be fine, go.""


 


She lingered just long enough to say goodbye to Wade before she disappeared into the In Between, no doubt making sure that she or one of her reapers were able to keep an eye on all of them in the case that this all turned sour.


 


Tony frowned as he got a missive on his phone, looking up as Harry joined him from where he had been talking to Vanessa, ""what has you frowning like that?""


 


Tony's face turned even sour, ""in an effort to gather everyone that is able to fight against Thanos, they are releasing Rogers and Romanov - on probation - for the sole purpose of this fight. Should they prove themselves there might be talks about lessening their sentences.""


 


Harry grinded his teeth, ""while I agree that every abled man and woman is welcome, I don't like mr. Righteous to be on the field, nor do I want a spy watching my back.""


 


Lookin at James as he passed, Harry sighed, ""and there is James to consider.""


 


As if summoned, the man made a beeline to them, ""I thought I heard my name.""


 


Harry and Tony nodded, looking at each other, before the Brit explained what it was that they were informed of. 


 


James paled at that, but gathered himself, ""I can deal. I don't want him near me, but I'll deal with it anyway. The more people who stand against Thanos the better, I know that, it just isn't comforting that they are willing to let criminals enter the playing field.""


 


Harry nodded, ""I'm sure Wade and Logan are more than willing to keep the man away from you, should you ask.""


 


James smiled slightly, and went to look for both men, telling them what had been said and seeing both men glaring in the direction of the counsel's helicopter that was no doubt transporting the unwanted into their midst. But they too would deal, the threat they were facing was more severe than any of the grudges they held against the people arriving.


 


Talking about arrivals, Clint just came through a portal followed closely by Pepper, Remus and Dora - all three who made Harry blanch at seeing them here. 


 


Shaking his head he approached them, to which his uncle took him aside.


 


""You can't keep us away this time, cub. We have just as much of a right to be here as all the others. We can't just stand idle as this happens; we already did so once - at least in Dora and my case.""


 


Harry bit his lip, ""but Teddy?""


 


Remus sighed, ""knows what might happen, but knows that we won't be able to sit this one out. He has the other boys and Andy there with him. As well as various other people; either from Asgard or the families of those gathering here. He'll be fine, just as we will be.""


 


Harry frowned, but seeing the determined look in their eyes, the same look he knew he and Tony sported, as well as anyone else that had gathered here or was preparing for the confrontation ahead, he knew he couldn't ask any of them to stay on the side lines.


 


He hugged his uncle close, ""at least promise me you'll be careful. And you'll go back to the tower once it gets too dangerous to stay here.""


 


Remus nodded, ""I promise, now go deal with Rogers and Romanov.""


 


Looking up he could see that the heli from the counsel had landed, letting Rogers and Romanov enter the field, with to his surprise Nick Fury and Phil Coulson following suit. Seeing as both men had believed Death until not that long ago, he was quite shocked and a little mad that he didn't know about this.


 


But he shook his head, with Vanessa not telling them about this, it probably was something that happened in every universe and was as such one of the key happenings - making it something that she couldn't tell about, as it couldn't change.


 


""Agent Coulson, Director Fury.""


 


Both men looked up and nodded as he approached, Tony not far behind.


 


""Lord Black, what is it we're up against?""


 


Harry tilted an eyebrow, ""you don't know?""


 


Nick shook his head, ""they didn't see fit to inform us, only that we'd be helping with an invasion of something. I tried reaching out to my brother, but he is still pissed at me.""


 


Harry grinned at that, after the whole fallout with SHIELD, he had told Kinglsey exactly what had caused such a thing to happen. After his reign as Ministry of Magic, the man had stayed in the Ministry and served as Hermione's prime advisor. To say he was pissed was an understatement. 


 


""You should know better than to betray a Lord of higher rank, Nick, Kingsley was willing to do a lot of things to make sure the alliance between house Potter and house Shackbolt wasn't broken after the stunt you pulled.""


 


Nick winced at that, while others just looked on fascinating as to what was happening.


 


Harry shook his head, ""enough about that though. The gist is that the same person responsible for the invasion in 2012 is coming here himself. After destroying Asgard, he had his eyes on Earth for the fact that something he seeks is kept here.""


 


Rogers, still not that smart it appears, asks if they can't just give him what he wants.This gatherers him quite a number of looks that ask him without words if he is stupid.


 


Stephen is the one that answers, ""no we cannot, as he is gathering infinity stones. As soon as he has all of them, who knows what would be possible. If he used them, and can use them, he will be able to reshape the entire universe, and possibly the multiverse, to his own will.""


 


It is Loki that contributes a bit more, ""his goal is to wipe out half of the universe, and seeing as going from planet to planet and killing half of its population is taking too long, he thinks to have found a shortcut in using the infinity stones as one snap of his finger will reduce the universe in half.""


 


Harry rolled his eyes as Rogers opened his mouth again, saying; ""don't bother, either you help us in the invasion ahead, or you go back to your cell. You've already shown how little you know and are willing to learn. Just follow orders and stay, or get the hell out - this will get ugly real fast.""


 


The man, seemingly not giving up, opened his mouth again, but no one heard what he had to say. His lips moved, but no sound seemed to come out of it.


 


A voice drawing from behind him, ""didn't your mother ever teach you if you can't say something useful, or nice, don't say anything at all.""



Harry's eyes widened again as he recognized the voice that spoke from behind Rogers, turning so fast that he almost got a whiplash from the movement, he gaped at the blond that strode towards him with a grace he always had. 


 


""Lucius.""


 


The man nodded his head, ""Harry, Draco wanted to come, but he is needed at Minister Granger's side, so Cissa and I offered to come over to make sure you had enough people backing you.""


 


He looked down his nose at Rogers who was ranting and raving under the silencing spell, ""it would seem that you might need it.""


 


Harry blinked, ""where is Cissa?""


 


Lucius gave a small smile, ""she's staying with Andy, to make sure there are enough medics on standby for when this does blow up. Plus, she seemed certain that we'd be enough of a cavalry.""


 


At that, Harry noticed Nick Fury's paler face looking at someone. That someone seemed to be his brother. Harry beamed up at Kingsley when the man was done glaring at his squib brother, his whole demeanor doing a 180 as he hugged Harry close and was seemingly-mad at not having gotten an invitation to the wedding.


 


As soon as Kingsley let him out of his embrace, Harry blinked again at the sudden appearance of so many redheads on the field. He sighed, he should have known that the Weasleys would come out and stand with him and their sister.


 


The only one missing was Ron, who had opted to stay with his wife in England. Understandable, as he was the chief strategy officer of the Britain Ministry, so very much needed there. Soon enough, after all this is over and done with they could all celebrate together.


 


For now, he was just happy with the amount of people that were either showing up at the compound, or checking in from the different cities they lived in. Coming together to deal with this threat they were all facing, but also who they could deal with by working together.


 


Tony took a hold of his hand from where Harry had introduced his husband to those the man had not yet met. They had sent out a few invitations when they did marry, but in all they kept it small and simple. Which was the main reason they had been able to keep it out of the press.


 


""I think we'll be fine with whatever Thanos has in store for us.""


 


Loki, who came to stand by them, with Stephen not far behind, nodded at that, ""I think you might have a point there. This is one large army against the Mad Titan. If we're lucky and the other realms spread that there is a planet willing to stand against Thanos, we might have help out of a surprise corner. But this is not something I know for sure, we might get it, and we might not.""


 


Harry nodded, ""we'll be able to take him, Thanos isn't the problem, it is getting to him that will be. Especially going by the fleet he has amassed around himself - should we not be able to deal with that this still will all be for nothing.""


 


That last, he made sure, was said in a silencing spell. No need to alarm those that were skittish for whatever reason, or to give Rogers any more ammunition to use in an effort to try and gather support from the people running around. Some of them are still caught up in the hero worship of getting to fight alongside Captain America.


 


The jet carrying the X-men, as well as Magneto and a couple of people from the brotherhood descended onto the field. This team of X-men would be the last of those that were gathering at the compound - and as such the real struggle would begin.


 


Tony and Harry made sure to greet Charles and Erik when they came out of the jet, waving at the others that came with them and took places among the others in the field. Even if people like Colossus and Kurt - or nightcrawler - got some weird looks. Even with all the changes, and the overview of the Council on all of this, there still was a certain prejudice against overly different enhanced - as some mutants tended to be.


 


Charles hissed at one point, ""they are entering the atmosphere. I had one of the more farsighted enhanced keep an eye out. They just contacted me that she had just seen the ship coming into our atmosphere.""


 


Harry and Tony exchanged looks, before they both put in an earbud, the same one that had been given to everyone in the alliance, as well as the newly arrived Asgardians. Tapping it once it lid up slightly, before Harry spoke.


 


""Can everyone hear me?""


 


Those close to him just nodded, while others - even on the other side of the world - let him know that he was coming through loud and clear. He gave a thumbs up to Tony - even if the other man had also heard the response. They were both beaming at the fact that their long distance communications were working and as such able to communicate worldwide as Thanos started his attack.


 


""This is Harry Black, I just got confirmation that the Mad Titan is entering the Earth's atmosphere. Stand-by for further information as to where they plan on attacking first - as we hope he gets drawn to us in the first place.""


 


Several other nations, among them Wakanda and England, let them know they could see the ships in the sky, even if there was no sight of them also landing or attacking right now.


 


Harry sighed, ""then we wait.""


 


---



They didn't have to wait long, before almost all major cities around the world let them know that a ship had landed just outside of the city in question, disembarking beings that wasted no time in attacking everything in their path.


 


Teams were deployed to help deal with the threat, even if places like the capital of Wakanda, and Tokyo dealt with the threat on their own, some others like in Brussels, Copenhagen and Abu Dhabi, the extra help was more than appreciated.


 


Harry, Tony, Charles, Erik and Loki stayed on sight accompanied by the wizard delegation, Rogers and Romanov, for the main reason of having a backing if they were to suddenly appear at the compound. Those last two had to stay as no one trusted them to have their back. 


 


None of them, especially those that knew a bit about Thanos, either from experience or because of what Vanessa had told them, were aware that the being would try something so underhanded. He believed he was claiming what rightfully belonged to him, because the Infinity Stones were trying to deceive him in believing that.


 


All of them were also glad that Rogers was still silenced, as it had taken James coming back from helping in Brussels, that the man had noticed his revered best friend being there. It made all of them roll their eyes, even more so when he tried to approach and found himself bouncing back from a force field.


 


Harry, after seeing the man keep on trying, said; ""restraining order, remember Rogers. You can't come within 30 feet of James, so don't keep on trying. Or do, it will give us all something to laugh about.""


 


The man had glared at him, before going back to trying to get to James. The other WWII vetran had just rolled his eyes, before going back to the conversation he had been having with Logan, Wade and Victor.


 


---


 


Their peace was soon disrupted as most of the people on the comms let them know that the major cities had been cleared and the fights won with a minimum of casualties. The first few battles were in their favor.


 


It was also Harry's gut feeling, and fast thinking that made him able to throw up a widespread shield to fend off the attack that came from the ship that had been sneaking up on them. It's stealth mode fell away as a part of the blast was redirected onto itself.


 


As soon as he had the shield up, he could feel Loki and Stephen's magic adding to his own to be able to keep the blast from hitting them. Which left them occupied for the footsoldiers that entered within the perimeter around the compound.


 


Thanos, as they had expected, had been searching for them, in stealth mode. Trying to make sure that those that had thwarted him, and those that had escaped him would perish at his own hand. Or at least in the possibility that he could see it all happening.


 


As the mages of the group held up the shield, Harry could soo Tony, Rhodey and Pepper (and hadn't that been a surprise) rise up into the sky in their suits. Keeping aerial attacks at bay while the others engaged those that came at them on foot. Someone must have also been farsighted enough to let the others know that Thanos was here, and that the majority of his ships were only now becoming visible.


 


The attacks on the major cities now obviously a way to gauge if that was where they were hiding, as well as the perfect way of culling, or trying to cull, the population of Earth.


 


The wizarding delegation took up positions around the mages keeping up the shield so the ray from the mothership wouldn't decimate all of them in one attack. They would keep approaching forces away from those that had the best chances of covering for them from whatever Thanos threw at them.


 


The moment the ray from the mother ship ceased, they let down the shield they were holding, joining into the fray with their allies to stop the Mad titan from accomplishing his goal. Right now, the only one close were the Space Stone and the Time stone. One was stored in Loki's dimensional pocket, while the other was in plain sight on Stephen's neck.


 


---



Harry took great pleasure in accosting the one who looked like a failed Squidward, Loki telling him the being was calles Ebony Maw, known for his sadistic pleasure in torturing the people or being that Thanos took onto his ship. Either to make them into puppets; like Loki had been, or to persuade them to join them in their mad quest (which in the end did seem like the better choice against all the torture they were subjected to).


 


The being hissed at him, only making the Master of Death smirk all the more, he knew he was more powerful and more able than the mage in front of him. His powers were born out of malice and backward thinking. They were not born with him, as Harry's magic was, nor was it a gift, like the powers and title that came with the Master of Death.


 


Ebony Maw could see this, and was starting to see just how outclassed he was against Harry. His actions were becoming more and more erratic, while his magic was becoming sloppy and predictive. The perfect chance to get one up.


 


If not for the fact that Rogers chose this moment to come in between, all the while Thanos must have sensed something as he attacked - obliterating his own mage to try and harm Harry. Which didn't help when Rogers tried to step out of the picture at that moment, attacking Thanos as if this was your regular villain.


 


The sound the supersoldier body made as it was slammed back into a wall of the compound didn't sound all that good, nor did it sound like Rogers would get up anytime soon. 


 


But it left Harry distracted, for as much as he didnt like Rogers, he hadn't deserved that. No one deserved that. 


 


He ducked under the hit of Thanos' spear/battle axe hybride. Feeling the air moving around him as he only just managed to dodge. The Mad Titan, for all that he was mad, did move quickly and with the intention to kill.


 


Their final battle had begun.



Harry frowned, trying to keep away from the battle axe/spear thing that Thanos was wielding, the Mad Titan sporting a mad grin on his face. So he most likely had an idea just who Harry was, and like so many before him thought that defeating Harry would mean that he could claim the title that was Harry's.


 


He tried to keep an eye on the people behind him, as such knowing that Loki and Stephen were dealing with Ebony Maw, keeping the alien sorcerer at bay and slowly chipping away at his defences in a way that Harry had done.


 


It might not be totally fair to gang up on the being two to one, but none of them could care less. This was the reason that so many others had followed Thanos, having been broken by magical means by this very being so the Mad Titan would have cannon flodder a plenty.


 


It was obvious in the way that some of the foot soldiers that came by them, that they weren't totally there anymore. Nothing more than puppets for Ebony Maw, while their soul had already been broken or departed the body after whatever it had been through.


 


It angered Harry to know that these criminals were allowed to keep going from planet to planet to enact Thanos's delirious plan of saving the universe by exterminating half of it. Even more crazy was the fact that in doing so, he would gain the favor of Lady Death - if anything he had gained her ire for the extra work he gave her by doing this.


 


He frowned when the Mad Titan suddenly stopped his attack and looked up at the sky, towards where Tony was hovering dealing with the leviatan beings that were released from the ships still high above in their atmosphere.


 


Harry's eyes widened as he noticed the guns on the main ship directing their rays onto the Iron Man. Even if Tony was the Merchant, Harry knew that after being hit the man would need time to heal and that was time they didn't have. He had a shield thrown up before he could think about it, bouncing the rays back and destroying one of the ships.


 


However, by doing that, he had taken his eyes off of the Mad Titan, which had been exactly what the alien wanted. And opening in Harry's otherwise imperdible shield, and going after his husband had been the perfect way.


 


He almost wanted to close his eyes, knowing that this was a hit that would mortally wound him - if he were anything else than the Master of Death - and would take him out of the fight for a moment too long.


 


However, the hit that he had been expecting never came. A shimmering shield in front of him, the Mad Titan trying to get through, to take advantage of his distraction to still deal a blow to the British born, but not managing to do so.


 


Looking around, Harry noticed no one of the others was even paying attention to him, to protect him from the blow that was directed at him. All of them busy with dealing with the army invading - even with the extra support they were getting from the cities that had dealt with their attackers, it still didn't make sense for the shield to be there.


 


Until he heard her, 

""I cannot help you, but I am not losing you and neither are you. They wish to fight for their home as well, even if they are not part of it anymore.""



 


Blinking, Harry concentrated on the space in front of him, about two meters from where Thanos was standing, and started to see them standing there. Keeping a shield going now that they were part of the very world around them and thus unlimited in their magical powers.


 


Which was quite a shock as these men had been known as some of the strongest the Wizarding World had to offer in the last few centuries.


 


Harry started to laugh as he noticed what was going on, and that Thanos was also noticing the three men in front of him.


 


""Give up, Thanos, this is Lady Death's way of helping in a way that she doesn't have to come here herself. You want to deal a blow to the universe in delivering her half of its souls. She's telling you to stop bulshitting by giving those already passed a way to help us defeat you.""


 


As he said this, the three men in front of him became corporal, much to the shock of those that were British born and raised. After all, they were all familiar with Tom Riddle - and just who he became, as well as Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald.


 


While two out of the three were men Harry never suspected would come to his aid, he welcomed the help with both hands. It would seem that they needed all the help they could get - something that Lady Death - Vanessa - agreed with, as she lifted the veil separating their world and the Afterlife.

Lucius knew that something was going on when the spot that had been marked with the Dark Mark started to tingle, but he was too busy dealing with the elf-like being that was attacking him. She seemed to be in full control of her actions, and as such most likely one of the children of Thanos.


 


When she grazed his side and he cried out, he dropped to a knee, seeing her ready for her next attack that he wouldn't be able to dodge.


 


Only to hear a voice he didn't expect to hear to yell 'secrumsempta' cutting the woman almost diagonally in half. Killing her and saving his life.


 


Turning, he couldn't believe the sight he was treated to, ""Severus.""


 


His friend, and his only son's godfather gave a small smile back, ""Lucius, it is... good to see you.""


 


Lucius opened and closed his mouth a few times, before sighing, ""Potter I presume.""


 


Severus nodded, ""with a little help from Lady Death, she lifted the veil to allow us to help those we left behind when he passed. I know My Lord, Albus and Grindelwald are assisting Harry from where he let himself be distracted as they attacked his husband.""


 


Lucius opened and closed his mouth a few more times, before shaking his head, ""I should have known the Potter luck would make an appearance here. Even if I didn't expect Lord Voldemort or Grindelwald to appear in his defence.""


 


Severus shrugged, ""Death is very different than what we expected it to be, but it lets those passing the veil think about their actions and try to redeem themselves from them. The fact that Harry did so much good for the world, and even strived to let it be known that it was never his fault (totally at that) for the way he turned out, endeared him to all three of them.""


 


Lucius laughed at that, before turning his back to Severus as a new load of mindless puppets came at them from a new ship that had dropped close to where they were standing. Just like the old days, they started their counter attack, feeling some others cover their blind spots and grinning as if it was the Lestrange brothers. It was good to see his friends again, even after everything that happened a part of him hated that he never got to say goodbye to them.

In England multiple people gasped as he ghost in the castle became corporal again, joined by all of those  that lost their life in the defence of England, the castle itself or for the betterment of the Wizarding World (even if this meant that they had lost the last war, or the one before that) in their eyes they could help the world right now, to see the changes that had been made would prosper.


 


Dark and Light witches and wizards ran around together to protect what was once their own school and its students, so they might know a World without war. This went beyond Dark vs. Light, and even Order of the Phoenix vs. Death Eaters, this was protecting the very universe from someone that wanted to destroy it.


 


Headmistress McGonagall had to cover her mouth when people like Colin Creevey, Cedric Diggory and Percy Weasley went out with their wands held high to keep the invading aliens at bay.


 


Former headmasters and teachers, even the founders themselves joined in this fight that if lost, would forever change the balance between life and death.


 


---


 


All over the world those already passed stood again, to fight together with the living against an invading army bent on killing them all off. While most of them didn't understand what was going on, they all were certain that this was not a fight they wanted to lose.


 


---


 


With Albus and Gellert covering them, Tom and Harry managed to get a hit on Thanos. The parseltongue spell meant that no normal means would be able to heal it - it was after all an ability that Harry, Tom and some people in a remote tribe in India could use. It was a strength that they could use to deal more blows.


 


Without the whole crazy aura Volemort had, Tom was a breeze of fresh air, letting Harry know just how amazing Tom Riddle could have been, had he been helped when he needed it instead of being pushed aside.


 


He gave a breathless chuckle when the other two wizards came close to the two youngest of the four of them. The shield was still holding from where they had put it up again.


 


""Harry, my boy.""


 


Harry looked at his former headmaster, shaking his head, ""whatever it is, Albus, it's been over and done with. I forgave you a long time ago and I don't plan on keeping a grudge now. I have much better things to do with my time.""


 


The eccentric wizard just looked at the youngest of the four of them, bowing his head a bit, before turning to Tom. The former Dark Lord also shook his head, ""whatever dealings we still had perished with me, with us. I don't like you and I doubt I ever will, but we're here for other things than to talk this all out, Albus.""


 


Grindelwald only patted Albus' hand before turning and releasing a nasty yellow spell into the arriving zombie troops, taking out more than half of them. Shrugging at them all looked at him, ""there was a reason they sent Albus after me in the 50's you know.""


 


Harry just chuckled and ran into the incoming forces, they all started coming faster and faster after eachother, letting them know that Thanos was calling his forces to the compound; to make sure that those he saw as an obstacle towards hi affections to Lady Death would be dealt with before he could kill off half of this planet too, and take the infinity stones they had.


 


He would find however, that Earth and humanity, wouldn't give up so easily. People might fall, but for now, with the veil let up, they got right up again and started attacking again. None of them wanted to let this man win from them, wanted to give this Mad Titan the means to reduce half the universe to ash.


 


---


 


Tony could only stare as Harry was first almost bisected by Thanos' weapon, before a shield sprang up between his husband and the Mad Titan. To see just who had come to their aide was something that had him staring, and laughing as he heard Vanessa telling him what she had done. 


 


They were winning this fight one way or another, there was no way that they were going to lose now.


 


---


 


Steve Rogers didn't know what had happened, only that he had been thrown away like a rag doll by the big and purple alien. No one came to check up on him, making him angry, he should at least get a medic. He was Captain America still, he deserved that respect.








With the obvious signs that he was losing this fight, Thanos tried to get his fleet to retreat and regroup. To come back for the Earth and its inhabitants on another day, when he was sure that whatever tactic he was using would bring him victory.


 


Of course, nothing ever went like that for the villains of a story, especially not for one that had brought the wrath of a Primordial Being - and a woman scorned - on his neck. So, while he wasn't able to interfere herself, she was able to give her Chosen the upper hand in making sure his plans didn't succeed.


 


The fact that when a couple of ships did try to retreat but found themselves blown to smitters by the converging alliance outside of the Earth's atmosphere was a sight to behold as well.


 


The words of Queen Frigga, as well as the accomplishments of the Iron Man, had reached far and deep into the universe. To such an extent even, that people from all over were willing to come to the aid of this relatively unknown planet. If only for the chance that Thanos and his forces would be defeated once and for all.


 


The Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as Captain Mar-Vell, had answered the call as soon as they heard it - in part to fight for their home planet, or the homeplanet of their captain against one of the biggest enemies the whole of the universe faced.


 


With the fact that he was fighting a losing battle, was losing his children and his zombie-like drones like flies, the Mad Titan knew that he wouldn't be able to return from Earth victorious. At every turn they were waiting to block him, be it by Death's Chosen, the resurrected fighters, or the already substantial force of the enhanced counsel, now added with the intergalactic alliance.


 


No one wanted to let Thanos live, not when it would mean the end of the universe as they knew it. Most of them probably wouldn't know, but Tony, Wade and Harry knew very well what had happened or might have happened in other dimensions, what was lost in the end in an effort to defeat the very alien in front of him.


 


Tony touched down close to where the group of powerful wizards was gathered, Wade popping up out of the crowd not long after. Taking a spot on either side of Harry, they nodded at Tom, Albus and Gellert - making the three of them take a step back, while Death's Chosen took a step forward.


 


Feeling as the world around them shifted as the forces of Thanos were eliminated.


 


Harry flicked his hand, revealing his scythe from where it was hidden as the Elder Wand in its holster. Wade and Tony both directed their weapons to the man, but kept their distance as Harry approached the now on his knees purple alien. The look in his eyes was enough to tell them that this was not how he had expected it to end. In fact, they were all sure that he assumed Earth's population to be weak and unprepared - giving him a chance to get to all the infinity stones that were kept here, bringing him closer to his endgame.


 


""Thanos of Titan, you have tried and failed to gather the infinity stones in a mad quest to conquer the universe in a mad attempt to win Death's favor by doing so. I can tell you that you aren't even close to winning her favor - not when you would disrupt and eventually kill this universe for your mad ideals.""


 


Harry looked down onto the Titan, ""she is unforgiving, and even in Death she won't allow you to rest in peace after all that you have done, or all that you would have done to realise these mad plans.


 


The infinity stones are not to be used by us mortals, they just are and should be left alone unless chosen by a stone to safeguard it. The fact that you were only willing to use them to further your own goals speaks of how little you know of these relics.""


 


The Titan's eyes betrayed that he knew where this was going, that he knew that this would be the end of him, and of his reign, he looked around until his eyes fell onto a green skinned and blue skinned woman, both of them striding towards his with purpose, but stopping just after Harry, Tony and Wade.


 


""You have a lot to answer for, and while a lot of your self-proclaimed children chose to die for your belief, there are those that found their own path in life, away from the path you set them on.""


 


He turned towards the two women, ""Nebula, Gamora, anything to add?""


 


The blue skinned woman sneered at Thanos, ""you were nothing more than my torturer, the reason I look like this and have half of my body replaced with metal and wires. The reason why as children we didn't get along - obviously, as you kept pitting us against one another. I will be happy to know you aren't here anymore and can't harm any children in the way that you harmed us.""


 


The green haired woman just looked down her nose at the Titan, before grasping her sister's hand and looking on in contempt as the man still tried to reach them, his hand outstretched as if asking for help, by two young women very unwilling to give it.


 


Before anything else could be said, the last of the ships were shot down and the last foot soldiers were killed - never to get up again. When this was done, Harry's scythe touched Thanos' still outstretched hand, making him disintegrate.


 


""I would say be at peace, but she won't let you have that - not after everything you have done.""


 


The whole world, and maybe even the whole universe, was watching as Thanos was defeated, left as dust to never bother them again. The cheer that broke out all around them was enough to let them know how happy everything was with this happening.


 


Which, of course, didn't last all that long as Rogers made his way towards Death's Chosen and the two alien women. Looking at the way the obviously deadly space assassins were dressed and looking very close to berating them for the way they were dressed.


 


He seemed to have grown somewhat of a brain however, or at least had Thanos shove it back into place when he was thrown into a wall, as he didn't say anything to them, just looked very disapproving.


 


When he came close to Harry, the Brit tilted an eyebrow, keeping himself in between Tony and Rogers, as he didn't trust the man with his husband. He didn't trust the man, period, and was not going to like whatever was going to come out of his mouth  by the way he was looking at the three of them.


 


""I don't get why you killed him. You should never resort to killing!""


 


Harry rolled his eyes, looking around and seeing most of the people around them looking at the Super Soldier like he was nuts. People like James, Logan and even Wilson - who had arrived sometime ago - were looking at the man like he was nuts, and like they couldn't believe he would say such a thing, when Thanos wouldn't stop at anything until the universe was halved.


 


Harry could also see several people on the phone, or talking into an earpiece, no doubt reporting to either a ruling body or the counsel on what had been going on here today. And most likely, about what Steve Rogers was sprouting after all of this, telling off their savior (twice over - not that everyone knew that) for doing what was right - and was asked by a power much stronger than any human could comprehend.


 


""Tell me again, Rogers, how did you build your reputation? Because I can assure you that those Nazi soldiers you fought also died sometimes.""


 


Rogers sneered, ""they deserved it, for wanting to take over the world.""


 


Harry rolled his eyes again, ""so was Thanos, in fact he wanted to take out half the universe, that seems like an even worse step. Did you not listen to the briefing you were given on the ride here, too absorbed in the fact that they asked you to fight - thinking that you would be needed to win this. And when you weren't the one to deal the final blow you were pissed at me, and Tony and Wade for getting that chance.


 


You are a hypocrite that thinks his way is the only way, leaving the rest of us stumped that you would scold someone for doing the exact same thing you would have done - but as you weren't the one who did it, it is wrong.""


 


Rogers tried to open his mouth, but Harry beat him to it, ""I don't even get why you're even here, you didn't even do anything for our side of the fight. You just ran in the way, and were knocked out for the major part of the fight.""


 


Rogers started to go red, but before he could say anything Coulson and Fury appeared, both men with a frown on their face. Glaring at the super soldier until he followed them back to the helicopter that was waiting for them - the counsel wasn't even remotely happy with him, and were regretting ever giving leave for the man to go and 'help'.


 


Romanov at least had been helpful in taking in the smaller fries, and keeping an eye on those people that needed it. One of the small mercies they had with fer spy background, she at least knew how to aid them while keeping to the shadows, and had at least proven her worth in the eyes of those she had slighted.


 


Harry, Tony and Wade looked on as Rogers was forcefully escorted to the heli, from the looks of it he was also getting the third degree from Coulson on how he had been acting, and how the counsel would now decide what would happen with him. Not that the odds were looking good.


 


Before they could reach the heli however, the very air behind the compound seemed to split open, revealing a spaceship not unlike the one they just won against, a very familiar figure standing in full view - which was also impossible, as he had just been vanquished. The glimpse they got of the world on the other side of the portal which was a wasteland like no other.


 


But what made a lot of them gasp, or even go green, was what he was holding in his hand. The closer the ship came, the more obvious it was that he was holding a head in his hand, Captain America's head to be precise.


 


This version of Thanos was also looking around, very obviously surprised by the very different group that was standing in front of him. The way his eyes lingered on Tony, Clint, Romanov and Wilson let them know he had encountered them before. Which was a relief in some ways, as they had lived at one point. However, the item in his hand made it obvious that the outcome for the them on the other side hadn't turned out so well.


 


Harry tried to connect with Vanessa, but couldn't get through to Lady Death, she was most likely still dealing with their Thanos and whatever the newly revealed Thanos was leaving behind.


 


Harry dared looking behind him, to see Rogers palling as he too realised what was in Thanos' hand, and the implications that brought along. He hummed, hoping that finally Rogers saw that not everything happened like he wanted it to go. This was a prime example of having it done his way, and paying the ultimate price for it.


 


Looking at Wade and Tony, Harry braced himself for the new fleet he could see appear behind Thanos, tapping his earpiece to let everyone know that there was a second wave incoming.



When Harry's voice sounded over the international speaker system, letting them all know that a second wave of invading forces was imminent more than one person hoped that this was over much sooner than the one before.


 


The casualties had been low, but a second wave would and could change that if they threw caution in the wind. They were not going to let their planet fall to the rule of a loner with a God complex (and in some way a daddy complex) but that didn't take away that they would have to fight once more.


 


Thanos, as they had found out, was a selfish being that seemed to think that by wiping out half of the universe, the other half would flourish. And maybe it will, but doing so would upset the balance enough that the universe might just as well collapse into itself - ending all life in it.


 


At least this was the explanation given to the counsel by Harry Black and Tony Stark, something that had been the starting point for all of them to start preparing so the Mad Titan wouldn't succeed. No one thought about asking the men how they knew about all this, not after the studies they could show that this would happen. Vanessa had been throughout with gathering evidence for her Chosen to help them prepare this universe for what was to come.


 


It still left all of them wondering however, how it was possible a second wave, and as soon as imagery was available, how a second Thanos was able to get here. The glimpse of the other universe only verified what had been said, and the head held in his hand told them that they had been right not to trust Captain America with this mission.


 


Back on the battlefield, everyone was on edge, even more so when they noticed the glove that this Thanos was wearing and the stones that were brightly shining in their hold.


 


Harry hissed through his teeth, after everything they had tried to do in an effort to make sure Thanos didn't get to the infinity stones, this Thanos came equipped with a full set. Something that would make their fight all the harder.


 


For all that infinity stones weren't made to be handled by mere mortals, they were known to go along with it until such a time their new host was disposable. Something which wasn't the case yet, it would seem.


 


Glancing towards his husband and their friend standing right in front of Thanos, Harry made a small movement with his head making the other two take a step back. Even if Tony did so reluctantly. 


 


""Thanos, what is it that you want?""


 


The Titan looked down his nose at what he perceived to be a mortal, before letting his eyes run over the people behind them. Some he recognized, some he did not, and some like Gamora and Nebula were double - as they had betrayed him before, or had to be sacrificed for the greater good of the universe. They might have the same fate waiting for them, should they behave like the ones he had disposed of.


 


As he lifted his hand, feeling that dealing with this quickly would be the best way of going at it. He didn't expect the mortal in front of him to grab a hold of the gauntlet and pull it off before tossing it to the man dressed in red who ran the other way with it, even going through a portal that the Sorcerer Supreme conjured, disappearing from  his line of sight.


 


The yell he let out, as well as the way he tossed the mortal in front of him aside made his troops advance, fighting to be able to get their master's treasure back to him. Even with the man dressed in red getting away, they would find him as soon as this obstacle was over won.


 


Most of the people on the battlefield, or watching a live feed of what was happening gasped as Harry was tossed aside just like that. The sound he made when he hit the ground made them fear he'd never get up and with none of them having any idea as to his enhancements they feared he would stay down now.


 


Tony didn't have time to check on Harry, not when the Mad Titan himself was on him before he realised what was happening, he braced himself and caught the spear-battle axe thing that he seemed to favour. Feeling the resistance as the Titan kept on pushing down on him, the grin on the alien's face was far too joyful to be anything but exciting for the fact that he could (maybe once again) kill him.


 


He wanted nothing more than to go and check on Harry, but wasn't able to do so, not without letting the Mad Titan have free reign on everyone behind him, and once they fell, onto the world as a whole. Which was something he wanted to avoid no matter the cost. Especially now that Wade was running with the infinity gauntlet - if they were able to keep Thanos and his army busy until such a time that Wade had gotten far enough away and made sure the stones went back to their own universe, they would have won either way.


 


For now, he just had to trust on Tom Riddle and Loki, both of who had run towards the spot Harry had fallen, they would protect him and give him time to recuperate and indeed necessary regenerate whatever had been hurt or broken by the hit he took.


 


""You can't win, Stark, you weren't able to do so before, and without Captain America to lead you, I am sure you won't be able to do so again.""


 


Tony sneered right back, ""you're mistaken if you think that Rogers is the only one capable of leading here, even more, if you think that any team under Rogers was the best Earth could give. We just dealt with one version of you, I'm sure we can deal with another.""


 


Given the speech Tony gave startled the Mad Titan, Tony and those around him deduced that this version of Thanos came from a place where the original Avengers had been much closer. And maybe in such a scenario a group led by Steve Rogers would be the strongest force on Earth, but here that wasn't the case.


 


In fact, Rogers hadn't stopped staring at the severed head of his counterpart of the other dimension, which had rolled all the way to the super soldier when Thanos let go of it to hit Harry away from him. Maybe now the man would finally realise that they were doing this for a reason and that in another universe he had been the leader he so desperately wanted to be here, this had been the outcome. The fact that no one else made their way from that universe to theirs was telling enough to the outcome for the Avengers there, they had been defeated and slaughtered.


 


James, with Rhodey and Pepper giving air support, had arrived at his side as soon as Tony managed to bring the alien off balance. All four of them knew that this was just an effort to get everyone as much time as possible. Wade to get away, and Harry to recover from what Thanos did to him. They needed to bide time, as much as possible, their world depended on it.


 


---


 


Wade only knew he made his way through Stephen's portal as far away from the fight as possible. He didn't like running, even less when Harry was most likely critically injured. But none of them had been able to get to Vanessa, not hear from her that everything was alright.


 


So, as soon as he had the gauntlet in hand, he ran, and kept on running, hoping that the others were able to hold Thanos off, and that none of his so-called children made it past all of them to get here. He needed to keep the stones out of Thanos' reach, no matter the cost.


 


And he needed to find a way to reach Vanessa, the sooner, the better, she would have never allowed the other version to cross over, if she had noticed it. But then again, something escaping Lady Death's notice meant something awful was going on somewhere else in the multiverse. He just hoped nothing was directly linked to Vanessa bringing back so many of the Death to fight for them.


 


He would never get over it, if Vanessa got hurt trying to help or protect them, she had much larger tasks to see to its end, not worry about them. They would be fine, or working towards getting fine. 


 


He shook his head, he needed to keep moving, he sadly didn't have the time to worry about his lover, even less so with the future of the Earth, once more, at stake. He needed to play keep away a little longer and give the others time to get the counter attack going.


 


---


 


Harry remembered the pain that exploded from his head downwards when he hit the ground as Thanos hit him away, swatting at him like he was a fly instead of a human. Had he been anyone else, he would have died, he knew for a fact that he had numerous fractures in his skull, neck and back - lethal if one wasn't immortal like he was.


 


He could also feel everything moving back into place, only this was even worse than that one time he jumped off the astronomy tower - then at least he had the time he needed to reassemble himself. Right now, he didn't have that time; Thanos was still out there with a fresh army, one that if they weren't prepared could overtake them at any point.


 


He could hear people approach, and hoped to Merlin and Morgana that they were allies, and not someone from Thanos' faction.


 


They might have been, but before they could come close, he could hear a voice yelling and a yelp of pain followed by Loki's voice right next to him.


 


""What do I need to do?""


 


Tom's voice sounded soon after, ""align his bones already, they'll reset, but it'll take longer if they have to pull themselves into their proper place. We need to make sure he needs as little time as possible to recover.""


 


Part of Harry wanted to ask Tom how he knew all this, but with what had been already said on the battlefield, he didn't doubt that the former Dark Lord had been keeping an eye on him. Wanting to follow the path his nemesis took after his passing, which would indeed enable the man to know just what needed to be done.


 


He could feel Loki moving around him, pulling and pushing certains bones back into alignment, after which they popped as his Death Magic healed the damage that was done to him. When his neck healed, he could speak again - his voice box had been damaged by the splintered bone.


 


""Turn me around.""


 


Loki looked startled, but did as asked, helping him turn over onto his back as he felt other, more superficial wounds heal themselves.


 


""Who is keeping Thanos at bay?""


 


Tom hummed, ""your husband, with some of his friends, with the sorcerer, Albus and Gellert on stand-by. Make sure you'll get healed for now, Potter, we can deal with all the rest later. I have no doubt that they will need you to win this battle again.


 


And let us hope Deadpool can keep away from Thanos and his forces long enough. The last thing we need is for him to be caught, and for Thanos to gain control of the infinity stones again.""


 


Harry nodded, slowly getting into a sitting position with Loki supporting his back. He looked around and could see people all over fighting once more against the army of Thanos. The only plus side to this all, was that Thanos didn't have an armada of ships at his disposal to attack elsewhere on Earth. He only had foot soldiers, and some of the leviathans.


 


""Help me up, we have an alien to deal with.""


 


Tom huffed, but pulled him upright, Loki at his back to support him in the event that he crumbled. When that didn't happen, the God took a step back.


 


""Let's go.""


Surprise! Have an early chapter, I will as promised, upload a second one after I am home from work. The last two will be uploaded next week!


Loki made sure to support Harry as he swayed just a bit on his feet, the last of the broken bones snapped back into place as he took his first few steps back towards the battlefield with Loki and Tom flanking him on either side.


 


The two other mages were keeping a close eye on him, which made it just a bit odd seeing as one of them had been his nemesis for most of his life - but seeing Tom here again, and knowing what had driven the man to madness made it very rewarding, and very interesting to see all that wiped away in death.


 


The man standing next to him was how Tom Riddle would have turned out without all the trauma that had scared him as a child and as a teen. That  coupled with the ambition to be great and the knowledge, later on, of his heritage, had twisted a brilliant young man into a Dark Lord feared all over Europe.


 


But now he was right here with the rest of them, fighting to protect their world from someone who wanted to destroy it. 


 


Tom huffed, ""I can feel you thinking all the way to here. Never guessed we'd meet again like this?""


 


Harry grinned sheepishly, ""can you blame me for thinking like that? After all, for the first 17 years of my life you were the bogeyman of the Wizarding world, someone who wanted to kill me no matter the cost. To see you like this, like it should have been makes me glad I dedicated that orphanage to you.""


 


Tom looked oddly touched at that, a soft smile on his face, ""I did like what you did to the place, and for what reason. Had there been a magical orphanage in my time things would have turned out very differently. I hope that with this, as well as all the changes in the wizarding world and the world in general there won't be a child treated like I was, not anymore.""


 


Harry nodded, ""that was the whole point behind all that, to make sure that no one - be they magical or enhanced - would need to grow up among people that don't understand what is going on. So they know that they are not alone in this, and it isn't something like being possessed or a freak ability that makes them like this, it's just who they are.""


 


Tom nodded, and out of the corner of his eye, he could see Loki nodding along to what they were saying. The man had also been an outcast on Asgard for choosing magic over fighting and learning to handle a weapon as his main choice of attack. It might not be totally the same, but the times Loki had come to Earth those topics had been discussed. They would also need to be addressed once the Asgardians settled here, or on some other planet, as those might just hold other customs.


 


Arriving at the more heated parts of the battle field, all three men fell silent as they approached the place Harry had been standing before. The same place where Tony, James and Rhodey were keeping the Mad Titan at bay - even if Tony was doing most of the heavy lifting, being the most durable for now.


 


While people were aware that they were enhanced, it was more known about Harry than it was about Tony, and especially with the way this version of Thanos had no idea just what they were, they wanted to keep that ace hidden for a little while longer.


 


The Mad Titan would be in for enough of a surprise when Harry showed up again, whole and healthy like he hadn't just been swatted away and had to realign his spine.


 


Tom looked at him, ""what's the plan?""


 


Harry grinned, ""hit them hard and make it hurt. Let them realise that whatever it was that they had in their aadvantage that made them win in their home dimension won't be the reason they win here. We're stronger together, just because of the common goal we all have - we can use that to win once again.""


 


As he was speaking, people from all over the world were announcing that they were making their way to the compound, and the state of New York, to make sure that Thanos and his army was dealt with. Stephen from where he could see the sorcerer was making sure that the people who let him know would get a portal in their vicinity to get through, all the while the Asgardians were close by to protect him from the invading army.


 


Harry grinned even wider, ""without the gauntlet we will have a chance at defeating the Mad Titan, a chance I want to take with both hands.""


 


He turned to his companions, ""you ready? We're going to free up James and Rhodey so they can go and give support elsewhere. Between the tree of us and Tony, I am sure we'll be able to take on whatever Thanos throws at us.""


 


Tom and Loki nodded, before they set a brisk pace towards the spot Tony was standing. Rhodey and James getting told over their coms that they would be relieved in just a moment, freeing them to go and give support on other sectors of the battlefield.


 


---


 


Tony could only smile when Rhodey and James pulled back, knowing from his altercations with this version of Thanos that the Mad Titan would think that they were giving up, and close to giving in. He would never suspect that Harry would be standing in front of him within moments to make sure that he too was stopped before anything else could happen.


 


""What is this Stark, giving up so soon. Your counterpart kept on fighting - on to the last second, until one of my chitauri ripped him apart limb for limb.""


 


Tony had to repress a shudder, to hear how this other version of him had met his end, how lost he must have felt and how devastated the people watching must have been. He knew the risks of becoming a superhero, something he was sure this other version had known too. But still, no one deserved an end like that.


 


""But I am not that version, this is a whole new dimension, one you made the mistake of trespassing into. You won't be leaving this alive.""


 


Thanos looked down at him, making Tony become aware of just how his other self had been ripped apart by this being and his army, but he wouldn't let that discourage him. Harry would be here soon with more powerful backup than Thanos could conjure - especially without the reality stone - they would be fine and making sure their dimension was saved, and the other one was avenged.

Further down the battlefield people from all over were working together to stop the army that was still trying to make their way past them to go look for Wade, or Deadpool, in an effort to get Thanos' gauntlet back. Which of course, wasn't something they were going to let happen. Not when they had already won once against this same alien and this same army - once more was within their grasp.


 


It brought all of them courage to keep on fighting, even after the events just before, what had been done once, could be done again. This time with back-up from all over the world arriving to give them a hand.


 


Those that were familiar with the Lord Black also knew that he would be up and running in no time, telling others that the man - even as a teen - didn't have a habit of staying down, and wouldn't start on that anytime soon.


 


Severus, Lucius, Rodolphus and Rabastan were making sure that some of the injured were able to be transported to STARK tower without any of the aliens hitching a ride along. They weren't going to let these creatures get to NEw York City - or any major city - when contained they would be so much easier to deal with.


 


For Lucius it was as if his friends had never left him, like they were still teens looking for their way in life and having each other to lean on.


 


""This sure brings back memories, does it not.""


 


Looking at his son's godfather, Lucius couldn't help but nod, he had missed Severus and had always been saddened by the fact he didn't get to say goodbye. Something lessened when after Draco started working on the cabinet of Minister Granger, he found out just how far Harry Potter had gone to clear Severus of all charges and to make sure that the man would be seen as one of the greatest potions masters in history, as well as an official headmaster of Hogwarts.


 


To be here fighting alongside a man he had come to respect and who in the end had been just what the Wizarding World, and the World as a whole needed, was an amazing experience and one (although he hoped that wasn't the case) he wouldn't think twice about giving his life for.


 


He was certain that everyone present here today was willing to give their life for this cause - even the deceased that came back alive would sacrifice themselves for those that were still alive, if only for the fact that they still had a life to live. He knew this for certain as both Lestanges and Severus had jumped in front of deadly attacks that they could take and literally walk off, while it would mean the end of him.


 


---


 


Thanos did indeed do a double take when he noticed Harry getting closer again, the British born wizard was advancing at an alarming speed, one not hindered whatsoever by anyone that stood in his way. Either by a spell he himself cast, or by a spell cast by one of his fellow mages, those on Thanos' side fell like flies as the three made their way to stand next to Tony.


 


Looking slightly back to see Gellert and Albus keeping the other at bay with a large perimeter spell that would only allow those they willed to pass - such as Harry, Tom and Loki - while keeping out all the others - mainly Thanos' forces.


 


This was also something the Mad Titan hadn't taken into account with the way his glare was directed to the oldest mages among them. Both who had faced down bigger foes (namely their ex-lover) so an alien with illusions of grandeur was nothing. It wasn't like he could hurt them when they were already dead.


 


But here he was, the famous Mad Titan, isolated from his army and up against the Merchant of Death, the Master of Death, the God of Mischief and the most powerful Dark Lord the world had seen in centuries. He didn't stand a chance in hell to come out of this, something he seemed to be releasing when all four of them released the hold they had on their magic.


 


Soon the army would be dealt with, of this they were certain, all that rested was the Mad Titan himself.


 


---


 


Wade stopped running for a little while again, he hadn't heard anyone close by in an hour or two, so was certain he was alone. And even if he wasn't he didn't fear for his life, as nothing he had encountered so far was capable of killing him.


 


The only thing, or person, capable of doing so would only do so when he asked for the sweet release of Death. Only to be enclosed into her embrace until the end of time, as there was no way he would leave Vanessa behind after everything they had been through.


 


Wanting to try and contact her, he asked aloud, ""Vanessa?""


 


Hoping that this time she would answer and whatever had been bothering her, or keeping her occupied, would be dealt with. The Thanos that had appeared here had been in breach with so many rules Primordials were there to safekeep - plus it would give her a chance to deal with the creep herself.



Wade almost couldn't help his sigh in relief when cold started to surround him, before arms wrapped around his waist and he sacked back just a bit against Vanessa from where she pressed her cheek to his back.


 


""I was a bit worried there, My Lady.""


 


She sighed, ""I know, but an entire universe just collapsed on itself even when there was no one there anymore. It startled all of us and took a long time to make sure that whatever happened there wouldn't branch out to neighbouring universes.""


 


Wade hummed, ""that can't be a coincidence.""


 


As he said that, he turned and showed the Primordial Being what he was carrying in his arms.


 


""That's an infinity gauntlet.""


 


Wade nodded.


 


""This universe didn't have an infinity gauntlet.""


 


Wade nodded again, a grim look on his face as he could see Vanessa's face change as she came to the same conclusion.


 


""That Thanos came here? Wielding an infinity gauntlet? How did you get it off of him?""


 


""Yeah, gave us all a scare when he was suddenly standing here, that same damn smirk on his face as the one we just defeated. When you didn't answer any of us, we knew something big was going on. We just needed to keep him busy.""


 


He took a deep breath, ""Harry managed to get it off and give it to me, Doctor Strange opened a portal so I could get to the whole other side of the Earth then where Thanos and his new army was gathering.""


 


He winced, ""last that I saw, Thanos swatted Harry to the side, the sound that came from his body coming down wasn't nice to hear. I am sure that if he weren't the Master, he would have died.""


 


Vanessa winced and rubbed her chest, making Wade realise that she did feel it each and every time they died. He had wondered about that for a while now especially seeing as he did die quite a few times already. As the Primordial Being of Death she knew when people died, but the three of them were special in that case.


 


""So that's what I felt, Harry died again for a moment. I'm happy he isn't so prone to doing that anymore - there was a time before when he died too many times to count, since he and My Merchant have found each other it has decreased exponentially - for which I am glad. It just surprised me, even if he is the one out of the three of you who is able to regenerate the fastest.""


 


Wade hummed, ""it's because he's the Master of Death, is it not? He is on the same level as you are - Tony and I, we were chosen because of what we represented for you - a lover and someone willing to bring Death to those that wronged the people or Earth as a whole - he might not like what his weapons did, but they were effective in what they did.""


 


Vanessa just hummed, looking into the direction Wade guessed was the state of New York in the USA, he couldn't be sure of course, as he was certain Stephen had zapped him to the other side of the globe to make sure Thanos, nor the man's minions were able to get to him.


 


She looked down at the gauntlet in his hands, ""now I understand how that universe was able to just fall apart. After all, their infinity stones are gone and stopped supporting that version of what might have happened.""


 


She looked in the distance, ""not that it was such a pleasant fate for all those involved to begin with.""


 


Wade nodded, ""we all noticed, when that version of Thanos appeared with Rogers head in his hand. I think most of the battlefield, as well as the people following on the live stream were shocked to see that this would happen - or could happen - if they let Rogers lead them into battle.""


 


Vanessa nodded, ""as I stated before, no one was alive anymore. It was a wasteland - nothing could grow or evolve, they stagnated and were just broken down into nothingness. Something I am glad happened only after every living thing was destroyed or taken with Thanos when he came here.""


 


Turning to Wade, she grinned, ""but as he changes universes and brings the balance of this world in peril, I am allowed to interfere, to of course keep the order and make sure this universe doesn't befal the same fate as the one I just came from.""


 


Wade snorted, ""and the fact that you can kick the great purple raisin's ass had absolutely nothing to do with it?""


 


Vanessa looked at him with a secretive smile on her face, ""of course not, I am here to keep an eye on the balance, love, he's disturbing it. I am well within my right to interfere now.""


 


Her eyes rested on the gauntlet, ""but we won't be needing that anymore, this universe already has its own infinity stones, more and it will be perilous for a whole other reason.""


 


Waving her hand, a portal or wormhole thing appeared under Wade's hand, the mercenary dropped the gauntlet in it, happy to be rid of it. Certain that Thanos, nor his army, could try anything now. They wouldn't be able to get to their infinity stones, and getting theirs back would be an impossible feat.


 


Extending his arm, he looked at his lover, ""shall we join the fight, My Lady?""


 


Letting out a delightful laugh, Vanessa hooked her arm into his and conjured up another portal back to the battlefield, letting her Master and her Merchant know that she was on her way to assist in taking down the idiot that tried to give her - had already given her - so much work.


 


---


 


Harry could feel a brush of something on his mind, the slight chill he had always associated with Vanessa accompanying it, letting him know that she was seeking access to his mind, even if she could just enter she had never done so - respecting his privacy too much to just invade it, unless it was an emergency.


 


Opening up his mind, he was relieved to feel her once again, they had all been worried something had happened to the Primordial Being, and the chance of that happening brought about implications none of them wanted to think about.


 


But to feel her presence and to know that she was on her way made him grin for an entirely different reason. After all, they had been so focused on keeping Thanos at bay, in part because of her - as they wanted to make sure the Mad Titan never considered her showing up as a way of her reciprocating his 'feelings'. Now, however, this version of Thanos had come here to take over this universe and leave his own to disappear.


 


This Thanos had already changed his goal, otherwise he wouldn't be here, and as such, Vanessa appearing wouldn't be anything but the Titan's doom. 


 


Turning his grin to the Mad Titan in question, the alien looked at him with a sneer still not believing that even though he rose from the dead, he was an actual threat. But then again, he didn't know that about 40% of the people standing in front of him, or against him were already dead, and had only returned to deal with him and his army.


 


Seeing the grin unnerving him, Harry knew he just had to keep it going for a little while, those around him - namely his husband, best friend and former nemesis who he did at one time share a mind link with - could make up that something was about to happen. Tony, having felt Vanessa's touch just the same and realising that she was arriving any moment now, started grinning alongside the Brit. He was looking forward to Thanos' face when faced with Lady Death herself.


 


After exchanging looks, both Tony and Harry snorted, only grinning wider as the chill that mostly accompanied Vanessa started to creep in. Footsteps started to sound around them, as if an army was marching towards their location.


 


Tony and Harry were well aware of what was going to happen, after all, Wade must have found her while he was running, and with both of them loving their dramatics they were choosing to play this out in their favor.


 


Exchanging looks with the other two mages, all four of them took a step back when a portal opened up between them, the chill spreading even further as their breaths became visible. For some reason it gave Harry some minor flashbacks to all the encounters he had with dementors, even if this was a whole different kind of chill and he knew that Vanessa's powers would never be able to harm him. Nor would he react to this as severely as he did to dementors. No, this was all a show to let the Mad Titan know that he had lost before anything had even started.


 


When she did appear, it was in all her glory - not in the lovely and pleasant visage of Vanessa, but in the cold and all-knowing one of Lady Death, complete with her own scythe, the dark cloak and even a skeletal hand keeping a hold of the weapon she wielded. She stopped in between the two pairs of men already present, Wade just behind her at her side, with Harry coming to stand next to her and Tony just a step behind him.


 


Behind Tony and Wade; Tom and Loki conveigned, giving Thanos a very unified view from one he had longed for - or was said to long after - as well as those in her favor currently. The man seemed to realise that something was going on here that he would have never been able to forsee.


 


He was after all well aware of Lady Death, and knew how to recognize her, most likely did recognize her from the way his eyes almost bulged out of his head at the sight of her standing next to these mortals as if it was her favourite place in the world (and for those that knew her, it was). Totally at ease with being she could blink out of existence with just a snap of her fingers, should she so choose.


 


Death grinned at the Mad Titan, ""what is wrong Titan, after all that you have done to get my attention, it seems as if you don't want it anymore. If anything, you seem to be angry at the fact I choose to spend my time with mortals at my side, instead of at your side.""


 


As he opened his mouth to reply, she cut him off, ""there is no mortal out there that can tempt me, Titan, and no mortal that can dream of me by their side.""


 


She looked at her chosen few, and smiled, ""of course, there are those exceptions to the rule, such as those who I deemed my Chosen, or those that have been in some way linked to me in their life or their afterlife.""


 


Thanos seemed to realise that the men around her were more than he realised. He knew Loki was of Asgard, but other than that, he had no idea how he could be linked to Lady Death. The three mortals, one who arrived with Her and two who he knew returned from the dead, and one he again had no idea of how he was connected to Her, once again.


 


Death grinned only wider, looking at the Titan, as well as the people of Earth who were keeping a close eye on the proceedings in what was once protected by a force shield - now taken down seeing as the Titan's forces had been wiped out by their alliance.


 


""There are those chosen by me, either by their legacy - who is known as a Goddess of Death"", as she said this she mentioned to Loki, who bowed slightly, ""there are those who feared and revered me enough to mention me in their newly chosen name, and when their time did come, came with me quietly to enjoy their peace"", she mention to Tom, whose moniker appeared above him, 'Vol de Mort'.


 


Finally, she extended her hand to her lover, gazing upon him with loving eyes, ""there is my Champion who fought for me, even when he didn't know he did, and was rewarded for it.""


 


Extending her other hand to Tony and Harry, the couple laid their entwined hands into her free one, ""there is my Merchant, who gained my favor for never fearing Death when it was brought upon him, and who in turn made sure that those that deserved it met with me. For that he was rewarded.


 


And My Master, the one to collect all the hallows and walk towards his dead like one walks towards an old friend - one who had been my companion in times I didn't even know what to do, and was rewarded for that too.""


 


She turned towards Thanos again, ""those that seek me, never find me, but those that live their lives will find me eventually and join me in the Afterlife. You however, Titan, went out of your way to seek me, in such a measure that it consumed you and let other entities consume you in turn. Only those who have found themselves again are given access to the afterlife, which you will be denied - as nothing of yourself remains after all these years. I erase you, invader, and hope no one else rises, foolish enough to attempt what you have done.""


 


With a wave of her hand, the Titan fell apart in little particles and just floated away, absorbed back into the universe he was so eager to destroy.



Thanos it would seem did know that he had lost just seeing none of his army still standing when the barrier Albus and Gellert had been holding up was taken down. Out of everyone that had invaded, he was the last one standing.


 


When Lady Death started her speech, he seemed to know that this was inevitable and whatever happened now would be the end of him, and his conquest. After all, a Primordial Being wasn't to be trifled with, not even by one who had started out seeking her favour.


 


When she waved her hand and he started to dissemble, it was almost like a kind of relief was seen on his face, that it was finally over and done with - even if it didn't end in his favour, it did end.


 


The group of very remarkable people that had gathered to help fight Thanos, be they from Earth themselves, or answering the call they had tried to send out - some had even come from the whole other side of the universe - stayed quiet for just a moment. After all, last time they had started cheering right after their victory another adversary had presented itself.


 


Out back, someone did started cheering when nothing else happened, the joy and just the relief at knowing this was all over made its way through the crowd, and even around the globe where other people were waiting for word on what had happened, only to hear that they had won were quick to join.


 


---


 


All over the world people started to come out of their houses and into the streets, forming an impromptu party without anyone realising it, the knowledge that they had won against one of the largest army in the universe, and had managed to make the universe as a whole a better place (twice over even) was reason enough to celebrate.


 


Heads of state and Army leaders were meeting up whenever they could to talk about this, and try to have an outline on what else they could do - together with the enhanced counsel - on a worldwide defence effort. None of them were naive to think that this would be the last of it, after first New York and now these battles; they had put Earth on the Universal map (so to speak) and others would be around to try their own hand in taking over their planet.


 


But, with the effort and the base the enhanced counsel, as well as Black and Stark had accomplished, they knew that finding people willing and able to stand against aliens and what not were not hard to find, and quite numerous once you knew about it.


 


It was also without question that they needed to find a solution for the extra people that had been willing to show up (and hadn't that been a surprise and a half to suddenly find that people already passed had been permitted to come and help them), but then again, when word reached all of them about the title that Harry Black and Tony Stark held - and that it wasn't just a moniker - they were not that surprised to know they made something like this happen.


 


Those acquainted with Harry Potter-Black knew what kind of miracles the younger of the two could pull off. And Tony Stark had already been known as somewhat of a genius who found a way no matter what he needed to do (Afghanistan had been a prime example of that).


 


---


 


Back on the battlefield clean up was starting, although that was made a whole lot easier with all the enhanced present that could either magic debris away, or turn back time sosaid debris wasn't there anymore.


 


Harry and Tony, as well as Lady Death, Wade, Loki and Tom were helping out wherever they could but kept on being interrupted when someone wanted to speak with the power couple for all that they had done to make sure that Thanos was defeated.


 


Most others were too much in awe at knowing that the quirky and sweet Vanessa was really Lady Death, a Primordial Being that went above and beyond their comprehension. But those already in the know had just greeted her, telling her they were glad for her indirect and direct help to deal with this situation.


 


Loki once he was sure that he wasn't needed anymore, made his way to STARK tower after word reached him that Sleipnir, the one child even Thor had no idea where he was, had showed up - able to take the shape of a horse, he had been hiding on Earth, together with Jormungandr, but felt it safe to come out now that the immediate threat of Odin and Thanos were dealt with.


 


 No one had the heart to tell the man that he had to stay when he had already done a lot, and a parent wanting to see his/her children was something they all could agree with.


 


As Loki took a portal to STARK Tower; Teddy, Harley, Peter, and most of their familie (such as Happy, Colin, Narcissa and Andromeda) made their way onto the remnant of the battlefield to assist in clean up. And to make sure that their family and friends were alright.


 


All four of the teen boys had hugged Harry extra tight when they saw their father/uncle, fearing that the hit he had taken from Thanos did more harm then they were led to believe. All of them were only letting go when Harry assured them, backed up by Vanessa and Tony, that he was fine - sore and tired, but fine.


 


""Boys, I am fine, remember that I am not that hard to kill.""


 


Tom, who was still around, grumbled under his breath, ""you can say that again.""


 


Making Harry beam up at the other man, said man just glowered back, even if his eyes - a more red-brown than the red they had been when he was alive - showed his pleasure in their banter. It once again showed Harry just how much Tom had changed just because of his upbringing. Had that not happened, they would have a Tom Riddle that would be a professor or even the headmaster of Hogwarts, enjoying teaching instead of losing himself like he had done before.


 


He was glad that a lot of the Death eaters had chosen to come back too, to help the world or England with defending themselves and changing the reputation they still had even almost 2 decades after the war. Opinions were being changed with seeing them so changed in Death and willing to work with the Light side to protect what was really important.


 


For most of the Magical community it had been quite a shock to get word that Gellert Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore and Tom Riddle were seen joining into the relief effort. Even more so when the oldest of the three wizards came down to Hogwarts once most of the relief effort was done.


 


The current headmistress was very emotional when she was joined by Albus, and later on even by Severus, both former headmasters taking one last tour of the ancient castle they had at one time called home before they would have to go back to the afterlife.


 


Lady Death had let them know that she was keeping the connection going for a little while, to give all of them the chance to say goodbye to those people they hadn't had a chance to do before. Or to walk in the halls of their former home, or can enjoy those things they could only look over in the afterlife. This was the thing they wanted the most, and would be able to do too.


 


---


 


Harry sat down on a bench outside of the newly restored compound, those who had come from all over had given their goodbyes and were making their way back home - it had been awe inspiring to see so many people together, he had seen Wakandans, Latverians, and even aliens from all corners of the universe, working together to deal with Thanos.


 


Feeling someone's arm around his waist, he leaned back into Tony, feeling his husband rest his chin on his shoulder, ""finally it is over.""


 


The genius hummed, ""finally we can have other things to focus on.""


 


Harry laughed, ""you are right at that, I know you have a whole drawer full of projects you put on hold until this is over, projects you can finally start on in the name of MI or SI. We set the starting point, let's see what Earth will do with the people present here, as I hold no illusions we'll need it more in the future.""


 


Tony grinned, ""the president already called me to talk everything over, and I know there are rumours of the UN calling on us too - as soon as the counsel gives them leave to contact us, they're holding them all off so we can get a breather.""


 


Harry hummed, ""I hate politics, but I guess that won't be so bad, if it's for the better of Earth and the universe.""


 


Tony laughed at that, ""we were prepared to be given a figure position once this took off. We already held some sway with the enhanced counsel before they were connected to something as big as the UN, when they get attached, we'll be figureheads for an idea that might just make the Earth a better place -finally.


 


Plus, I see them doing something with the alien allies we had here today, some of them like the people from Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Mar-Vel, might be worth making an official alliance with. I don't know what they think about the ravagers, and the mismatch of Kree and Skrull, among other races, that showed up today, but I'm sure with Queen Frigga at hand, we'll be able to get the first steps towards an universal alliance going.""


 


Looking up, they could see the Queen walking among her people with her sons and grandchildren at her side, greeting those she knew or introducing herself to those she did not. Thanking them in the name of Asgard and Midgard/Terra/Earth for the help they gave them all.


 


Cuddling up to each other, Harry and Tony made time to just enjoy the moment at least until all the chaos would start in meeting with world leaders, the UN and the skeletal fundations of the universal alliance. For now they wanted to just enjoy their victory - and once they were puppy piled by their son and nephews, enjoy family around them. Finally that would be something they had time for, in between all the planning for what had happened here today.


 


Pepper, Happy, the rest of the Weasleys, Narcissa and Lucius were making their way towards them as well. Most likely ready to leave back to the Tower and just get some rest. Hopefully the UK would reach out and let them know everything was alright there too.


 


Tom, and a lot of the Death Eaters, had already said their goodbyes and had gone back to the afterlife. None of them were comfortable with all that was happening, happy with what they had done, but leaving the rest to the living.


 


Harry and Tom did have a private conversation before the former Dark Lord left, clearing the air of anything that had still been bothering either of them. The eldest of them thanked Harry once again for the orphanage in his honor, as well as everything that Harry had done in the UK to make it easier for people to get the help they needed - like Tom hadn't had.


 


---


 


In the UK, people were coming together to give a tribute to the person who had done so much for them all, but hadn't felt safe to stay in the country he was born in. Something the leading body wanted to change, especially after everything he had done once again - this time to save the whole universe from extinction - he shouldn't be shunned for something they didn't understand, no one had to be shunned, or villainized just for something that wasn't understood.


So, I am posting this early as it's my father's birthday tomorrow and I have no idea at what time I'll make it home and if I'll have the energy to upload stuff then. So, suprise!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Harry was kicking his leg up with nerves, after everything was said and done. The dead, buried, and the wounded took care of all of them - those that had fought at least- had been invited to speak with the president and honoured for the things they had done for the good of the world, and America.


 


As they were wrapping up there, president Ellis had extended an invitation to Harry and Tony to attend a meeting with the UN and the skeleton group that was supposed to be the overview of the new enhanced task force together with the enhanced counsel.


 


If these last few days taught them anything it was that there were a whole lot more people able and willing to help than they had first thought. Why not give those people a voice, and a representative - which they had been named by all the people that had been asked (which had been most of the people present on the battlefield).


 


What hadn't been told at first was that most of the heads of state from around the world would be attending. And that the Queen herself had asked that they invite Harry and Tony personally,  instead of letting them call in.


 


They had planned on calling in, seeing as the meeting was to take place in London  which became an issue seeing as Harry had promised to never set foot in his country of birth, both for his own good and to please the people that were pointing fingers at him for being the next Dark Lord and using this changes to make sure people would follow him when the time came.


 


It had taken Tony, Vanessa, Wade, Remus, Lucius and Andy three days to talk to him, and convince him that he needed to go. that it might just be what he needed, with the way he did leave the UK almost 20 years earlier.


 


He had kept his promise, but one did not just wave away a personal invitation of the Queen of England, least of all when you were British yourself.


 


In the end it had taken several calls to England, to show Harry that those which believed him to be a Dark Lord in training, and wanting to convert the populace, had turned around at all the good the changes he had implemented brought. The fact that he was sincere in his promise never to return had even made some of them regret the way they had acted.


 


After all, he was British born and raised, having done so many amazing things for England, and continued to do so even from America. The fact that he had once again put his life on the line to save them all, had made them all agree that the agreements of 20 years earlier would be abolished. It was time their hero was allowed to come home.


 


So, here they were, waiting to be allowed into the UN building that would serve as the meeting spot. As not everything talked about was pertaining to the enhanced community, they were politely asked to wait. They could join the after meeting refreshments and such.


 


Besides the Queen, king T'Chaka of Wakanda and the representative of Latveria asked to talk to them, at their convenience.


 


Part of Tony wanted to laugh, one of the strongest people in the universe  and Harry was nervous to be back in his home country after not stepping foot into it for 20 years. His husband had the oddest quirks, but it was one of the reasons he lives him so much.


 


As his phone chimed, he had to laugh at the pictures they were getting. Pepper and Happy, as well as Remus, Dora and Andy had joined them in England and were watching over Harley, Teddy and Peter. The last one had been allowed to come since Ben and May wanted to enjoy their own little get away. Their nephew didn't mind as he had quite the company to go with to Europe of all things.


 


""Sweetheart, you need to calm down. Nothing will happen, we're here on the request of the Queen, who is also the monarch in the eyes of the Wizarding World, it will be fine, relax.""


 


Harry took a deep breath in as Tony told him this, forcefully breathing it back out and going right back to jiggling his leg. Tony couldn't help but be slightly amused by this, even if he could see how tense Harry was being.


 


Settling his hands in the other man's shoulders he had him loon at him, a soft smile on his face as Harry smiled back without it being forced.


 


""It's ok, stop worrying.""


 


Just as Harry opened his mouth to reply, the door to the conference room opened and one of the security person stepped out, "" they would like to see you now.""


 


As soon as the two of them stepped into the room, they were met with a standing ovation and applause, all of the people - royalty and heads of state alike - were looking at the two of them with awe very present in their eyes.


 


The only reason that Harry didn't look down, was because as one of the biggest businessmen in the world, as well as the husband of Tony Stark and the boy-who-lived had made him grow accustomed to stares wherever he came. Of course it was a bit different now as the people looking at him know where almost all people who were running, or helped run a country.


 


---


 


As they came out of the meeting room, both of them were impressed by the people that knew that by name and wanted to extend an invitation to them to either visit or broaden the reach of SI and/or MI.


 


Romania, or it's president, had taken the time to shake both their hands, thanking them for what they were doing in their country for the poorer neighbourhoods, and how because of that, so many things had changed in a positive way. He was joyous in asking them to come and visit to see just what they had done for his people.


 


The Queen, as she had asked, had the both of them escorted with her as they left for Buckingham palace, several hundred people standing at its gates to catch a glimpse of either them, or the royal family. The people they could see were holding up signs or banners with 'thank you' and 'you rock' messages scrawled across - it was something neither of them had really had happen. 


 


Once in the Palace, the Queen announced that they would be joined by the magical head of state, the current minister, who was well on her way to be re-elected for the fourth time in a row.


 


Knowing what was going to follow, Tony did a step to the side as a pretty woman with dark brown curls made her way to Harry and hugged him tightly to her, this would be the first hug the best of friends shared since Harry left the UK 20 years ago.


 


Grinning, Tony accepted the hand of a lanky redhead that appeared next to him. From all the Weasleys he had met, as well as the fact that Pepper was one as well, this was the only had he had never seen in real life. For all that Ron and Hermione Weasley were Harry's best friends, they had all had to miss each other since Harry left. The couple had big tasks to fulfill in the UK, while Harry had left for a reason and needed a lot of convincing to even consider coming back.


 


They finished their business with the Queen, before she left them to go back to her duties, telling both Harry and Tony to come by again for tea some other time. She was a little short on time today, but knew that her grandsons, and a whole platoon of family members would love to meet them.


 


---


 


Harry wiped at his eyes, ""Hi Mione.""


 


The current minister of magic gave a weak chuckle, the tears running over her cheeks as she smiled at her best friend.


 


""Hi Harry.""


 


Turning she held out a hand out to Tony for him to shake, while Harry and Ron hugged each other close after so long.


 


""Tony, it's so nice to finally meet you face to face, I'm Hermione Granger-Weasley, I am so happy that Harry found you. From what Gin-Pepper has told me you're perfect for one another.""


 


Tony smiled bashfully at this, he was so used to his own friends saying the same things, it felt good to hear that it was also true the other way around. Pepper knew the both of them well enough, that he did believe her, but this was still different.


 


Catching up, Hermione mentioned that there were other people that loved to see Harry, but hadn't wanted to overwhelm him. However, they had asked her to ask him - ask them - if they would want to visit Hogwarts, so they could all meet up, but it would be large enough that Harry wouldn't feel locked up. And didn't that make sense why Harry felt so at home in a mansion or a tower, to know he had done his schooling in an actual castle.


 


His husband had looked kind of uncertain, reminding Tony about how he had been uncertain about coming to the UK as a whole.


 


""I think we should go, love, if anything happens we just leave. And if something else happens, I did pack the starkanium suit in the expectation that we'd be going to the more magical dense places.""


 


Hermione and Ron beamed right at him, as Harry looked at him, his lip worrying in between his lips.


 


""We came here for a reason right, and if I followed correctly then the opinions people had about you have changed drastically. I say we get the others, and the boys, and go and look at the school that you all went to. It had to be something, because I don't know how I could function without you and Pep at my side.""


 


Harry blushed, with Hermione cooing at the two of them in the background. They might be sapy, but he knew that Harry liked that, they adored each other, and weren't afraid to show that. Especially not since they were proud that they were still so in love - and despite the family complaining, they were more than happy about that too.


 


---


 


As they were touring Hogwarts with the kids, Tony couldn't help but look around and try to get over the fact that Harry had willingly left all of this behind to make sure that England had the chance to grow without people assuming he's trying to force something. The fact that Hermions made sure that she had a very diverse cabinet in the office was one of those things that before had not been done. It had all been a game of bribes and helping one's family or allies instead of getting competent people in office. 


 


But it also told him that Harry's character was much like his own, that he was willing to give up his own happiness for that of his loved ones.


 


He still saw his beaming smile when the current headmistress had hugged him close when they arrived at Hogwarts, more than one person had told him that they had feared he would fly back to America sooner rather than later because of everything that had happened before.


 


But that laid behind them, they had saved Earth, and managed to give a lot of people a way to say goodbye to those they never had a chance to do so. People were seeing that enhanced, while different, were nothing to fear. In fact, it had been because of them that the Earth had been saved. It was proving to be an amazing time to see the world changing.


 


Grinning at his husband, Tony couldn't help but feel elated for meeting him, and for finding his happiness between technology, magic and death.

Even though that had been a little hard to admit both to himself and Dr. Raynor. 

After the blip, or reverse blip, whatever they're calling it, and Stark's funeral, it was only him and Sam for a while. 

They'd been kind of lost, kind of wandering around the forgotten wasteland everyone stumbled back into. And that had been perfect in a way, in a very comforting and familiar way. Bucky had gotten just a little too comfortable. 

Sam sprung it on him, early one Autumn morning: He was planning on returning home to be with his family. His sister needed help with the business, and Sam had mentioned feeling guilty about leaving Sarah. And he gets that; being missing for five years had played hard on everyone, but Bucky hadn't precisely lost anything. 

Except for Sam.

He saw Sam off the morning he left. Stood watching as the plane whisked him away, and suddenly everything had felt quieter. Emptier. 

Thing is, it wasn't just comfort in the wild unknown of their post-blip life. Sam wasn't just comfort. Sam was... damn. Bucky found himself stealing glances far too often at the way Sam smiled, his funny little quirks, his weird possessiveness about Redwing. More often than not, he'd find himself close to Sam like a shadow, always guarding and watchful. 

He dreamt of Sam too, dreamt of them together and admitting how he felt out loud. He was falling hard, and he'd done that one too many times; he knew it only ended in tragedy each time. Still, he stayed close, hoping Sam would have the courage to say something if he even felt anything at all because Bucky would never get it past his lips.

But Sam left instead.

 Goddamnit Bucky 



 I sent you a picture of the docks at sunset. It's nice. Kinda romantic shit you'd like. The sky is pink tonight. You'd love it, you should come see it. 


Bucky stares at the screen, flips it shut, and stares up at his celling instead. At least there's a game on t.v tonight. It should get his mind off the nagging feeling that screams ""Sam"" from every fiber of his body. 

""You should go see her,"" Says Yori during lunch at the sushi bar. Bucky looks bewildered from Leah to Yori and feels his face heat up. 

""Who?"" he says, mouth full, definitely not making eye contact with either of them.

Yori motions to his face, crinkles his nose up, ""The one that makes you look stupid like this."" He flutters his eyes.

""Wow."" Bucky pops another Maki in his mouth, ""That's nice."" 

""Go see her."" Yori pours more soy sauce on his already soaked roll and eats it. 

""I agree,"" says Leah with a smile, ""Not that I don't enjoy the faces you make at your phone. But that's some shit you gotta sort out, man."" 

""I'm finding another place to eat,"" he says, pointing at them with his chopsticks. They laugh.

He's wondering if perhaps they're right. Maybe hanging out with Sam again will do him some good. Maybe he's really just lonely and alone.

Later, back at his apartment, he calls Dr. Raynor, runs the idea by her, and expresses just how stupid he thinks it is. Because she loves when he fucking  expresses  stuff. She doesn't love that he ""depreciates and devalues his own thoughts,"" though. 

Ultimately they agree that perhaps going to see Sam is in everyone's best interests. Might get him some closure, but he doesn't share that part. The last thing this woman needs to know is that Bucky is helplessly stupidly and one-sidedly in love with someone. A man at that. 

Maintain friendships, she said. So that's what he's going to do. Friendship. He's going to friendship the hell out of this.

Sam was right. 

The dock at sunset is exactly the kind of thing Bucky likes. It's all pink and grey and peachy hues. The clouds gather thick on the horizon, white balls shining with golden light. 

He stands and watches for a while, lets the last rays of sun bake on his face as it sets in the distance. And then--

""Barnes?"" 

It feels like a shudder within hearing that voice. When he turns, Sam's up to his elbows in grease, wiping it on an old rag. There's a smudge on his cheek just below his eye, and he's kind of sweaty, wearing a loose and dirty white t-shirt and a pair of worn, washed jeans. 

""Hey, Sam,"" Bucky says, losing his voice in the middle of it, swallowing instead as Sam begins to smile. And yeah, he hadn't been prepared for that at fucking all. He'd forgotten just how goddamn devastating it can be. 

""You got my messages?"" Sam asks. He comes closer, motions for Bucky to put his bag down on a bench. 

""There was a lot."" He frowns.

""That's because you're meant to answer them. It's called a conversation."" 

""That's not a conversation."" 

Sam puts one greasy finger in the air, ""The 21st century begs to differ.""

So he's lost none of that infuriating cheek. Bucky is equal parts annoyed and nostalgic. He remembers the days after they just got back, and Sam's smart ass jokes were all that made him laugh. Late at night when they were up for no good reason, he'd let Sam talk him to sleep about some or other wild story from his childhood on these very docks, in this very town. 

He sighs, ""Did you really invite me here to argue? 'Coz I can just--""

""No, no, no, come on, man. I'm fucking around. You hungry? Wanna eat?"" he grins wide, expectantly, waggles his eyebrows, ""We got fish."" 

They do have fish. So many fish, buffets of different kinds of fish, a grill, a salad bar, battered and fried fish, and it all smells divine, yet Bucky can't shake the uneasy longing in his gut. 

He wants to be back in the tiny apartment they shared before Sam left. He wants to go back to Chinese take-out on Fridays and shitty action movies and playing monopoly to the point of fighting. He wants that safe feeling back, that complete contentment he felt when it was just them. 

But Sam's got all this now- his family, his home, friends, a whole life to get into. Sam has no reason to miss the bewilderment and confusion, the uncertainty and loneliness. There's no reason he'd miss Bucky or what they had. Or didn't have. 

""So therapy, huh?"" Sam says, licks some sauce off his fingers, eyes flicking up at Bucky across the table. The lights draped around the wooden logs cast an orange glow all around him, kind of like the sunset. Same as the sunset, he's beautiful too. Far too much. Devastating, like he said.

He breathes in, makes himself stop looking, ""It helps, plus it's obligatory for the pardon."" 

Sam laughs, ""She grilling your ass?"" He pushes the hot sauce over to Bucky. He declines.

""Her and everyone else."" 

""Woah Woah Woah, you got friends?"" 

""Yeah, I got friends, Wilson. Jesus."" 

""Who? Who are your friends then, huh?"" 

""What? Are you jealous?"" He doesn't honestly want to hear the answer to that, ""I met them at the sushi place down the road."" 

""For real, man?"" Sam smiles, Bucky swears it looks a little sad, a little fond, something in between perhaps, but he's never seen this look on Sam before. Sam looks away, folds the corner of the menu, ""That's good, Buck. That's real good.""

It's quiet then, kind of awkward, while Bucky pecks at his salad and Sam dips a few prawns into the hot sauce without actually eating anything. 

""So,"" Sam finally says, clearing his throat,  ""Friends.  Plural?""

Bucky nods, ""Leah, Yori and... well Leah and Yori. Unique's kind of weird.""

""Nice."" Sam shifts in his seat, ""Leah?"" 

""Leah, yeah. Works at the sushi bar. Yori's been trying to set us up; the old man's convinced I need a lady in my life.""

Sam laughs, ""Wait, how old are they?"" He leans forward, grinning so stupidly cute Bucky wants to punch him.

""No--hey, no. Come on, don't laugh. Yori's almost my age, but Leah, she's young."" he rolls his eyes, scrunches his napkin into a ball, and tosses it at Sam, ""Stop that."" He can't help it, though; he starts chuckling too. The more Sam laughs, the more contagious it becomes. 

Then, for a brief second, it's how it was back then, just after the blip, when it was them alone in a shabby apartment, playing board games on the small coffee table. Back when he thought he'd find the courage one day to tell Sam just how he felt. When he thought he had all the time in the world.

Bucky rubs at his jaw with his gloved hand, he hasn't laughed like this in a good long while, and it aches a little, and then as the laughter dwindles, they're just sort of staring at each other. Also, awkwardly familiar. Still feels just as helpless as it always had, ever since he realized. 

But, fearing that Sam might notice, he talks instead, ""What about you? Where's your friends?"" 

Sam's mouth opens, about to answer, but he's cut short. 

""Sam!"" 

There's a guy in a US Airforce uniform and a backpack, making his way over. Young and clean-shaven, sharp jaw, doe eyes with pink glowy cheeks.

Sam gives Bucky a look, ""Speak of the devil."" He gets up, drags an extra chair over to their table. They're pretty familiar too, Bucky thinks, judging by the way Sam's greeting him- a handshake turning into a hug, and a happy smile.

""Buck, this is First Lieutenant Torres,"" Sam says, ""Torres, Bucky.""

""Oh, wow, hey man,"" says the young Lieutenant, holds his hand out to Bucky in greeting. ""Nice to meet you."" His fucking teeth are pearly white, and his skin is clear as goddamn glass, and he's sporting that bruised eye like it's a fashion statement.

Bucky bites down on the urge to growl--Dr. Raynor says that's a terrible thing to do ""what the fuck James""--and shakes his hand, eyes him carefully although that doesn't deter the First Lieutenant over here; his gaze slinks right back to Sam. 

""Oh! I got Redwing something!"" They sit down, and the kid starts digging through his backpack. Pulls out a motherboard and a flash drive of some kind, ""Now  this stuff we can keep up with. It's brand new from the base."" And he's beaming, grinning wider than Bucky thought someone's mouth could go. 

Sam fawns over the tech, smiles up at Torres in awe, ""This is the good shit, man! How'd you even get this?"" 

""Oh, it's nothing. Just had my CO make a few calls."" He sheepishly scratches the back of his neck, ""He knows a few guys, so--""

Sam's eyebrows go up, impressed, and he reaches over to squeeze Torres' shoulder, ""This is amazing, kid. Thanks, really.""

Bucky sits and watches in utter horror as the pink darkens on Torres' cheeks. 

Oh, he realizes. 


 Oh. 


Fuck.

This kid's completely in love with Sam, Bucky thinks with terrible clarity, still watching Sam gush about the tech Torres brought him, and, in turn, watching Torres smile so hard he might start vibrating.  

And fuck. How'd he not think about this? That perhaps Sam had moved on, perhaps he was out there... doing stuff with people. How'd it not occur to him that there's someone out there absolutely perfect for Sam, someone kind and good and without all of Bucky's gross baggage?

It occurs to him now though, and it's sobering at best, crushing at worst.

""Evening, gentleman,"" a woman says from beside Sam. Must he be his sister, she's gorgeous; he sees the resemblance instantly. Though, Sarah seems a little quieter, reserved, wiser than Sam, if he thinks about it. 

""Ah,"" Sam says, reaching up to flip the ends of Sarah's braids. She smacks his hand away, ""Ow--this is my sister, Sarah.""

Torres shoots up, holds his hand out to take hers, and then fucking kisses it. Jesus Christ. 

""Ma'am, the name's Joaquin. It's a pleasure.""

""Oh my,"" she laughs, ""I think the pleasure's definitely mine.""

Before Bucky thinks any better of it, he's up too, knocking Torres aside with his hip. 

""Bucky Barnes,"" he flips her left hand over, checking for a ring, ""Miss Wilson, is it?"" and masters an easy rule 3 smile. ""Thrilling to meet you, truly.""

""Oh my god, yeah. Sarah's fine though--Sam, where've you been keeping these finely jawed men all this time?"" She says, regarding both Bucky and Torres with amusement. 

Torres frowns at Bucky, still smiling, constantly goddamn smiling with his mouth full of perfect white teeth. 

Sam's just eyeing them both suspiciously, ""Uhh,"" he laughs, ""Okay, well, now that we're all acquainted, wanna join me at the house for a cigar?"" 

Sarah waves them off, ""I got stuff to do here, can't sit around smoking all day.""

Torres salutes her, and so does Bucky. Because fuck this guy.

""You got some fans, huh?"" Bucky hears Sam tell his sister as he stalks out of the restaurant.

""I think you do actually,"" Sarah says, amused.

""Huh?"" 

""See you later, superhero man."" 

Bucky practically feels her eye roll from here; he's enjoying this conversation.

""Wait, what does that mean? Sarah!""

""Hey, wait up!"" Torres calls from behind him, jogging to fall in line with Bucky. 

Great. Just great. He has to pretend to be totally fine now. He's gotten pretty great at pretending, actually. He's so good at it now that sometimes he convinces even himself. But the ugly, angry feeling currently bubbling in his chest, that annoying niggling pain of rejection, that's... he's not sure he knows how to conceal that. He's not even sure he wants to.

He keeps walking.

""So, uh, you with the Avengers too?"" Torres asks.

""No,"" Bucky says, hands shoved deep in his coat pockets. He looks straight ahead.

""Oh. How do you know Sam then?""

Bucky's head whips to him, ""How do you?""

Torres chuckles nervously. He is cute; Bucky gives him that, ""He did some work for the airforce, I helped. He's pretty great, huh?""

Bucky hates this. This kid doesn't know Sam. He's got no idea. So what, he's seen him fly a few times, seen him up in the sky when he's free and soaring, and he thinks he knows him? No. He hasn't heard Sam whimpering through a nightmare; he doesn't know Riley, doesn't know the pain Sam carries every time he's up in the sky.

""He's awesome."" Bucky does the thing that Dr. Raynor calls a half-assed smile. He doesn't care. 

They all meet up at the house. Redwing's lying in the middle of an old wooden table on the porch among screws and wires and tools, and they sit down around him. Sam brings out his cigar box and a few beers. He hands them out then props his legs up on the porch rail, and exhales hard. 

Bucky pokes absently at Redwing's body when Torres says, ""Oh, Sam's very protective of Redwing, doesn't like people touching him.""

And Bucky knows.  God, he knows this. He remembers it, remembers Sam hunched over the little A.I late at night, tightening up screws, downloading new software, flicking Bucky's hand away when he tried touching anything. 

He glares at Torres, blinking away slowly and takes a sip of his beer instead. That way he won't say anything he'll regret.

The night drags on like that, Sam and Torres joking, talking about mission intel, laughing about some idiots at work. Torres keeps looking at Sam like he hung the moon and Sam gets all coy about it, Torres makes him smile, makes him laugh. It's just like Bucky and Sam used to be, and it eats away at him slowly.

Deep down, he curses the serum for keeping him from getting absolutely shitfaced right now. He'd leave, but he doesn't want to leave Sam.

But the terrible thought of having to share Sam with this guy, forever being on the outskirts watching, makes him choke up. 

""Uhm,"" he shoots up, chair scraping, ""I'm, uh,"" he forces the tight smile again, and Sam knowing what Bucky's real smile looks like, frowns, ""I'm beat. Can I--"" 

Sam gets up too, ""Yeah man, Sarah's got the cottage keys, she'll--""

""Okay,"" he says and jogs down the steps, feels Sam's eyes on his back all the way to the docks. 

God fucking damn it.

 

I had to split this into 2 chapters so there is another one on the way!Thank you guys for all your comments and kudos 


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Bucky is awake far too early the following morning.

He scoops up the blankets he'd spread out on the floor beside the couch and folds them neatly, places the pillow back on the bed, and gets himself in the shower.

He's in there a while, just standing with his forehead against the cold tile, thinking. It's no surprise that when he closes his eyes, there's only one face that appears. Sam. Always Sam. 

Bucky thinks about him in that oil-stained white t-shirt, the way it clung around his biceps. Bucky lets himself imagine just for a second what it'd feel like if that was all his, if he could touch, how it would feel if Sam wrapped him in a hug with those arms. He imagines, foolishly, Sam coming home to him every day, laying down beside him each night. Sam choosing him. 

And then he remembers Joaquin and his perfect face and the honest to god goodness seeping out of him and instead imagines him in Sam's arms, him in Sam's bed, him at the receiving end of Sam's smile.

He gears up, pulls back, but stops himself from making a vibranium fist-sized dent in Sarah's tile and instead takes a deep breath through his nose. 

Once he's dried off, he gets dressed, pours himself some coffee, and goes to watch the sunrise outside the cottage. A little while later, he decides to walks up to the main house where Sarah told him to meet for breakfast. He's early, so he sits by the old table on the porch and waits.

Redwing's still laid out there and has a spring protruding from his side that looks easy enough to repair. He picks up a screwdriver, twisting the spring back inside, lines it up to the mini rocket slope, and screws it shut. 

Sam, rounding the property on his morning run, decides to jog by at the exact moment that Bucky's holding Redwing up to inspect his belly. 

""Aw hell."" He rolls his eyes, places the bot down, and holds his hands up, ""Sorry.""

Sam all sweaty and downright sinful, climbs the steps up to the porch. Out of breath he says, ""Nah, man. It's cool. What's up?"" He nods to Redwing and sits down next to Bucky.

It's not even that close, they've been closer, but Bucky's breath catches. Sam's wearing shorts, his legs are bare and far more muscular than Bucky remembers, he's in a blue sleeveless top, and his arms are bulging and glistening, and Bucky can't fucking think right. 

""Uh. Had a spring loose. One of the rocket propellers."" 

Sam makes an impressed face, nods, ""Nice. Thanks."" He's quiet as he turns Redwing over and pics him up, ""He got nicked with a bullet here."" There's a burnt scrape on his belly, and to Bucky's surprise, Sam hands him over for Bucky to see. ""Now, when I activate Chase Mode, he toggles left.""

Bucky stares at Sam then at Redwing in his hands, knowing full well this man hates hands other than his own fiddling with his robot bird. Bucky blinks, ""Weight down his right side."" 

Sam smiles, sudden and bright, ""Shit, that could work!"" And Bucky's stuck on Sam's gaze again, the warm glow of it, the long swooping curl of his lashes, those cheekbones, that smile. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, help me, he thinks uselessly. 

He thinks, too, that if he weren't such a coward, and had the guts to come out and say it, now would have been the moment. 

The sun is peeking out over the horizon, everything is simply golden and new, and they're already here, already watching each other for no reason at all except to take in their fill. But, like so many times before, reality sets in. 

It's just that usually, reality had been work or Bucky's heaps of insecurities or his utter lack of guts that ruined the moment. 

This time, on this fine morning, it's the one and only Lieutenant Baby Face.

""Up at the crack of dawn, huh?"" he says, coming up the steps with a huge grin and his hair neatly styled in a fucking side parting, wearing a pair of faded jeans and a thin little t-shirt. God. Fuck. 

""Hey now, you know the Airforce don't play,"" Sam greets him, getting up, and Bucky thinks,  for the love of all that is holy do not leave me here with Bright Eyes. But Sam has no mercy and doesn't read minds either. ""Catching a shower, I'll bring coffee.""

""Copy that, Falcon One!"" Torres says, watching Sam go. And hell, Bucky gets  that.  He knows what it feels like watching, dreaming, stupidly hoping that he notices. Being in such total awe of Sam Wilson and unable to tell him. 

""Hey, you sleep okay?"" Torres asks, and Bucky realizes he must have been staring.

""Fine,"" he mumbles, Redwing still in his hands. Torres notices, and a weird thing happens to his face like he realizes something for the very first time, a dawning clarity. Whatever it is, he doesn't say anything, just sits down with a stupid knowing grin on his face. 

""You got bad circulation?"" 

Bucky places Redwing down, ""What?"" 

Torres points to his gloved hand. His long-sleeve covers the rest. 

""Read this article about it; compression gloves help, apparently. Once I sat in a jet so long I couldn't feel my leg for hours after."" He laughs, ""It's a trip walking like that man! I wear compression leggings now.""

Bucky's mouth makes a smile, just like he practiced with Dr. Raynor. He nods slowly. Torres apparently takes that as an invite to babble on about the crazy missions he and Sam undertake. He's gesturing wildly, imitating how Sam flies, high circles and low swoops, making whooshing noises.

""He yanked the dude right out the helicopter! For real, dude, you should have seen it! That was--""

""--classified,"" Sam says, finally returning with a tray of coffee, ""Don't tell this guy, though. He'll steal all my moves.""

Torres laughs, making Sam laugh too, and when they both look away, Bucky mocks them with a hugely childish grimace. He's beyond caring right now. Dr. Raynor's going to have a goddamn field day if he decides to tell her.  An actual 106-year-old baby, we should call People Magazine,  he can hear her say.

 

Later Sarah joins them, and the restaurant sends over a full English breakfast, enough for an army. Thankfully while they eat, Torres can't flirt and gush, but he does take photos of his food, which is the strangest fucking thing Bucky's ever seen. 

Sam leans into one of his photos at some point, hooks his arm around Torres' neck, and smiles. And suddenly, the otherwise delicious coffee tastes foul in Bucky's mouth. It's exactly what he had imagined earlier--Torres in Sam's arms. 

He looks at his plate, feels the fork start to bend in his grip.

""So!"" Sarah says pointedly beside him, ""Bucky, you work in Brooklyn?""

He blinks over at her, exhaling, managing a genuine smile this time, ""No, living off back pay.""

""Oh, Sam didn't say you were military too. Where'd you serve?"" 

Sam clears his throat, swallows his food, ""This guy's been all over! Aw dammit, would you look at that? My coffee's run out!"" 

Bucky's grateful; he didn't have a single answer prepared for that. And Dr. Raynor wonders why he's disinclined to socializing. 

""Oh, let me get that for you,"" says Torres, fixing up another cup for Sam. Bucky rolls his eyes. Sarah sees, he doesn't care. She seems amused, though. The kid hands it over then comes to collect Sarah's empty cup too. And if he doesn't sit the fuck down right now...

""I'm fine, honey, thanks,"" Sarah says.

And then he's coming over to Bucky, but before he touches the cup, Sam hisses out in pain. 

""Damn, kid. Nobody told you about milk before?"" Sam's waving at his mouth, his scalded tongue sticking out just a bit. 

And that's Bucky's queue. 

""I got it!""

He jumps up, grabs the milk, wedges himself between Torres and Sam, and pours cold milk into Sam's cup.

Sarah smiles for some reason, like maybe she's sick of goody-two-shoes too, and looks at Sam with her eyebrows high. 

Sam stares at her, looks behind him, confused, ""What?"" 

""Oh, you dumb."" She shakes her head but doesn't divulge anything further. 

""What!?"" 

Torres interjects, ""So, uh, I saw on the local page they'll have a fun day out by the river today; how about it?"" 

""Hells yeah,"" Sam says, doing a little excited shimmy making Sarah and Torres laugh. And Bucky would too, but he's preoccupied with the thought of Sam wet and shirtless. 

This can only end in disaster. 

 

The thing is, Bucky had seen Sam without a stitch of clothing before. He'd seen it all when they lived together, and it had been a goddamn sight. But this- Sam, shirtless and glowing in the harsh sunlight, this is something else.

It's a real struggle keeping his eyes to himself. He only just keeps from being caught out several times. 

They're on the riverbank, there's a buzz of people on the other side, some guys have thrown a barbecue and a barrel of drinks together, and there's music pumping from Sarah's restaurant.

Torres is already in the water, soaked and gloriously parading  his youthful body around. Bucky is not fucking jealous. He's not. He was the goddamn Winter Soldier; he's got muscles too, he's got abs and stuff. But this kid's really got it going on.

Bucky hates to think that Sam's watching right now. Doesn't want to turn and see. 

Torres climbs up on the diving board, the highest tier, and waves at them. He cups his hands around his mouth and shouts, ""Hey Bucky! Remember that story about Sam flipping out of the helicopter? Check this out!""

He launches himself off the plank, straightens his body, and then does a rather impressive two-part flip before curling into a tight ball, plummeting, and finally arrowing into the water without a splash. 

""Jesus,"" Bucky mumbles, and Sam huffs out a laugh beside him where they're watching from the riverbank.

""Damn,"" Sam says when Torres comes jogging out of the water dripping wet, ""Now that's in shape.""

Bucky turns to Sam, shrugs, ""You're in shape.""

""I'm old now, I don't look like that no more.""

""Bullshit,"" Bucky says, so fast he's embarrassed, ""I mean. You know. Whatever. You look good."" 

He feels Sam grinning at the side of his face, ""Yo, Torres! Get your phone. Bucky said something nice!"" 

""Aw Jesus. Stop, will you? I am nice."" He turns just a little to see Sam's face. Can't help that he smiles or that his cheeks have gone impossibly hot.

A wet, tanned, incredibly toned Torres then plops down in front of them. He shakes his hair out, pushes it back, and smiles, all big and stupidly pretty. 

And okay, when the fuck did Bucky start thinking that shit? No. 

""Buck, you gotta try the diving board,"" Torres says, eyeing Bucky, who is still fully dressed. ""I got an extra pair of trunks if you--""

""No thanks, I do  not--""  He shifts, tugs his left sleeve down so his wrist doesn't show, ""--need to try the diving board.""

""You don't like swimming? The water's nice, I swear."" 

""Look, kid--""

Sam touches Bucky's arm, ""Buck,"" he says gently, ""He's cool. Everyone's cool here. You can... you know, you can take it off."" 

Torres looks a little confused, eyes flicking between Sam and Bucky. Bucky clenches his jaw, exhales, and looks down at his left hand in the glove. No one but Sam knows. Sam is the only person who has seen Bucky with nothing to hide all the gruesome scars. 

Bucky's determined to keep it that way, but...

""Buck, come on."" 

But then Sam does that. It's a problem he'll have to sort out, but he knows he'll never be able to deny Sam Wilson anything. 

Slowly he pulls the leather glove off. It drops to the ground as he flexes his fingers. They whir quietly, and Torres sucks in a sharp breath.

""Oh my god. You're--""

""Yeah."" 

Sam pokes at Bucky's arm, grinning, ""Pretty neat, right?"" 

""Oh my god,"" Torres says again, blinking as Bucky pulls his Henley off too. ""Of course!  Bucky.  Bucky Barnes, how'd I not figure that out.?""

""Good thing you're pretty,"" Bucky grumbles.

Sam laughs, ""Man, the history books left out how salty he is, huh?"" 

Torres has malfunctioned.

""Oh my  god?"" 

""Okay, lieutenant babyface, let's breathe."" Sam claps a hand down on his shoulder and gets up. 

They all head down to the water this time. They climb all the way to the top and take turns diving off the board. Sam goes first, triple flip, and a cannonball. Torres does another mid-air spin with just a minor splash when he submerges. 

Sam cheers wildly from where he's floating in the water below. When Torres comes up, Sam high-fives him, and pulls him closer by the neck and gives a rough little shake. They float together, looking up at Bucky to jump. 

He smirks, takes a few steps back, and thinks, t ake this, private heart eyes. 

He runs, launches into the air, propels himself around, and does five perfect spins in the air before diving straight down into the waiting water with a splash. 

While under, he hears the clapping and cheering of onlookers around the lake. Feeling warmly satisfied, he pops back up. And yes, that was incredibly worth it. Sam's staring at him, mouth open with an awe-filled grin. 

While they wait for their lunch to cook, they play some football. Bucky hasn't played in a terribly long time, but he remembers watching it, kind of remembers the rules. Not that it matters when he can do the things he can do. 

Sam plays rough, but he lets Torres win. Time and time again. Bucky knows Sam can go harder and knows he can kick both their asses, but he lets the kid slide each time. And as if that's not enough, his hands are all over Torres, dragging along his bare stomach as he lets a tackle slip, around his thighs when he hoists him up to catch and flat against his sides when he lowers him again. 

The soft smiles, all these touches, the two of them in each other's space. Bucky's losing his goddamn mind.

They kick off again, Sam runs with the ball, and Torres jumps in front of Bucky, screams ""pass!"" and holds his hands up for the ball. Sam smiles, brilliantly and beautifully, glistening with sweat, and that's it.

Bucky spins around and stalks off. He can't stand it anymore. Can't be here, can't look at Sam, can keep feeling this helpless and stupid and lonely. He can't.

""Buck?"" Sam calls after him, ""Bucky? Wait up!""

He keeps walking, grabs his shirt, and slips it on, forcing down the frustration and the rush in his pounding heart. 

""Bucky!"" Sam shouts again, caught up with him now, and grabs his elbow to spin him around. ""Man, stop!""

He snaps his arm away from Sam's hold, looks him dead in the eye--those beautiful big brown eyes--fuming inside, throat clogged up and tight.

""What!"" 

Sam reels back, ""What the hell is your problem?""

""I'm so fucking--I'm in love with you! That's my problem!"" 

Everything goes fuzzy and quiet around him; he just sees Sam blink in surprise, the angry frown between his eyes melts away and his jaw snaps shut. It'd be funny if Bucky didn't just monumentally ruin everything.

""Fuck,"" he whispers to himself, drops his head. He squeezes his eyes shut. That's not it. That's not what he wanted to say, not at all how he pictured coming out with it. 

Sam's still looking at him, wordlessly, and Bucky's never wanted to be sucked into one of Dr. Strange's orange time holes so bad in his life.

Behind Sam, Torres is stunned too, ""Wow..."" 

Sam turns to glare at him then looks back at Bucky, ""Buck--""

But Bucky stops him. He knows what's coming. He doesn't need to hear it. 

""Look, I'm sorry."" He takes one last look, commits it to memory, and then he runs.

 

Thank you for reading! Last chapter coming shortly.

Thank you guys so much for all the enthusiasm in the comments, and for your kudos. Hope you enjoy the last chapter! This follows on directly from where chapter 2 left off


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""Aw shit!"" Sam looks at Torres for some kind of answer he guesses, hands on his hips and absolutely at a loss. In the distance, Sam can see Sarah watching from the docks too. Great.

Bucky has disappeared down the road, and he runs way too fast for Sam to simply catch up by sprinting. He wants to, though. He wants to run after him and tackle his dumb ass to the ground, maybe beat some sense into him.

""Sam!"" Torres laughs half incredulously, snapping him out of it, and Sam frowns at him for a moment. ""Jesus,"" he says like he's exhausted, ""Go after him!"" 

""Fuck. You're right!"" Sam starts sprinting toward the porch where he left his wing pack, pulls on a shirt in the same haste Bucky had just seconds ago. He flings the gear onto his back, straps in, and runs toward the pier. The road curves just behind the trees near there; he'll be able to intercept Bucky on the way if he's quick about it. 

Sarah shakes her head when he passes the restaurant, ""Get it, mister superhero man!"" 

Sam lets out an honest to god growl as he runs, ""Arg! Is this why you called me dumb before? You saw this coming, Sarah!""

She cackles out loud and snaps a photo. He can't believe this shit. He helped save the world multiple goddamn times; he doesn't deserve this. 

As he takes flight, a nervous unease starts building up in his chest, a choking sensation that he doesn't care for at fucking all. What if he's too late and Bucky is gone? They both know how easily and quickly he can make himself vanish into thin air. He could be long gone by now, blended into society like a shadow. 

And Sam would never get the chance to tell him... tell him what exactly? That he's been missing him like a goddamn heartbeat ever since he left, that nothing's been the same, and no one makes him laugh quite as hard as Bucky trying to make a card payment online. 

That he had been sending message after message in the hopes of getting a call back instead--he knows that man's fingers are too big for those little keys--and maybe he hoped to hear that Brooklyn accent cuss him out from hundreds of miles away. 

Maybe he'd tell him that he'd gotten used to his ruffled, sleep wrinkled ass being in the kitchen when he wakes up, gotten used to the comfort of falling asleep in his presence, knowing no harm would come to him as long as Bucky was near.

He'd tell him how he can't fall asleep properly anymore, not without hearing the soft whir of his vibranium arm. He'd tell him he misses strolling side by side down the street, going shopping for more black clothes, getting coffee on the way home. Most of all, he'd tell him that he wants it back more than anything.

Probably, he'd tell him that yeah, he hadn't realized it, but he fell in love too.

Finally, to his relief, he spots an angry speck below, stomping down the dirt road that leads to the highway.  

Bucky looks up and sees Sam, throws his hands in the air, ""No! Go away!""

Sam swoops down, cuts off the angry walking, and lands right in front of him.

""Nah, we gonna talk.""

""I don't wanna talk about it."" 

He starts walking again. Sam falls into step with him and retracts the wings.

""So, what, you're just gonna walk back to Brooklyn?""

""Yes."" He glares at Sam then looks ahead again.

""And then?"" 

""And then I'll go to therapy for twenty-four hours straight."" 

Sam laughs. He fiddles around in the wing pack's strap and pulls out an old burner phone, holds it to his ear. 

""Yeah? Okay. What's your doctor's name?"" 

Amused but still kind of offish, he looks at Sam, eyebrow up. ""Dr. Raynor--What are you doing?"" 

Sam bites back a smile, knowing they're both complete idiots, huge fucking fools. But this is what they do, what they've always done. This is who they are.

""Hello? Dr. Raynor?"" He says, obviously faking hard, ""Cool. Yeah, I'll let him know.""

Bucky shakes his head, eyes up at the heavens.

""She said you gotta talk to me.""

""She said that, huh?"" he starts smiling, but it drops off quickly, ""You don't want me to start talking, believe me."" 

Sam stops walking and grabs Bucky's wrist carefully. ""Hey. For real man."" 

It seems to pain him physically to do it, but he stops, looks at Sam so completely, devastatingly sad, and sighs. 

""Look, I shouldn't have said that stuff. That wasn't... I didn't want it--""

""That stuff?"" Sam laughs, ""That stuff, as in the stuff where you love me? That  stuff?"" 

""God. Yeah."" he makes a face, ""Yeah, that stuff. I was just... with Torres, and you, I was just--""

""Jealous? Wait, wait, wait. Oh my god!"" And now Sam's really goddamn laughing, his belly aches, ""You serious?"" 

""Apparently not. Anyway, goodbye, Sam."" He starts down the road again, faster now, and okay, maybe Sam shouldn't have laughed. This dude's just beginning to figure out his emotions, and Sam knows Dr. Raynor is probably at the 'expressing things' stage of counseling, but the idea that they've managed to miss the mark so epically is beyond him. Gotta fix it real quick, superhero man, he hears Sarah say.

""You didn't even let me reply, man!"" he shouts at Bucky's back. 

Bucky keeps walking. Over his shoulder, he gives an incredulous snort, ""Reply with what, huh? What a big asshole I am? Nah--"" 

""That..."" he pauses, inhales, ""Me too."" 

That makes Bucky stop at least; his back is still to Sam, but his head tilts up to the sky. ""What?"" 

""Look, Buck, with all that's been going on, with the shield and the world being what it is, I didn't think--can you look at me? Please?""

Bucky slowly turns then, shoves his hands in his pockets, hunches forward in the way he always does when the world gets too big around him. And there's that deep grove between his eyes again. Sam wants to ease it out with his thumb but doesn't.

""Never felt like the right time to say anything, you know,"" Sam tells him, ""And that's on both of us."" 

Bucky's chin cants up a little, his lips twisting up, ""Well, we said it now, didn't we?""

Sam goes closer to where Bucky is standing, close enough to curl his pinky around Bucky's vibranium one. The contact feels good, sweet, like relief. 

""Yeah, we did,"" He says, smiles up at Bucky, and watches the frown melt away, his eyes carefully flicking over Sam's face. Sam knows that look. He felt this exact same way when Bucky showed up at the docks yesterday. That's the content look of a man reunited with what he had been missing. 

Bucky exhales, shakes his head, and pulls Sam closer to wrap him up in a long-overdue hug. That feels even better. Sam breathes out into his neck and holds on tight, arms around his back. 

They stay that way for a while under the baking sun, just standing close with no real rush to move, until Bucky softly, tentatively, presses his lips against Sam's temple and pulls away. 

""They're uh, probably wondering,"" Sam says, cheeks a little warm now as he motions back to the docks. 

Bucky lets out a rough laugh, nervously scratches his beard, ""I, uh, don't think they're wondering about anything."" He points to something behind Sam.

Redwing bleeps hysterically like he's malfunctioning when Sam turns around, swiveling from side to side, not really knowing where to flee to after being caught.

""Torres!"" Sam shouts at his drone, ""I'm about to kick your ass!""

Later, everyone's at the restaurant, and Sarah has some up-beat jazz playing through the speakers. A few folks are dancing inside, and Sam had just taken Mrs. Jones for a spin when he notices Bucky's nowhere to be found. 

He spots him at the edge of the docks, beer in hand, peering out at the setting sun and rippling water. He hands Mrs. Jones over to Torres, who happily takes her hand and then does some acrobatic shit that probably ain't that great for her hips. 

""You feeling jealous again?"" he says, coming to stand beside Bucky, ""Relax, she ain't really my type.""

Bucky snorts, bumps his shoulder into Sam's, ""I'm not jealous. Just, uh, tell that kid to keep his shirt on, okay?"" 

When Sam laughs embarrassingly loud, Bucky smiles too, watches him. Their eyes meet again when Sam has composed himself; he feels a fondness grow in his chest that makes his tummy feel fluttery and makes his heart pound right in his throat. 

""I have a list,"" Bucky tells him, then takes a deep calm breath. 

Sam leans his forearms on the wooden railing. They both look out at the water. ""What kind of list?"" He knows what kind of list. 

""Names. Amends I need to make.""

""Atonement,"" Sam says. 

""I'm not putting Torres on the list,"" he says quickly, ""But I will apologize, I guess, for being an asshole or whatever."" 

""I don't think he's too mad,"" Sam says smiling, ""He knows  two  superheroes now. Dude's kind of a fan."" 

Bucky pulls a face again, ""Yeah, it's unsettling."" 

""It's cute."" 

Sam laughs when Bucky narrows his eyes and looks like he's about to square up, ""I'm still sensitive, Sam."" he mumbles. 

And god, this is exactly what Sam had been missing. This easy bullshitting, the way everything is ten times funnier when Bucky says it, the way he always makes Sam laugh even when he's doing nothing at all. 

Sam straightens up again, ""Okay,"" he says quietly, shifting into Bucky's space, so they're standing close together now. ""I'm sorry.""

Bucky's breath pulls in sharp as he looks down at Sam, and carefully brings his right hand up to Sam's face. He traces over Sam's cheek and curls his fingers around the back of his neck. 

""It's okay,"" he says absently, quietly, eyes on Sam's, and then he leans down and finally kisses him. 

It's not like anything Sam ever imagined, kissing Bucky Barnes; it's definitely better. Bucky's careful and slow about it. His hands, even the vibranium, are warm on Sam's skin, and Sam leans into it eagerly.

Bucky's lips are red and bothered when he pulls away and blinks down at Sam, ""That's,"" he starts laughing, cheeks flushing.

Sam can't help but laugh, too; it's no secret that they're absolute idiots.

""Yeah,"" he says. His fingers brush over the wetness on his lips where Bucky's had been a second ago. 

And then they're just kind of staring at each other with delirious happiness on their faces, grinning so hard Sam thinks their faces will crack at any moment now. Sam doesn't give a single shit. He's just watching the way Bucky's biting his lip, basking under his steady gaze.

They'd stay there all night; they really would, but--

""Whoop whoop! Heart eyes for the win!"" Torres yells from the restaurant.

""I'm really gonna have to kick his ass, huh?"" 

""In a minute,"" Bucky says, paying Torres no mind, then kisses Sam again.

Happily, Sam thinks he'd be an idiot with this guy any day.

ONE 

 

""This isn't the way to your apartment,"" Sam says, five minutes after Bucky takes a right when he should've taken a left.

""Excellent observation, Sam,"" says Bucky. He doesn't slow or turn around, just keeps pushing ahead, dusty black boots a steady  thump-thump-thump over the ground. ""You do your former namesake proud.""

""You think you're real funny, don't you, Buck. Where're we going?""

""To a place,"" says Bucky, because he's a smartass.

""A place,"" Sam echoes, unamused. ""Mind elaborating a little more?""

""Hmmm. No."" 

Sam narrows his eyes at Bucky's back. ""Alright, don't tell me,"" he grumbles. ""See if I care.""

The scent of recently-fallen rain is fresh on the night air, mingling with the less desirable city-smells of car exhaust and manhole steam. Sam catches a whiff of garbage from an alley, curses under his breath, and widens his stride--not everyone can power walk as fast as a super soldier. Sam's not embarrassed of that. 

He ends up so preoccupied with watching how Bucky's dark shadow cuts through the smeary-wet glow of city lights on pavement that when his friend stops in the middle of the sidewalk, Sam plows straight into him. 

""Whoa,"" Bucky says, smirk spreading over his face, even as he catches Sam gently by the elbow before he bounces off his back and onto the sidewalk. ""Falling asleep on your feet, flappy bird? You gonna need someone to tuck you into bed now? Rest those weary bones of yours?""

""Shut up. You're the weary one, old man,"" Sam says, and then casts a considering eye over the restaurant they've stopped in front of. He whistles. ""Sushi? Pretty fancy for our usual post-mission, Buck.""

Bucky shrugs. ""It's my turn to buy, so. My choice.""

This has become somewhat of a tradition, ever since Sam and Bucky fell into their little not-partnership during the Flag Smashers situation and never managed to fall back out. In the wake of that final, devastating battle, Bucky had waited for Sam to return from fishing the final Flag Smasher out of the water, and then followed Sam in silence all the way back to Sam's apartment--only, he claimed in nonchalance, to make sure Sam's 'delicate human body' didn't pass out after such incredible exertion, and then he'd be 'right on his way'. 

What actually happened was that Bucky had planted his ass on Sam's little couch, heard Sam's stomach growling, declared loudly that he was entering step one of plan 'go to them and be of service,' Sam edition, and then ordered them both Chinese takeout and stared mournfully until Sam relented and started wolfing down his box of reparations stir-fry. 

And then he'd joined Sam on every one of his missions since, and somewhere along the line, a habit formed; in between having each other's backs and taking down bad guys, they'd head over to one of their places, patch themselves up, and then order food and eat, taking in their creeping fatigue and bruised bodies and the fact that they were still alive, together. 

Sam had gotten them Thai curry after their last mission, so Bucky is right in saying that it's his turn to choose. He's just surprised Bucky was a sushi type of guy.

He says as much, and Bucky snorts. 

""What the hell's that supposed to mean? And anyway, I wasn't the one griping about how he wanted sashimi yesterday,"" Bucky says, looking away. ""I just don't wanna have to sit through more of your complaining.""

Sam suddenly recalls a vague memory of chattering about hand rolls while looping through the sky and dodging bullets, and fondness swells warm and high in his chest. He didn't realize that Bucky had actually been listening. 

""Aw, Buck,"" he cheers, smacking at a leather-covered arm. ""You really do care!""

Bucky yanks the door open, faux-annoyed, but under the orange-lantern glow leaking through the glass storefront, Sam can see the side of his mouth tick up in the corner, just for a second.  

""Shut up,"" he grouses, ""and get your ass inside.""

It's late enough in the evening that most of the little restaurant is cleared out; there are only a few occupied tables in the corners, each group of patrons chattering quietly to themselves over their tea. At the bright jingle of the bell on the door, a pretty young woman pops her head out from the back. ""Welcome to Izzy's! I'll be with you in just a sec--oh! It's you.""

For a moment, Sam stops in his tracks, confused. Then, he follows the woman's eyeline to Bucky, who's frozen just over Sam's shoulder and making a very interesting face. 

""Hi, Leah,"" Bucky greets, voice weak. ""Didn't think I'd see you tonight.""

'Leah' raises an eyebrow and scoots her way out from between the curtains at the kitchen's entrance. ""I work here every weekday.""

""Oh,"" says Bucky, shifting from foot to foot, fidgeting like he's on the verge of sprinting off into the night. ""That's right.""

""Mhm. Were you hoping I got fired or something?""

""No, I--""

""I'm just messing with ya,"" Leah says, a dimpled smile finally breaking across her face. ""Just surprised to see you here with someone other than Yori! Surprised you're coming back at all, considering last time. Grab a seat, it's been a while!"" 

Somehow, this makes Bucky wince even further, and Sam--sharp as a shark in bloody water and a most avid collector of Bucky's embarrassing moments--jumps on it eagerly.

""Hi, Leah,"" he says, approaching the bar and extending one hand in greeting. ""I'm Sam. I'm sorry you had the misfortune of knowing this ol' grump.""

""Leah,"" she says, dipping her head. ""I know who you are, Captain America. I'd shake your hand, but I've got rice vinegar all over my fingers."" 

""Ooh, yeah, I'll pass on that. But it's nice to meet you. Good to know Buck still gets to know people outside of work, you know, I was starting to get worried for him!""

Bucky slides up next to him at the bar, shoulder-to-shoulder; Sam doesn't look, but he can feel Bucky's glare drilling into the side of the face. He knocks their arms together. 

""C'mon, loosen up. Your friends are my friends, right? I just wanna know what you're like around other people!""

""Don't act clever, Sam. You might strain something,"" Bucky says with a  scowl, but he still goes to the trouble of pulling Sam's chair out for him. 

(Sam will admit, he'd been a bit thrown by Bucky's behavior in the beginning, what with all the pulling of chairs, opening of doors, and carrying of heavy things. He'd asked Bucky about it, once, just a couple of days after he'd noticed it, and Bucky had deflected with a shrug.

 Dunno, Sam,  he'd said, a weird, shifty look sliding over his face.  I just wanna--I'm used to doing that, I guess. Don't see why I have to stop.  

Sam had written it down to a holdover from typical 1940's chivalrous-gentleman etiquette and gotten used to it. Whatever makes the guy feel better, he supposes.)

When Sam slides down into his seat without a word, Leah takes a long moment to simply look between her two new customers, eyes dark and thoughtful. 

""Hang tight,"" she says finally, wiping her hands off on her apron. ""Let me go grab menus for you both.""

Five minutes later finds Sam and Bucky with their heads tucked over the laminated restaurant menus, bickering about what to get. The counter is slightly damp-sticky under their arms, in the way that means it was wiped down not long ago; Sam drums his fingers across the dark wood as he makes his case for ordering one more dish than usual.

""Should I get the yellowtail--""

""Jeez, Sam, that's the most expensive thing on the menu!""

""But it's  delicious, c'mon, you know I can't say no to that.""

""What happened to 'I would sell my liver just for some cheap crab right now,' huh? Are you just doing this 'cause I'm the one paying?""

""Yeah, why else? Gotta put that military backpay somewhere."" Sam smiles widely, relishing the way Bucky's face flushes slightly in agitation. Ooh, Sam's got him now--that pasty-ass skin can't hide anything. ""What, all those riches collected at your advanced age, and you're gonna be a scrooge? Huh, old man?""

Bucky leans in. ""Oh, that's how it is. You only want me for my money.""

""Don't flatter yourself, Buckaroo. The only wanting happening here is between me and that sweet, sweet yellowtail. C'mon, don't be boring, you're gonna have thousands of dollars in the bank just to eat some lame-ass California rolls?""

Bucky brandishes his own menu at Sam like a weapon, the laminated paper making an unpleasant wibbling noise as it flops about in the air. ""You,"" he declares, ""are a pain in my ass. Fine, get whatever you want. See if you can finish it later.""

""I know you're gonna steal my leftovers anyway. You and the black hole in your stomach.""

Leah, taking her cue, slides up to them from where she'd been polishing glasses at the other end of the bar. She's got a good customer service face, but judging by the way her lips are twitching up at the corners in thinly-veiled amusement, Sam's guessing she had been listening in; not that it really was hard to hear them, either. They're by far the loudest patrons in the restaurant.

""So,"" Sam says as Leah scribbles down their orders. ""I don't mean to pry, but I was just curious--how did you and Bucky here get to know each other? 

There's a beat of silence. Leah fiddles with her notebook, and when she looks back up, her expression seems almost apologetic.

""We actually went on a date,"" she admits, and when Sam splutter-laughs through his surprise, she adds on hastily, ""But it wasn't anything more! I'm not that invested, I don't really wanna chase after guys who walk out on me during board games, anyway, no offense, Bucky.""

Sam cackles even louder. 

Bucky shrinks a little in his seat. ""I'm really sor--""

""Hey, it's fine. I think I get why you weren't really into it, anyway,"" she says. Her gaze flicks over to Sam as she says that, weirdly enough. 

He twists around a little to see what she's looking at. Nothing out of place, he thinks; the other customers in the dimly-lit restaurant are keeping to themselves, heads down as they eat their sushi. Bucky's not making weird faces, either, is just settled into his seat with his arm slung up on the back of Sam's chair, purposely hogging up space like he always does to try and get on Sam's nerves. 

When he looks back forward, Leah is in the middle of delivering a very meaningful glance towards the side of Bucky's face. ""Anyway,"" she says quickly, turning to catch Sam's eye, ""I'm gonna get your orders to the kitchen, Don't wanna keep you gentlemen waiting too long on empty stomachs.""

With that, she breezes back into the kitchen.

""Oh my god,"" Sam says under his breath, amazed. He knocks his foot into Bucky's legs under the counter, even though he knows that it won't do anything to his shins of steel. ""Bucky! What happened to your whole manners thing!""

""What manners thing?"" Bucky asks. 

""You know, that old-fashioned chivalrous stuff you always do for everyone!""

Bucky gives him one of his typical x-ray stares. 

""What?""

""Not everyone,"" is all that Bucky says, and then he turns his face away and frowns at the wall until Leah comes back with two steaming cups of tea.

 

***

 

By the end of the meal, Sam feels like his body has become more sushi than man. 

After Bucky sneaks the last pieces of sashimi from Sam's plate--""I told you you couldn't finish it!"" he adds, mouth full--he starts taking care of the check, giving Sam the time to slip off to the bathroom. 

On his way back out, he catches the low rumble of conversation from the main dining room and stops to listen. 

""I really am sorry,"" Bucky's voice drifts out to where Sam is standing behind the bend in the hallway. ""I shouldn't have ditched you like that. Back then.""

""Could've used a text, at least,"" Leah sounds like she's smiling. ""Hey, I get it. I was being pretty pushy with my questions, too. I know I probably touched a nerve before you walked out, so I'm sorry too, if I overstepped somehow. No hard feelings?""

""I--yeah. Thanks, Leah.""

""It's all cool. Congratulations, anyway. You seem pretty happy, I'm glad you got that sorted out for you. Be honest, was I the appetizer to distract you from that main course? I gotta applaud you, your taste is spectacular.""

""Uh,"" Bucky says, sounding thrown. ""Well, I haven't really--""

Sam takes this as his cue to step in. Even though he definitely wants to keep listening, he figures that Bucky's suffered enough ribbing tonight, and he can tell that Leah's tone is teasing, even if he has absolutely no idea what they're talking about. 

Bucky holds the door for Sam on the way out, and when it swings closed, Sam catches the ringing of Leah's laughter from the back of the restaurant, faint and amused. 

 

TWO

 

Sam knows Bucky's habits well enough to take his long, brooding silences in stride.

So, when Bucky settles down on the bench across from him and commences their usual post-mission staring contest without a single word, Sam complies gladly. 

It's a welcome distraction, anyway; his shoulders are feeling particularly sore, and he's not looking forward to the hour-long flight between him and the hot shower waiting for him at home. The mission hadn't been particularly hard, but Sam's had a long week. He just wants to be not covered in dust and sweat and bruises for longer than one day at a time, and he can see in Bucky's eyes that he's thinking the same thing. 

But that's a pipe dream for now, so. Distractions it is. 

The metal rings that secure the safety netting rattle noisily as the plane banks to the left; Sam leans forward, planting his elbows on his knees as he fights to keep his eyes wide open.

Bucky stares back, foot tapping.

Sam's eyes are beginning to water a little.

Bucky remains unbothered. Damn super soldier eyes, what the hell kind of enhancement is that? Super eyes?

Sam starts to squint--

""Hey, guys!"" Torres says cheerfully, dropping down from the ladder that leads up to the cockpit with a loud, echoing clank. ""Everything's set up there, so I figured I'd hang back with you two for a bit. Sam, that seat next to you free?"" 

When Sam shoots him a thumbs-up without looking, eyes screaming with discomfort from the strain of keeping them open for so long, Torres slides happily onto the bench next to Sam, boots knocking against Sam's own as he does. 

Across the cargo hold, Bucky's eye twitches. 

""Hah!"" Sam whoops, probably enthusiastically than necessary; his voice reverberates in the metal chamber of the plane's belly, and his celebratory in-place bounce sends him into a near-collision with Torres' shoulder. ""That was a blink! This round goes to me, Buckaroo! Hey, Torres.""

""Hey, Sam,"" Torres says, eyes shining enthusiastically. ""Great job today!""

""Aw, thanks--""

""He always does a great job.""

""Uh,"" Sam says, blinking at where Bucky's straightened from his slump against the wall of the plane, chin lifted. ""Okay? Thanks, Buck. Wow, praise from the cyborg himself? Gotta say I wasn't expecting that.""

Bucky looks away, arms coming up to cross in front of his chest. ""What?"" he says, sounding defensive. ""It's not weird. What are you staring at?""

""I didn't say it was weird, man.""

""You're implying it.""

""Yeah, maybe I am. S'not my fault you're a man of few words.""

""And that's my  fault?""

""I'm just saying, you don't give compliments very often! So I was surprised!""

""Well, you shouldn't be! I was just telling the truth!""

""Well, okay! Thank you for that!""

""You're welcome!""

There's a prolonged beat of silence, during which they stare each other down from their respective seats, and Torres drums his hands on his thighs awkwardly, eyes darting between them like he's trying to decide if he should say something. Then, as Sam eases himself back into his seat, his shoulder twinges sharply. Something must show on his face, because Bucky's expression slides from defiant annoyance to concern in a split second. 

""What was that?""

""Nothing,"" Sam says quickly, rolling his shoulder back. ""Probably just tired.""

""Didn't look like nothing.""

""It's f--""

""C'mon, don't be stubborn. Unless you wanna wait until  we  get back?"" He looks at Torres when he says that, putting a strange emphasis on the words 'we.'

Sam furrows his brow. Yeah, the rattling of the cargo is a bit loud, but here's no reason to shout. ""Why are you hollering like that?"" he asks. ""We're literally sitting right across from you.""

Bucky sighs. ""Just get over here,"" he says, flexing his hands.

Sam goes. That's one of the perks about being friends with Bucky Barnes, he supposes: the vibranium arm is awfully good for giving massages. 

""Closer,"" Bucky says when Sam folds himself down on the bench next to him, back facing Bucky. Sam scoots over a few inches, obliging. ""That's good. Where's it hurt?""

""Left shoulder,"" Sam grunts.

""Okay,"" Bucky says, and then gets to work.

Torres seems pretty content to sit across from their impromptu massage session for a while, but he must be getting bored; at the three minute mark, he breaks the silence by drumming his hands on his thighs.

""Bucky was right earlier,"" he says casually, ignoring the look that Bucky shoots at him for using his first name. ""Sam, you have a really impressive track record. Actually, you had a lot of fans at my old high school, did you know that?""

""Yeah?"" Sam tips his head, excited, even as the rest of his body continues to melt back into Bucky's skilled hands--

(He catches himself doing that very often, now. Leaning into Bucky's touch. He tries not to think about why.)

--because, even in the middle of a post-mission-exhaustion massage, it's always a treat to hear about his own supporters. It's something he's never gotten used to, even years after joining the Avengers. ""That so?""

""Yup! The Avengers were always on tv, so it was a thing for a while. Iron Man fans versus Cap fans, all that jazz. I was kinda in on the trend, too,"" Torres admits, looking a little shy. 

""Let me guess,"" Bucky says sarcastically. ""You were the head of the Falcon fan club. Cap fan club, now, I guess.""

""You're right!"" Torres' face lights up. ""How did you know?""

Bucky's hand spasms on Sam's shoulder. 

""Wow,"" he mutters under his breath. ""Who would have ever known.""

Sam reaches back to slap at him. ""Hey,"" he jokes, ""are you doubting my fanbase?"" To Torres, he says, ""I always knew you had good taste!""

""Yeah,"" replies Torres, ""I actually had a massive crush on you when I was seventeen!"" And then, as soon as the words leave his mouth, his eyes go as wide as dinner plates; the expression on his face suggests that he's considering hurling himself out of the moving plane, sans parachute. 

Sam's sudden snort of laughter is strong enough to send him off balance and reeling backwards into Bucky, who has gone oddly still behind him. ""You're pulling my leg!""

""I didn't mean to say that out loud,"" Torres says weakly. 

""You're for real?  Did baby Torres have posters of me all over his room?""

""There were only two...""

""Oh my god,"" Sam wheezes. He tips back and almost brains himself on Bucky's abnormally solid pecs. ""Only two! Torres, I'm not laughing at you, I just--wow, I'm flattered! Real flattered! You're only human, and I'm a fine specimen, I know--the Wilson family beauty is running strong in these veins, makes me hard to resist. Right, Buck?""

For some reason, Torres goes pale at that, eyes darting first over Sam's shoulder and then down at where Bucky is practically holding Sam's laughter-limp body up. ""Wait, I just realized how it might sound, but I swear I'm not gonna try and make a move on you--I mean, I'm seeing someone right now, too--""

 Too?  thinks Sam

""--and it was ages ago! I was still in school! I mean, not that I don't still think you're a very beautiful man--""

""Torres,"" says Bucky, breaking his silence for the first time since Torres' admission. He sounds constipated. ""I think we get the point.""

""Yeah. Yeah, got it."" Torres mimes zipping his lips and folds his hands in his lap, looking sheepish. ""Sorry, Sam. Sorry, Bucky.""

Sam has three seconds to wonder about why the kid's also apologizing to Bucky before the vibranium hand digs back in, effectively melting away both the muscle knot in his shoulder and any conscious thought left in his brain. He groans loudly. 

""Hnn, that was the spot. Thanks, Buck. You're the best.""

""Yeah,"" says Bucky, sounding smug. His grip tightens, metal fingers pressing cold and insistent against Sam's back. ""I am.""

 

THREE

 

""I said that I'd let you know when to come over,"" Sam sighs in exasperation, ""not that you could break into my apartment while I was gone.""

Bucky raises an eyebrow from where he's made himself at home on Sam's goddamn couch and is drinking Sam's goddamn orange juice. ""You didn't say that I couldn't, either. By the way, you really need better security. It took me literally ten seconds to pick your lock.""

When Sam glares at him, he adds, ""You should get inside. You're letting in all the bugs.""

""Sorry that my regular-person apartment isn't built to keep out super spies such as yourself,"" Sam grumbles, but he does as asked, sliding into the crowded foyer and kicking--uncouth, he knows, but his hands are full of groceries!--the door shut behind him. He aims another kick at the heavy combat boots lying around in the middle of the walkway, sending them tumbling sole over lace into the wall next to his perfectly lined-up sneakers. ""Seriously, Buck? I keep telling you to put your shoes in the shoe rack.""

""Oops,"" says Bucky, not sounding particularly sorry. He steps forward into Sam's space, slides the grocery bags out of his grip without a word, and trots off to the kitchen to start unloading them into the fridge and pantry. ""I'll say it again, since you didn't seem to hear me again the first ten times--Captain America should not be living in an apartment with regular-person security. What if someone tries to break in?""

""What,"" Sam shoots back, ""Like you did?"" 

Bucky scowls. ""You know what I mean.""

""Do I really need security when the esteemed White Wolf--""

""--god, I never should have told you that--""

""When his magnificence  the White Wolf,"" Sam continues loudly, ""is basically over at my apartment every day, mooching off my hospitality, and providing live-in guard services on top of free-of-charge security evaluations?""

""I'm not here that often,"" Bucky protests, and then proceeds to prove himself wrong by knowing exactly where Sam stores every single grocery item in the house. He doesn't even pause between bags, hands moving quickly as he tucks everything away; soy milk on the left side of the second shelf in the refrigerator, brown sugar on the top cabinet next to the stove, organic green tea bags in the drawer below that. 

""Right,"" says Sam, watching as Bucky gathers up the emptied paper bags and stores them beside the plastic bag of plastic bags under the sink. ""Totally unfamiliar territory, this is.""

""Shut up.""

There's only one thing left on the kitchen counter, dug out from where it had been buried deep beneath bunches of carrots and celery. When Bucky swipes up the red-and-white striped bag and holds it out expectantly, Sam scoffs at him. 

""Pop it yourself, Barnes.""

""You're the one who bought it.""

""So you can break into my home for movie night, but you can't make one bag of microwave popcorn?"" He turns around without another word, already shifting through his mental list of  Movies/Shows Bucky Has Not Watched Yet But Definitely Should. They've made it through a pretty good chunk of the list in the past couple months; if Sam remembers correctly, they're about halfway through Black Mirror. 

Three steps into the living room, he freezes in place and and swivels back quickly. ""And remember not to--""

Bucky waves his hand at him, already poking at the microwave touchscreen. ""Don't use the popcorn setting, yeah, yeah. You don't have to keep reminding me.""

Sam's half-perched on the arm of his sofa and scrolling through Netflix to try and find the My List section when his ringtone starts blaring through the half-light of the living room. He looks down at where his phone is face-up on the coffee table; Sharon's name is flashing on the screen.

He picks up immediately.

""Wilson speaking.""

""Heya, Cap."" Sharon's voice is thin and tinny through the speaker. ""Don't sound too stressed, nothing too alarming. I wanted you to know that we just got some new reports coming in from--""

The microwave goes off in the kitchen. Bucky's voice follows, strong and clear over the high-pitched beeping: ""Sam! Popcorn's ready! You want me to add salt on this or not?""

""Oh,"" says Sharon after a long pause. ""Sam, if this isn't a good time...""

""The Winter Asshole's over for movie night,"" Sam replies flippantly. ""It's okay, I can still talk right now. We can be over in ten if you need--""

""Oh,  "" says Sharon, now in a completely different tone. Sam immediately feels on edge; her voice has slipped into that sly register that almost always means she's holding back a smile, usually at his expense. ""In that case! This isn't urgent at all. Don't let me interrupt your night, I'm sure you'll be getting busy later.""

""Huh?"" Sam fumbles with his phone, fingers loose with confusion. ""Sharon, what--""

""Don't sweat it, Cap! I'll just call back tomorrow. Enjoy yourself!""

 Click. The line goes dead.

Sam stares at the black screen, looking for answers. The only thing sees is his own scrunched-up, baffled face being reflected back at him.


 What the hell was that? Getting busy? 


""Sam,"" Bucky says, poking his head in from the kitchen. ""I said your name like three times, did you hear me--""

When he sees the look on Sam's face, he frowns, getting the little crinkled line in the brow that he always gets when he's concerned. His eyes automatically scan the room, looking for threats. ""What's wrong?""

""Nothing."" Sam shakes himself and slides back onto his feet. Slaps his phone back down on the coffee table. ""Just Sharon being weirdly cryptic again.""

Bucky relaxes. ""Ah. Just like usual. Okay, as I was saying. Whaddya want on this popcorn, salt or butter?""

""Both,"" says Sam, because he knows Bucky likes it that way. He pauses, purses his mouth in consideration. ""Or we could just do no seasoning, you know. Just to suit your old man tastes.""

The look on Bucky's face sends him into a fit of laughter.

 

***

 

Twenty minutes into the episode, Sam starts feeling a little thirsty. 

""Gonna get water,"" he says, heaving himself up from the couch. The air conditioning is on at full-blast to combat the mugginess seeping in from the outside, and the cold breeze from the vents is a shock against his skin; he shivers just a bit, and feels goosebumps rise on his bare arms. ""You want anything to drink?""

Bucky doesn't even turn his head, eyes glued directly to the screen. ""Water for me, too,"" he says absently. ""Thanks, sweetheart.""

Sam does his best not to trip over his own feet on the way to the kitchen.

The pet names are a fairly recent development. 

(Sam's not sure when this whole thing started, but he thinks that it might have been kicked off with the conversation they'd had after leaving the restaurant after that evening at Izzy's.

Sam had said something like, Bucky, was romance back then really so lacking that you couldn't even sit through a date with a nice young lady, and then Bucky had said something like, I had incredible game in the forties, you don't even know, and then Sam had said something like, Oh yeah? Name three moves that would still work today. What was it, did you call your girls 'sweetheart' or 'honey' or something, haha, forties pet names, now that's something I'd like to hear--

Okay. In retrospect, Sam can totally see how he brought this whole thing upon himself.) 

The first couple of times, he had been convinced that he'd heard Bucky wrong. However, they've long since moved past the realm of plausible deniability; there are only so many ways a word can be misheard, and Sam's pretty sure that Bucky's not quite weird enough to go around calling people ""meat tart"" for no reason. 

But the thing is, he's not sure what Bucky's angling for with this. Is he doing it just to get on Sam's nerves? Is he doing it to prove some sort of weird, asinine point?

Or--

 

***

 

If he thinks about it carefully, there is a very simple explanation for all of this. For the little touches, the pet names. The staring. The soft creasing at the corners of Bucky's eyes and the shine in his gaze. The slow, sweet curve of his smile, when he thinks Sam isn't looking.

It's that--

Bucky--

 

***

 

No. Sam's overthinking it.

He has to be careful, now, in all things. Has to be careful with the shield, with the suit. With this. There's so much resting on his shoulders. 

He can't ruin this. 

He can't lose this, too. 

 

***

 

""Here,"" he says when he plunks Bucky's designated mug down in front of him. ""To quench your thirst, m'lord.""

Bucky snorts. ""Don't be weird. It's not like I ordered you to fetch water.""

""You have legs.""

Bucky aims a kick at him, but there's no heart to it; his foot only just brushes against Sam's calf, and Sam can tell he's using about one percent of his power. Barely enough to feel the impact. ""You were literally the one who asked me if I wanted anything to drink.""

""You didn't have to say you wanted anything."" 

""And, like I said, you didn't have to go get it."" 

Sam rolls his eyes and slides back into his spot on the couch, leaving the usual two-inch gap between their legs, and brings his gaze back on the tv screen. 

Bucky's quiet for a long moment. ""Cold?"" 

""Hm?""

""I saw you shiver earlier. You cold?""

""S'fine, Buck, just the air con.""

""That's what you get for turning it on so high."" Even as Bucky chastises him, he moves over to Sam on the couch; suddenly, the platonic, inches-wide no man's land between them is gone. They're close, shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh. 

Sam holds himself very still. ""Whatcha doin', Buck?""

""I run warm. Come here.""

When Sam doesn't move an inch, Bucky sighs and shuffles himself even closer, dropping a heavy arm around Sam's shoulders. ""Lazy,"" he huffs, and rubs his hand against Sam's arm, trying to warm him up. ""Wow, you're all chilly. You should've worn a long sleeve.""

""It's almost summer,"" Sam manages to say, mouth dry.

There's something happening on the tv, probably, something with running and screaming and cursing, but Sam's sure that even if Steve Roger's bare and wrinkly old ass was being scrolled across the screen like the flag during the national anthem, he wouldn't notice. He's too focused on the heat of Bucky's hand like a flame against his skin; too focused on Bucky's sharp profile, his features stark in the silver wash of the television screen; too focused on the relaxed slump of his body against Sam's little couch. Casual.

Casual, like it's just another slow evening among many, spent with Sam tucked into his side. Like it's normal.

And it is normal, Sam realizes, something sharp-toothed clawing in the pit of his stomach. This is normal for them. They've been doing it for weeks. 

""Little better?"" asks Bucky, voice low and smooth. Unnervingly intimate. 

""Yeah,"" says Sam.

Bucky hums in his throat. ""That's good, sweetheart."" 

 You're overthinking it, Sam tells himself, feeling the hot weight of Bucky's arm over his shoulder. Tells himself that again, when he feels himself nodding off against Bucky's side. And again, when he wakes for just a second, sleep-loose and tucked under his sheets.

There's a gentle hand over his cheek. 

""Shhh,"" says Bucky, voice a soft whisper in the dark. ""Just me, darlin'. I'll be on the couch."" Then, the sound of his careful tread, and the open-and-close click of the bedroom door, and then Sam has nothing else left to do but close his eyes and drift off again.

 You're overthinking it, Sam thinks again, desperate, when he remembers everything in the morning. 

Keeps repeating it, even as he feels the bottom of his stomach drop out. As if in freefall. 





FOUR

 

The air wafting from the open refrigerator is a cool reprieve from the muggy Louisiana summer. Sam only barely resists sticking his head inside to chill along with the eggs and milk, and instead snags the six pack of beer tucked behind the leftover gumbo from last night's dinner.

When he turns around to head back out into heat and comes face-to-face with his sister, he flinches so hard he nearly drops the cans on the kitchen floor. 

""Ah! Jesus,"" he wheezes, slapping a hand against his chest, ""Sarah, don't sneak up on me like that!""

Sarah stares back, unimpressed. Sam hadn't even heard her step into the kitchen. 

Heaven save him from little sisters with silent feet; when they were younger, he used to say that they needed to put a bell on her. A joke like that now would definitely get him punched in the arm, so he only ever uses it on Bucky.

When Sam's finished clutching dramatically at his side, Sarah drops her keys into the key holder on the kitchen counter with a jingling clatter and pins him in place with one look. ""So when were you gonna tell me about all that?""

""All what?"" Sam shoots back. ""More importantly, when did you get home? I didn't even hear the truck come down the driveway.""

""Mmm,"" says Sarah, crossing her arms. ""I got back just now. But you were preoccupied, I bet."" She purses her lips, too, in the universal sibling look of You know exactly what I'm talking about, and you better act like it before I show you the consequences.  

Sam frowns. Slides the six-pack onto the counter because the plastic rings are digging uncomfortably into his fingers, shakes out the chill that's settled into his hands. ""What's that supposed to mean? I just came up to grab drinks.""

""So we're gonna do it like this?"" Sarah narrows her eyes at him and puffs up. ""Fine! First of all, Sam, you know I love having you home, but you gotta start giving me warning in advance if we're gonna have guests! I only left the house for three hours, and you didn't tell me anything, so imagine my surprise when, the second I pull into the driveway, the boys come running up to me and tell me that 'Mr. Bucky' has come round to visit again!""

Sam winces, and suppresses the urge to twist his hands into his t-shirt like he's eight and just knocked over Sarah's art project. ""Okay, I'm sorry. I should've told you, but he didn't really give me any notice, either--""

""Samuel Thomas Wilson, I am not done speaking.  Second of all--and this one's the bigger offense, in my opinion--when exactly were you planning on telling me that you've finally sealed the deal with that boy? My God, I mean, I'm not surprised, it sure took you long enough, but I would've thought that you'd tell your only sister that you've finally gotten yourself a boyfriend--""

""Hold on, hold on, hold on,"" Sam says. ""A  what?"" 

""Your boyfriend. Your boy toy. That hunk of vanilla wafer that follows you everywhere, whatever you wanna call him. Don't treat me like I'm stupid, Sam, it's not cute.""

""I don't--he's not my boyfriend! And what do you mean, I'm not surprised?"" 

""Don't be coy with me,"" Sarah huffs. When Sam stares at her bewilderment, she blows out a long, agitated breath and starts bustling around the kitchen, taking down a glass and pouring herself sweet tea from the pitcher in the fridge. 

""Well, first of all, when y'all were fixing up the boat? I was there, too, and I got eyes, just in case you forgot. And then there's just now--Cass and AJ told me, and this is verbatim, 'Mr. Bucky called Uncle Sam sweetheart and then touched his cheek and it looked like they were gonna kiss.'""

Sam splutters.

""There was dirt on my face, he was just getting it off! And the name thing is just an--inside joke! And, also, the boys shouldn't be going around spying on people--""

""They're kids. That's like asking the sun not to shine,"" Sarah says, and takes a drink.

""Well, they shouldn't do it anyway.""

Sarah glares at him over the rim of her cup. ""Look, Sam, I'm happy for you. You don't have to hide these things around me. But if you're really gonna have your boy over just to let him mack on you in our boat, I'm gonna have to ask you to save that for when you're back at your own place.""

""It's not like that,"" Sam says. ""We're not like that. Besides--you saw him when he was over fixing the boat, talking you up like nobody's business, even after I told him to stop, and at the cookout--""

""Oh, so you're gonna gatekeep my love life now? Don't pull that 'man of the family' bullshit with me.""

Sam winces. ""You know I didn't mean it like that..""

Sarah steps forward, jaw set. ""Who let your teenaged ass cry on her shoulder after you were rejected by Maria from down the street? Who covered for you in high school when you snuck out while you were grounded to go on a date with Benjamin, the one with all the piercings?""

""You did,"" Sam says meekly. 

""That's right. Yes, Sam, your boy flirted with me for a day or two! That's because he's got taste, come on, look at me.""

""Sarah--""

""Let me finish. If you really had eyes, you'd have seen that between the two of us, I'm not the one he was showboating for!"" Sarah tilts her head then, dipping her voice down low into an exaggerated Brooklyn drawl. ""Hey, Sammy, want me to help you lift that with my big strong muscles? Ooh, let me touch up all over your body--but I'm just movin' around ya on this little cramped boat. Don't mind me. Hey, darlin', I'll screw that tighter for you, and if you want, I can also screw y--""

""He doesn't sound like that,"" Sam interrupts, face feeling red-hot. He's thought about that day a few times too many for it to be something so easily brushed off, but that's his business. ""Okay, you've made your point. But it's not like that.""

Sarah drops the accent instantly, face serious. ""Okay. Then tell me how it is.""

""We're friends,"" Sam insists. 

""A friend who practically lives in your apartment, even though he has his own place? Every single time I've facetimed you, he's been there in the background.""

""Bucky doesn't sleep well when he's alone.""

Sarah closes her eyes. ""Lord, give me patience.""

Sam drums his fingers nervously against the counter, heart pounding. The beer cans are gathering condensation in the wet heat; Bucky's probably still waiting for him out there. He's been gone for longer than expected.

""I'm not falling for this bullshit, Sam. I know you like him. He brought one damn cake to the cookout and you spent the rest of the night hanging off his shoulders! And he's worse! Follows you around like a puppy. Stares at you like you hung the moon.""

""I--""

""And the pet names, for crying out loud! What is with that?""

 It's an inside joke,  Sam thinks about saying again.  It's supposed to be funny, okay? Because Bucky calls me sweetheart but I'm not actually his sweetheart, ha-ha. It's not for real.  

""Sam,"" says Sarah, insistent. 

Something sour curdles in his stomach. 

""I don't know,"" he gets out. ""But it's not--he's not looking for something like that, not after all he's been through. I know that. I won't do that to him.""

""Sam, I know you. I know you've gotta be seeing everything that I've been seeing. Why won't you just admit it? Why are you making it so hard?""

Sam's ribs draw tight. He bites the inside of his cheek, feels the sharp sting of his teeth against flesh. Almost draws blood.  I won't ruin it, he thinks fiercely.  I won't lose him, too.  

Sarah's eyes have gone soft with worry. ""Tell me. What's the real problem here?""

Sam looks away.

 

***

 

""Sam,"" says Sarah, quiet. ""Is this about Riley?""

 

***

 

When Sam first returned to Louisiana from Afghanistan, all those years ago, he spent day after day just going through the motions. Barely eating, barely sleeping. Gritting his teeth through the nights. Biting his tongue when he woke, so the whole house wouldn't wake with him. 

A month in, Sarah found him in the dark kitchen at 4am, standing on colt-wobbly legs and clutching at a maple-glazed donut like it was the last thing tying him to the world. She had brought a dozen home from the bakery that afternoon.

When she asked him what he was doing, he turned to her, eyes red, and replied:  Riley said that when he came back home, this was the first thing he wanted to eat. That dumbass.  His voice cracked as he spoke.  That fucking dumbass. It's not even that good.  

Then, he broke down in Sarah's arms like he was a little boy again, barefoot on the cool kitchen tile and covered in nightmare-sweat. Gasped and shook, his heart shuddering like it would spill right out of his chest. Felt Sarah's arms wrap tighter around him as he soaked his tears into the cotton of her t-shirt. 

He said,  I was up there just to watch. 

He said,  They had to drive around in a humvee just to collect all the pieces of him. Like a damn treasure hunt.  

He said, I was scared. I was weak. It could have been me. There was nothing I could do. Maybe there was. Maybe if I hadn't been so afraid of being hit. Maybe if I hadn't tried to save myself. Maybe if I had flown lower--if I had dived faster--I could have-- 

 

***

 

The kitchen is a still cocoon around them. The dimming light spills, warm and mellow, from the windows in slanting streams. There are no nightmares here. 

""There are more ways to be hurt,"" says Sarah, ""than just losing someone.""

Sam watches a water droplet slide down a beer can. 

""You can't keep the world on your shoulders forever, Sam. Let yourself come first. Let yourself have this, just for once."" 

 

***

 

When he finally heads back down to the boat, Bucky's propped up against a stack of boxes on the end of the dock, watching the sun sink down into the horizon with his feet dangling over the water. 

Sam doesn't bother sneaking up behind him, both because the floorboards of the dock creak like a haunted house in the wind and because Bucky's super-hearing is too good for that to ever happen. When he wrestles a can out from the pack rings and presses the cool metal to the back of Bucky's neck, he doesn't even flinch. 

""Thanks, sweetheart,"" Bucky says, and snatches it away to pop the tab. ""You took a while. Got lost on the way to your own kitchen, huh? Knew all those knocks to the head would come back to bite you eventually.""

Just for that, Sam slams his knee into Bucky's back as he settles himself down on the jumble of boxes.

""Oof,"" Bucky grunts, more for show than out of actual pain. He puts his hand onto the bony knob of Sam's kneecap. ""Watch where you're putting those,"" he gripes, and then he slings his arm across Sam's lap, props his head up with his hand, and makes himself comfortable.

Sam stares down at where the vulnerable curve of Bucky's ribs is pressing hard into his thigh. Tears his gaze away, over the slow play of muscle under Bucky's worn henley, and instead focuses his eyes on the little whorl of hair on the top of Bucky's head.

""Watch where you're putting  yourself,"" he says faintly. ""Not everyone is patient enough to be your armrest.""

Bucky looks up at that. He grins up at Sam with his stupid white teeth and stupid blue eyes, and, god--

""Good thing I have you, then,"" he laughs, and Sam feels like he's burning up. 





FIVE

 

Sam's not the type of person who goes on their phone first thing in the morning--no, he leaves that up to Bucky, who, always and without fail, pulls his phone out as soon as he's had his first cup of coffee and props his feet up on Sam's nice chairs to scroll through like it's the Sunday paper. 

It makes sense, then, that he doesn't see the notification for Sarah's text until he's already finished his morning run.

""Hey,"" Bucky says, mid-yawn, and Sam looks up from his phone. Bucky is shuffling through the entranceway to the kitchen, hair wet and dripping on his shoulders. ""Shower's open now. You're almost out of body wash, by the way, I'll pick some up from the store when I get groceries.""

Sam tries not to stare too long at the flush of heat spreading across his pale skin. It's nice to see him like this, soft and shower-fresh and wandering around Sam's kitchen in soft sweats and a t-shirt, squinting into the morning light. He looks like he's at home.

""Okay,"" says Sam when he thinks he's been silent for too long. He does his best not to muse over when exactly Bucky started buying his groceries for him, and redirects his attention back to Sarah's text. 

The timestamp is from an hour ago. Sam scrolls down, water cup still halfway to his lips. 

 


 Sarah 



 Did you see this? 



 Text me back when you're done freaking out. Or laughing. Or both.  


 

She's attached a link in her next text. Vaguely curious, Sam clicks it, blinking through the sweat that's dripping in his eyes, and a website pops up with a video. 

It's on autoplay, and stereotypical peppy intro music starts blaring through the kitchen.

""And you call me an old man,"" says Bucky from where he's settled himself at the kitchen table. He always sits facing the window, because he likes watching the sun come in over the roofs of the city buildings. ""Who's the one who's playing the news loudly on their phone at the breakfast table with no headphones on?"" 

""I'm not at the table, I'm at the counter,"" Sam retorts. ""And you're giving me an awful lot of lip for someone who was just whining earlier about how my couch gives you backaches. Shut up and eat your cornflakes, geezer.""

""Fuck you.""

""You wish.""

When Bucky doesn't say anything in return, Sam focuses his attention back on the video. The colorful intro banner fades away to be replaced with a blonde news anchor with a Colgate commercial smile. 

Sam frowns--he can already tell that this isn't the type of news that Sarah usually listens to. It looks like the online version of People magazine, or any other trashy news source lying around any clinic waiting room in America. He's about to exit out of the page and nag at Sarah for becoming a gossip-rag-follower when a voice starts piping out of his phone's speaker. 

""Breaking news on our favorite superhero couple,"" says the host of the show, bright and plasticky under the studio lights. ""That's right, folks! We've got solid evidence that the Cap and Winter Soldier romance is real--""

Sam's finger slams down on the pause button.

 What,  he thinks,  the hell. 

There's a graphic frozen on-screen, superimposed over the feed of the news anchor in the studio. It's an awful paparazzi photo of him and Bucky, somewhere on the streets of New York, looking like they'd both just gone three days straight without sleep--Bucky's hand, resting casually on Sam's waist, is circled in red. Just in case the viewers couldn't tell where to look, based on the ten arrows also edited to point in that direction. 

Emoji hearts have been added onto the border of the photo. Sam closes his eyes.

There's the clink of a spoon knocking against ceramic.

""Don't stop on my account,"" says Bucky from behind him, and Sam snaps out of his stupor--and remembers, with another cold wash of horror, that he isn't alone. ""Play your news.""


 Fuck. 


Full-body cringe already engaged, Sam turns his head just the slightest bit to assess the damage. Bucky's still at the kitchen table, facing away, so Sam can't see his expression--he can't tell if that's for the better or for the worse--but the broad stretch of his shoulders is looking awfully stiff, and he's gone still as a statue. 

His spoon is resting silently against the side of his cereal bowl, abandoned. The cornflakes are going to go soggy. 

""I--""

""Just watch your damn video, Sam.""

Sam closes his mouth, helpless. Presses play. Watches his damn video. 

The anchor's voice washes over him, each sentence more damning than the last. He's horribly aware of Bucky on the other side of the kitchen, silent and almost definitely listening along; the plasticky case of Sam's phone keeps slipping in his suddenly-sweaty hands. His neck prickles. 

""--seen visiting the grocery store together--""

""--Barnes reportedly staying overnight--""

""--looking cozy--Wilson family home--""

Just when Sam thinks that the video is over, the anchor shuffles her papers, delivers a bright smile to the camera, and says, ""Now, onto our viewers' favorite segment! Here's this week's photo updates with Captain Wilson and Sergeant Barnes!""

A slideshow of paparazzi photos starts playing.

There are a lot  of photos. As the slideshow keeps going, complete with shitty high-school-presentation style dissolve transitions, Sam feels his shoulders hitch up higher and higher around his ears. He doesn't want to be watching this. It's humiliating, it's ridiculous, it's--

""So,"" says Bucky's voice, closer than expected. Sam jumps, whips his head around to see Bucky peering over his shoulder--he hadn't realized Bucky had even gotten up from the table. ""What's that all about, huh?""

Sam scrambles backwards, tries to regain his composure. ""So,"" he says stiffly. ""According to the Internet, we're an item.""

""According to more than just the Internet, I'd think,"" says Bucky, nonchalant, and wait, what?

""What's that supposed to mean,"" says Sam, sweat going cold on his skin.

""I'm just saying,"" Bucky says with a shrug--but his eyes are sharp. Assessing. It sets Sam on edge. ""No one's been particularly subtle about it, either.""

""Wha--who?""

""Well, first of all--remember Leah?""

Sam gapes. ""From Izzy's? I only met her once!""

Bucky shrugs again, and shifts his weight to lean against the cabinet next to the stove. ""Well, that was enough to make an impression, I'm guessing. She thought that I ditched her during our date because I was pining over you.""

Sam stares. ""You weren't even  talking  to me then.""

Bucky looks away, chagrined. ""Yeah, you don't need to rub it in, I'm sorry, okay?""

""Forget that. Who else?""

""Uhhh."" Bucky makes a face like he's ticking off a mental list. ""Torres. Sharon.""

""Torres?! He hasn't said a single thing to me! And how do you know Sharon th--""

""I have super hearing, sweetheart. She called you during our last movie night, I was literally in the other room. And as for Torres--"" Bucky snorts, a dark look entering his eyes. ""Well, he wouldn't say stuff like that to his childhood crush, would he.""

""Okay, well, none of this means anyth--""

Bucky gives him a long, hard look. ""Your sister, too.""

Sam is caught so off-guard that he blurts out, ""What? The house is at least a five minute walk away from the dock, how could you have heard that?"" before he can stop himself. In the next second, he realizes exactly how incriminating that sounds.

Bucky's eyes widen to dinner plates. It would be funny if Sam wasn't currently trying to sink through the floor. ""What?"". 

""Nothing,"" Sam says, wishing he had his wings on so he could just soar out the window and never come back. ""Forget it.""

""No, I mean--I texted her--Sam, were you talking to your sister about me?""

""That's none of your business!"" Sam scrambles for an escape from the hole he's digging, feeling desperate. ""Why were you texting her?""

A line forms in between Bucky's eyebrows. ""You were acting off after we visited your sister, that one time, so I just wanted to make sure nothing bad happened.""

""I visited. You gatecrashed."" 

""Whatever. But your sister said something to me, you know. Said that you might take a while to come around. But that she knew I'd get through to you eventually.""

""She--why does everyone think you're trying to date me?""

""Why,"" Bucky bursts out, throwing his hands in the air, ""do you think that I'm  not?""

Silence. 

Sam feels the breath catch in his throat. 

Just a few steps away, Bucky runs a hand over his face, chest heaving. ""Sam,"" he says through gritted teeth, ""you're taking the birdbrain thing too seriously. Are you really this dense?"" 

Sam opens his mouth. Closes it. Hears his pulse pounding in his ears like a drum. 

""Look at us. You've said it so many times; I'm practically living in your apartment. I've met your family a billion times. You keep fancy shampoos in your shower when I know you don't use them yourself. You run the coffeemaker for me in the morning, even on the days when you're just having tea."" Bucky's really getting agitated now, body practically vibrating, like he really wants to pace back and forth but is holding himself back from doing that. 

""Buck...""

""I've haven't been hiding it, either. Sam, do you think I flirt with you just for fun?"" Bucky slumps a little then, fiddles with his fingers in the way that Sam's come to associate with nerves. Eventually settles on clenching his flesh hand over his vibranium one, knuckles bleaching white with tension. ""If you don't feel the same way, that's fine. I just--I really like you. You're so sharp, Sam, I thought you would've caught on by now.""

Sam swallows loudly. 

The thing is.

 The thing is--

Sam did catch on. Sam did know. Sam knew this whole time, probably; could feel it in his blood, every time Bucky's blue eyes caught his gaze and sent his heart into a frenzy like he was tumbling from the sky. Could feel every sudden drop, every dizzying lurch when their hands brushed over their cups, when they shared laughter in the sun, when Bucky's arm settled warm and comforting over his own body. When Bucky stayed up with him, silent, after he woke in the night mid-scream. When Bucky would say his name like that, soft, and smile at him like he couldn't help it. 

It was clear as day, in the end. Sam just didn't want to look. 

Bucky's still standing there, shuffling. Every second of silence makes him wilt a little further.

Sam sets his jaw. 

Thinks about Bucky, and the way he fits into Sam's life like a puzzle piece.

Decides to let himself have this, just for once. 

""I do,"" he says, and saying it out loud feels like taking a hammer to the thick ice of a frozen lake. Something deep inside cracks open, and the truth wells out, clear and piercing. It feels--terrifying, he thinks. Terrifying, but good. 

Bucky's head snaps up.

""Come again?"" he croaks.

""I do,"" Sam says again, heart racing. ""I do feel the same.""

Bucky steps forward, tentative. ""Sam,"" he whispers, voice unsteady. Hopeful. ""Why didn't you ever say something?""

Sam wets his lips. ""I didn't want to risk it,"" he admits. "" You weren't ready, and I was scared. I didn't wanna put all that on you.""

Another step. Bucky's hands are shaking. ""You gotta let me make that decision for myself.""

""I know. I'm sorry.""

They're just a step apart now.

""Sam,"" Bucky gets out. He's swaying forward on his feet. ""I'm gonna--I gotta--will you let me--""

""Okay,"" says Sam.

Bucky shudders. ""I didn't even say what I wanted to do. It could be anything.""

""I know,"" Sam breathes. ""And I'll say it again: okay.""

Bucky freezes, just for a second--and within the next breath, he's in Sam's space, has him up against the kitchen counter.

There isn't much talking for a long time. 

""Wait,"" Sam gasps, when Bucky finally lets him breathe and he's able to use his brain for more than just concentrating on the softness of his lips. ""I'm all sweaty--you just showered--""

""Fuck that,"" Bucky mutters into his neck. ""I've been wanting to do this for months. I don't care if you're sweaty.""

""Well then--""

Bucky nips at the tender spot behind his ear. ""Let me have my moment, Sam.""

Sam pulls on the back of Bucky's shirt collar until he comes away, pouting. 

""I was gonna say,"" Sam pants, trying to sound stern even as he feels Bucky's hands creeping back around him, ""that you can have your moment somewhere more comfortable.""

Bucky blinks at him, face flushed.

Sam raises a brow. ""I have a bedroom.""

""Oh.  Oh."" Bucky presses in closer. Puts his hands under Sam's thighs and lifts, and wow, Sam knew he was strong, but he still feels his stomach flip. 

Bucky's smile is sweet and sharp and almost too much. ""Sweetheart,"" he says, brilliant, ""I thought you'd never ask.""





(+1) SIX

 

Of all the bars Sam has entered in his life, this is definitely one of the nicer ones. 

The flashing neon lights from the dancefloor could be a little more forgiving, though, so for the sake of his eyesight he keeps his eyes down and focuses on nursing the overpriced martini he has in front of him.

He's almost finished his drink when the chair next to him screeches against the floor, high and grating above the throbbing bassline of the music. 

Sam looks up. 

""Hey, there. What's a looker like you doin' all alone in a place like this?"" Blue eyes twinkle in the dim bar lighting. 

Sam fights back a burst of laughter. When he regains some measure of control over his face, he answers, ""Not alone, thanks. I'm waiting on someone.""

A wide, white grin. ""They've kept you waiting an awful long time, I'd think.""

Sam traces his fingers through the condensation on his glass. ""What can I say? He's a busy guy. Worth waiting for, though."" 

A raised brow. ""Really?""

""Mm-hm. Y'know, he's kinda sensitive. Don't think he'll take too kindly to walking in and seeing you hanging over here. Why don't you--""

A heavy hand falls between Sam's shoulder blades. ""I dunno,"" murmurs the low voice against his ear. ""I don't think I should. Only a fool would flake on a face like yours. How 'bout you come with me, honey, and I can show you a good evening?"" 

The hand creeps lower, inching toward the small of Sam's back--

""Hey, is this guy bothering you?""

Sam jerks, startled. So does the body behind him. 

The bartender, who Sam could've sworn was just standing all the way at the other end of the bar, has apparently teleported in front of them. She's glaring, fierce and sharp--not at him, but at Bucky, who's practically plastered himself to Sam's back.

""Uh,"" says Sam.

""I heard you, asshole,"" the bartender says to Bucky. She has one hand under the counter. ""You're getting awfully pushy with someone who isn't interested. I can have security over here in five seconds with just the press of a button--""

""No, wait,"" Sam rushes to explain. ""He's not bothering me--I'm so sorry, you don't need to call security."" 

The bartender narrows her eyes. ""You're sure?""

""Yes!"" The security at this bar couldn't take Bucky anyway, Sam does not say. ""I was waiting for him, he just decided to act like an idiot. We're here for our anniversary. Thank you for checking up on me, though.""

At the word 'anniversary,' the bartender's face lights up. ""Oh,"" she laughs, ""sorry about that! You can never be too safe. Have a good one, you guys.""

As soon as she disappears off to the other end of the bar, Sam buries his face in his hands. 

""That was so--you are the worst,"" he says, muffled. ""You are the most ridiculous person alive. Stop laughing!""

Bucky unearths himself from Sam's shoulder, face red with mingled amusement and embarrassment. 

""I can't believe that just happened,"" he gasps.

Helpless, Sam feels the corners of his mouth twitch up. ""Man,"" he huffs, ""you really tried to be smooth, and look where it got us. That was incredibly humiliating for you, I think. You may never recover."" 

""Hey, you played along. It's been a while since we've roleplayed in a place like this, you know,"" says Bucky, eyebrow raised. ""How about this, you can be the Smiling Tiger, and I can be your stoic bodyguard--""

""I hate you.""

""Oh!"" Bucky brings a hand to his chest, looking wounded. ""Rebuffed by my sweetheart on the anniversary of our joining--""

""Shut the hell up,"" Sam laughs, slapping at him. ""What's gotten into you today? Why are you being so sappy?""

Bucky smiles like a fool, eyes crinkling. ""I can't be sappy,"" he says, sliding his hand over Sam's nape, ""when I've got Captain America himself waiting for me on our anniversary, looking like a snack?""

Sam almost collapses in laughter again. ""What in the--where did you learn that from?""

Bucky blinks. ""AJ and Cass."" 

""Okay, one: don't ever say that again. You sound like a pervy old man."" Sam dodges the swat to his cheek and delivers a counterattack in the form of a pinch to Bucky's side, and then grins when Bucky flinches back and knocks his elbow on the bar top. ""Two: you're damn lucky Captain America is giving you and your wandering hands the time of day when you ate the last yogurt this morning. I was saving that, you asshole.""

""Aww, c'mon, are you really gonna keep holding onto that? I was running late.""

""It was the strawberry mousse, babe. The symmetry of my face has been offset through deprivation."" 

""Oh no,"" sighs Bucky. ""Your perfect face. We can't have that.""

""Yeah?"" Sam leans in, smug. ""You think my face is perfect? You think I'm the most beautiful man alive?""

Bucky takes five seconds to scan over his body, looks Sam dead in the face, and then says, ""Actually, your forehead could be a little smaller--okay, haha, sorry! It was a joke, darlin', don't push me. How about this, I'll make it up to you when we get home."" He winks, greasily charming. ""I wasn't lying about showing you a good evening."" 

""That was awful,"" Sam says, but he's smiling. ""I don't know why I bring you anywhere.""

""'Cause you love me,"" Bucky says. Tips his head down for a kiss, eager as a puppy.

""Yeah,"" Sam laughs, and leans in. ""I do.""

It's AJ who asks, with his mouth full of food and pointing at Bucky with his fork. Sarah chokes on her water and Bucky's eyes divert to Sam, who looks back with wide eyes. There is a small smile playing on his lips, though, and Bucky feels his face heat up. 

He turns to the boy, clears his throat and shakes his head. ""Uh, no, we're not."" 

AJ looks... disappointed? He is frowning with his whole face, still watching Bucky. ""What do you mean?""

And what the hell is Bucky supposed to answer that? Sam is shaking with laughter next to him and Sarah is still coughing and Bucky wants to disappear under the table away from the prying eyes.

""Uh, well,"" Bucky starts and then shuts up to find the words. He turns his eyes to Sam, who just smiles. Stupid Sam.

Cass points at him with a knife. ""Mr. Jones called uncle Bucky Mr. Wilson,"" he says matter-of-factly, while Sarah takes the knife out of the kid's hands. Cass takes a mouthful of the food and then continues, ""And I heard Mrs. Williams say uncle Sam and uncle Bucky act like an old married couple, and that it's weird because they've only seen uncle Bucky twice.""

It's Bucky's turn to choke on the bite of food he'd just taken. Sam pats him roughly on the back, still a smile on his face. 

""Did they, now?"" Sarah asks and eyes Bucky and Sam with a grin on her face. Bucky has never felt this small. Cass and AJ are both nodding.

This is not what he expected when Sam had texted him about the cookout. 'I know I said separate vacations, but we have a cookout this Saturday. Come?,' the text had said. Bucky had answered with a thumbs up emoji and booked his flights right away. 

Bucky has packed enough to stay. 

""Well,"" Bucky says again. ""Uh, we're not. Married.""

Sam snorts and finally decides to back him up. ""Yeah, we're not. It's quite early for that.""

Bucky jerks his head to gape at Sam, million questions in his eyes. Early. The clear implications of Sam's wording hang in the air and Sam just shrugs, but almost shyly. Bucky frowns and focuses back on his food just as AJ continues the conversation. 

""Will you get married?"" AJ asks and Bucky ignores the question, very aware of the redness of his face. If he's lucky, everyone just thinks it's because of the coughing fit. 

""Shush,"" Sarah saves them from answering. She shoots a look at Sam that Bucky doesn't quite understand, but Sam seems to, judging from the nod he gives her. AJ shrugs and goes back to his food. 

They get interrupted with some couple Bucky doesn't know, but that seem to know him, and who weirdly enough tell him they're glad he's there. Bucky thanks them awkwardly, following the conversation Sam is having with the pair with only half of his attention. Sam is so in his element here, it makes him seem younger. Sam is in his element in the sky, too, flying and in the battle, but this is so different. Sam is beautiful. 

The thought hits Bucky right in the chest and it's hard to breathe. 

The couple leaves and Sam places a hand gently on Bucky's leg to get his attention and jerks his head towards the boat. Bucky nods and digs his hands in his pockets as they get up. 

They walk to the boat in silence, Sam's hand on Bucky's back to guide them through the crowd of people. Instead of going inside, Sam sits on the edge of the deck. Bucky sits next to him, and while Sam's eyes are on the water, Bucky's eyes are on Sam. 

""I'm glad you came,"" Sam says quietly, still not looking at Bucky. There's a smile on his face. ""The boys love you. And everyone else, too."" 

Bucky feels content. Delacroix feels home, and it scares the hell out of him.

""Yeah,"" Bucky says, shoots a look at the direction of the tables and the crowd. ""Exactly when did I become uncle Bucky?"" 

""Sarah calls you that around the boys. I told her not to in case it weirds you out, but since you helped with the boat, you've basically become family. There's no stopping Sarah."" Sam laughs softly. Bucky leans closer to brush their shoulders together. 

""I like it,"" he whispers. 

Sam finally turns to look at him, and Bucky flashes him a genuine smile. Sam looks happy and Bucky wants to kiss him. 

Shit, he really does. 

It's not the first time Bucky has thought of it, but every time it gets more real. Bucky lets out a shaky breath. 

""Married, huh?"" he asks with a laugh, maybe to break the moment with a joke. A bad one, though, as it turns out that Sam looks almost flustered hearing the word. 

""Sorry about that,"" Sam says. ""The people here can be a bit much. And jump into conclusions. But they are good people, don't mean it in a bad way."" 

""Never thought they would,"" Bucky said, then grins. ""And to be fair, we do act like an old married couple, sometimes.""

Sam laughs loudly at that, and it carries over the water. He is fidgeting with his fingers and they fall into a comfortable silence. It's what Bucky thinks both of them need right now, a moment of quiet before jumping straight back into the crowd of people. 

""Sam, I-,"" Bucky breaks the silence, but his voice betrays him. Sam places his hand on top of Bucky's left one. Bucky feels the pressure, the warmth. When he talks, he talks quickly, but with a soft voice, ""Please tell me I'm not-, not imagining this. Us. Because I thought I was hoping too much, but hell. Your nephews call me uncle too, and the whole town thinks there's something."" 

Sam shakes his head, squeezes Bucky's vibranium arm tighter.  ""No,"" he breathes out, ""you're not. Imagining it."" 

Bucky turns his hand slightly to tangle their fingers together. He stares at the clasped hands for a while. 

This is real. They are real. 

""I'd like to stay,"" Bucky whispers. ""I don't need to go back, I have nothing left there. Here, here I have you. I'd love to have all of you, if you'll just take me."" 

Sam is watching him with an intense look. If Bucky was standing, he'd not be anymore - he wants to melt under the gaze. 

""Please,"" Sam answers just as quietly, taking in a sharp breath. ""Stay.""

Bucky's heart is trying to escape his chest as leans in closer, looks at Sam straight in the eyes. ""Kiss me, Sam Wilson."" 

Sam kisses him. He does it with intent, his lips are soft against Bucky's and his hand is cupping Bucky's jaw. They fit together and Bucky is left breathless, leaning their foreheads together with still closed eyes. It's not a long kiss, but it holds emotion Bucky can't describe. He feels overwhelmed by it. 

""Shit,"" Bucky says with a short laugh. ""Shit, Sam.""

""Yeah."" Sam lets out a giggle and Bucky's fingers find his waist, just to touch, take Sam in. He wants all of Sam, all of the life Sam is welcoming him in. He wants it all. 

""We should've done this weeks ago,"" Bucky murmurs. ""Shit.""

He wants to stay there forever. 

""I thought only married people kiss,"" AJ's voice says behind them, and Bucky bursts into a genuine laugh, leaning back away from Sam. Sam is smiling too. 

""Not married, kid,"" Bucky says, ""but you'll be the first one to know once that's a thing."" 

AJ seems happy with the answer and crawls to sit between them, holding on to Bucky's left arm. 

Yeah, Bucky likes it there. "

No.  Wait.  Sam knows exactly how this is his life and it's on his fucking left.  

""There has got to be another way.""  He groans, pinching the bridge of his nose.  

But Steve just laughs, shaking his head.  ""SHIELD isn't interested until we can prove something nefarious is actually going on.  Natasha and Clint are overseas. Bruce doesn't have the temperament for this kind of undercover op and Tony and I, well.""

""I know.  I know.  You're Steve and Tony.  Constantly in the limelight and no good for undercover.  I get it.""  Sam gets up and heads to the kitchen, going through his fridge and making a mental inventory of the shit he's going to have to toss if he's going to be gone for any length of time.  

It's not much.

""It's not just that, it's that it's a marriage retreat, Sam - for troubled couples.  And while no one who read the tabloids would question us being at something like that, we aren't married.  So we don't qualify and everyone knows it.""  Steve had followed Sam and is now leaning back against the counter with his arms folded across his chest looking like he's trying his best to achieve friendly encouragement rather than authoritative. ""You guys have stayed completely under the radar as Avengers, your identities still completely secret and personal lives a mystery to everyone.  No one even knows what the two of you look like without your uniforms and masks.""

Sam shuts the refrigerator and turns to give Steve one last, exasperated plea.

""Yeah, but Bucky?""

The damn mischievous smile he gets in answer makes Sam almost wish he had picked a different monument to run around the day they met.

Almost.

 

***

See, the problem isn't that Sam doesn't like Bucky, or that he thinks there's anything wrong or that Bucky can't handle it.

The problem is exactly the opposite.  

Sam does like Bucky.  Sam really likes Bucky.  They've been a constant staple in each other's lives for almost three years.  In the beginning he had crashed at Sam's place when things got to be too much, slept in his guest room more often than not for what felt like forever.  He talked to Sam - and he guessed it was because he was a damn good listener - about the things he was scared to bring up with Steve, about memories he wasn't sure of, about the things he feared about rejoining the world.  He told him the good things and the bad things, the terrors he remembered in broken bits and pieces from his decades of being a one man weapon of mass destruction.  

Each time he opened up, Sam fell a little bit harder.  

And felt guiltier about it every time. Because all he could think was that if he ever said anything, ever asked for anything more than the friendship they had developed, it would be taking advantage of Bucky in the worst way imaginable.

It was easier, after moving to New York and into the Avengers tower.  At least after that they had their own apartments, even if they were on the same floor.  Of course, that fact hadn't stopped Bucky from constantly barging in on him, spending all his free time on Sam's couch anyway, or stealing half of his food when he thought Sam wasn't looking.

""Are you gonna help with these bags or what, Thomas?""  Bucky pulls a duffle out of the trunk and tosses it right at Sam's chest which he catches with a roll of his eyes.

""Look, James, don't be so damn pushy.  I'm barely even out of the car.""  He tosses it over his shoulder and watches Bucky discreetly check his flesh replica glove, tucked far underneath the long sleeve of his Henley.  His Henley that is just tight enough and unbuttoned enough to reveal way too much skin for Sam's sanity.  Not to mention the fact that he's in hip hugger skinny jeans and has his hair flipped off to the side with just a touch of product in it.

Steve may have rejected modern fashion but Bucky had embraced it whole heartedly.

Thank God.

Bucky laughs at him, slinging his own bag over his shoulder and heading towards the main hall.  He watches him go, biting at his bottom lip while he tries to look anywhere but at just how tight the man's jeans actually are and failing miserably.

It's going to be a long damn week.

***

The retreat is really a glorified summer camp, complete with way too fucking perky councilors and organized activities that make Sam want to gag.  Every couple has their own private cabin that's decorated in such a way that makes him never ever want to see the 'down home' decor again in his life.

And they've only been there a few hours.

At least the entertainment sucks too.

Bucky is rolling his eyes at the poorly acted introduction film so hard Sam can almost feel it.  ""I can think of about two dozen other things I would rather be doing right now than watching this shit.""

""Oh?""

Sam finds a heavy hand sliding down his thigh to rest at his knee, fingers playing around the joint in a teasing motion.  His gaze follows Bucky's arm up to find a sly grin.  ""Oh?""  He repeats, mouth going dry but keeping his cool.   They're in the back of the room and the movie is loud enough that if they're careful they won't be heard.   Even still he leans in close, whispering just against Bucky's ear.  ""Like going to do an initial survey of the area?""

""I was thinking of just necking in the back row.""  Bucky replies with a smirk and a wink.

Sam is gonna kill Steve.

""We are supposed to be married, after all.""  Bucky tries again, squeezing the hand around Sam's knee a little tighter, his words warm against his skin.

Swallowing, Sam shakes his head.  ""With serious marriage issues, remember?""

""Oh come on.  Look at us and tell me we don't have smoking hot hate sex after every single argument.""

Images of being pinned against a wall, of biting and bruising and holding limbs too tight, of sweat soaked hair and bodies moving together threaten to overtake him and full body shudder goes down Sam's spine.

Luckily, the lights switch on before he can give himself away and Perky Councilor #8 starts talking at the front of the room.

""Don't forget we have a job to do, Bucky.""  He says as evenly as he can manage before slipping just an inch to his left and out of Bucky's grasp.

Sam doesn't hear the frustrated sigh next to him.

***

By the second day they have a solid grasp on who is in charge, the lay out of the general camp, and have met and effectively schmoozed with the owner of the Retreat.  Bucky had laid on the charm pretty heavily which was a sight to behold, especially since a little over a year ago he would barely put two words together in front of someone he didn't know and trust.  His smile was just as beautiful as always and Sam had to remind himself every couple of minutes they were there for a reason.

But the scheduled activities went on, and they have a cover to keep.

So, dancing lessons.

He's pressed tightly against Bucky, their hands threaded together, Sam's arm around his waist, moving with the instructors words and trying really very hard to ignore the absolute bullshit that is their 'counseling' suggestions for what to be thinking about while doing it.  Sam uses that term very loosely, as these people are about as qualified to being marriage counselors as he is to be a fucking ballerina.

""This is not dancing.""  Bucky laments for the third time with an eye roll.

""Be nice, James.  This is one of the reason's we're here.  You can never just get along and go with the flow.""

Bucky tuts and falls quiet for the rest of the song.  But when the next one starts with barely a pause he seems to have met his end.  He moves out of rhythm, pulling Sam with him and lowering his hand to rest low on Sam's hip, fingers dancing just along the top of his ass.  ""I can show you how to dance, baby.""

They move a little faster, to whatever rhythm is in Bucky's head, stepping this way and that around the floor and around the other couples who are looking just as bored as they were mere moments before.  Sam goes with it, pushing out all the negative thoughts and the 'shouldn't' and 'cant's' and just enjoys himself for a brief period of time.  His body is guided around easily by Bucky's, smiling and laughing like they were really a couple getting lost on the dance floor.

""It appears the Buchanan's seemed to have figured everything out on their own.""

The condescending voice brings Sam's high crashing down and their momentary escape from reality to a halt.

Sam clears his throat, purposely grabbing Bucky's hand and putting it back on his shoulder where it belongs.  ""Sorry, ma'am.""

She gives them a long, stern look, causing them both to shuffle back to the other side of the room and rejoin the ranks of mindless minions.

When they're out of range and hopefully under the radar once again, Bucky leans in close.  ""What was that ladies name again?""

""Madame Buzzkill."" Sam replies immediately, moving his hand down Bucky's side just enough to rest at his hip instead of his waist and grinning widely.

Bucky's laugh is such a beautiful sound.

 

***

Given that it's a couple's retreat it isn't too terribly surprising there's only one bed.  Very incredibly diplomatically they had decided they would switch.   The first night Sam took the bed while Bucky curled up on the love seat with an extra blanket.  It worked well.  Both were used to sleeping in worse circumstances and by the third night they were almost fighting over who got the privilege of sleeping in the love seat.  Because the bed was just awful.

But it's Sam's night for the bed so he had slipped in and fell asleep fairly quickly, knowing from experience that Bucky would be up for a good while longer, not needed nearly as much sleep as mere humans like Sam and pretty adamant about keeping an eye out for securities sake as long as he possibly could.

It wasn't often that Sam still had nightmares anymore.  They were by no means unheard of but at least he's gotten to the point where he can recognize what's going on long before going into full blown panic mode.

That is, given a normal set of parameters of course.

His dream isn't anything spectacular.  He wouldn't even go as far as to classify it a nightmare really.  It's more a hodge-podge of bad memories that he's long since consciously dealt with and is just waiting for his sub conscious to catch up to the program.  But there are explosions and fights, a particularly nasty fall and the rapid beating of gun fire all around.  Something comes in contact with his face and Sam reacts one hundred percent on instinct, snatching whoever it is by the wrist and rolling under while tossing them over to the ground, following them down and pinning a well-built body down with his elbow trying to press against their throat.

The hand between his arm and his target is far more solid than it should be.

""Sam!  Hey!  Sam snap out of its just me.  It's Bucky.""

He blinks, trying to adjust his vision in the darkness while his heart beats furiously in his ears.  ""Buck?""  Sam doesn't move though he releases a tiny bit of pressure from his arm.  ""What the hell?""  His head is swimming, still trying to reconcile dream with reality and finally sits up, pressing his palms to his eyes a little harder than necessary.  As he slowly catches his breath there is a hand at his shoulder, gently squeezing and releasing in a careful, soothing motion.

""You alright?""

""Am I alight?  Jesus Bucky.  Why didn't you toss me off I -""

""Reacted as I would have.  I didn't want to hurt you and it was fairly easy to keep you from hurting me.  I shouldn't have - ""

""What are you doing up anyway?""  He drops his hands, barely listening to what Bucky is saying.  There is a look of concern in Bucky's eyes though, just barely visible in the dim light of the moon from outside their window.  They're both sitting now, Sam basically straddling Bucky's lap but he's still too wound far too tight to worry about that.

Bucky makes a frustrated noise, shaking Sam's shoulder once before his hand moves just a little higher, callused thumb running soothing lines down the side of Sam's neck.

Every stroke releases another thread of tension.

""I was out doing more recon.  Found something we need to check out.""

Sam tries to say something but he's cut off by a single raised finger.

""In the morning.""  Bucky finishes pointedly.  ""I'm sorry I woke you"" He adds, almost a whisper.

Though Sam huffs a laugh there is no humor in it.  There are fingers sliding along his scalp now.  He rolls his head back into the touch, groaning as his eyes flutter closed.  ""I'm gonna take the loveseat as compensation.""

""Fair enough.""  The words are quiet and warm, felt against the length of his neck as Sam feels himself drifting back, letting go and drowning in the comfort of the closeness.  But he can't stay here.  Can he?

He's almost forgotten why that is.

When Sam finally stands, drowsy and awkwardly shuffling away, he feels like he's forgetting something, leaving something unfinished or behind at the very least.  Just as he's falling back onto the loveseat he watches Bucky drop back as well, head and metal arm both landing on the ground with a loud sound of impact.

Sam yawns, curling up into optimum sleeping position for the small space.  ""Aren't you going to get back in the bed?""

""No.""

There's another heavy thud followed by a long suffering sigh.  ""I'm just gonna stay here forever.""

Though that seems peculiar, Sam's out again before he gives Bucky's strange behavior a second thought.

***

Bucky shows him what he found before breakfast - a small cabin hidden away in a copse of bushes and trees, impossible to find unless you're looking for it.

Or just awesome, apparently.

They decide they'll both check it out thoroughly at dusk, while most everyone is busy being social in the main hall but before it's too dark to really see anything.

It's another full day of horribly forced activities, made up excuses for bonding, and counselling sessions that should be intervened in by the American Psychological Association or something.

When the evening activity is announced, he wonders how these people get away with it.  It's called Confessions and apparently involves sitting back to back answering prompts and questions their ring masters throw out about their early years together.  It's supposed to bring back old memories and rekindle long lost feelings.  Reminding couples on the verge of hating each other why they used to get along seems like a horrible idea, especially given how much people can change in such a short span of time.  It seems to Sam that pointing out that they fell in love with a sense of humor that has long been snuffed out by years of internal struggle and heartache would kind of have the opposite effect of what they're going for here.

But he doesn't say anything.

Because Thomas Buchanan is a dentist.

A few of the couples tear up.  Some just look like they're three hundred percent done with this whole farce.  Which is pretty close to how Sam feels.

Bucky though, Bucky looks oddly determined.  He's got that tight lipped, straight forward stare he gets just before he goes into battle.  Sam gives him a wary smile and the look just grows more intense.

When they're called up to the little podium he says something to Mr. Perky Councilor Number 13 who shakes his head.  ""Sorry James.  Everyone else has done it, you can too.""

Though Sam doesn't see the look Bucky gives the guy, he can imagine its terrifying.  Especially since not five seconds later he's singing a completely different tune.  ""Well, I suppose we could, make an exception?  If it means you promise to be completely honest and cooperative.""

Ten minutes later, confused and frowning at Bucky who is giving literally nothing away, Sam finds himself sitting in a quiet room with just his friend and one of the less annoying councilors.  No audience like the others had had.  She's a lot less... intense... than any of the others and even though she still toes the party line, Lauren is incredibly forgiving.

She gets them set up like everyone else had been - back to back on a bench and goes through some trite promises not to interrupt or say anything while the other is talking.  Then they get started.

""Alright Thomas.  We're going to start with something simple.  Tell us the first though you had when you met James.  What was going through your head?""

Sam blinks.

Talk about a loaded fucking question.

For a long time he considers the question and eventually decides, to hell with it.  He promised to be honest.

""I am so fucked."" He says flatly.

Lauren's face flashes in confusion for the briefest of moments but otherwise remains the stoic expression of neutrality.

""Just that?""

""Oh there were quite a few more choice words but I don't think they're appropriate at the moment.""

""Right.  Well, James.  Your turn.  What is one thing that you learned early on about Thomas that you really...""  She takes a deep breath and makes an exaggerated gesture.  ""...appreciated about him?""

Sam feels Bucky shake when he nearly snorts.  ""It's really hard to keep him down for very long.""  He can't help the smile that cracks across his face and he shakes his head.

""So, he's got a good outlook on life then?""

""Yeah sure.  That too.""

She marks something down in her notebook and turns to Sam again.  ""How does James like his coffee?""

""That's a stupid question.""  He frowns at her,  ""I know how all of my friends like their coffee because I'm not a self-absorbed ass and I pay attention.""

Bucky coughs.  ""Anthony.""

""Gentlemen.  Focus, please.  Thomas it's a simple question with a simple answer.""

""Yeah.  And pointless.  It's got absolutely nothing to do with anything.""

""You're deflecting.""

With a smug grin he finally states.   ""He likes it Black and Bitter.""  Which is totally true, hilarious for the present situations or not.

Bucky laughs again, nearly folding in half with the force of it.

""James.  How well do you think Thomas handles conflict?""  Ok that feels like it's a pointed question and Sam can't help but feeling a little offended for more than one reason.

""Why does he get the complicated ones?""  She gives him an exasperated look but doesn't say anything.

""Like a well-trained and highly disciplined soldier.""  Bucky answers as if Sam hadn't interrupted.

""Oh?  Can you explain?""

""He sees a problem, makes a judgment call, and just... you could say he just flies right in.""

It's Sam's turn to laugh.

""Do you appreciate that about him?""

""Oh it's hot as hell.""

Lauren looks like she's going to write something else down but stops, tapping her pen against her pad for a beat before finally looking up again with a sigh.  ""Alright, Thomas.""  She sounds terribly put-upon.  ""You wanted a complicated one?  How does - or did in the beginning if you feel like he doesn't now - James express his love for you?  What is it that made you know, without question, that he felt the same way?""

Well.  Shit.  Sam blinks at her for a long time.  That kind of throws him, because he doesn't have an honest yet bullshit answer for her.  He's never thought Bucky felt the same way and even if he had dared to hope, like hell he was going to know how to spin it into something ridiculous.   

""Thomas?""

""I don't know.""  He eventually gets out, quiet and looking down at his knees.  ""I question every day whether or not he feels the same way I do.""  Lauren jots something down while looking towards Bucky.  Sam REALLY wishes he could see him right that second.

""Hm.  Okay.  We're going to skip a few questions in that case.  James, can you tell me how you fell in love with your husband?""

There's silence for a long span of time.  They'd been kidding around with her and each other for the most part but Sam feels like he had tilted everything in an odd direction.

""Go on, James.""

""I...  I don't really know where to begin.  I mean, when we first met I hated him.""  Understatement.  ""Well, I thought I did anyway.  It's what I was supposed to do, what I was taught.  And then the second time we met I didn't really... remember him?  But, he knows as well as I do how screwed up my life was then.  But somehow that didn't matter to S- to Thomas.""  Bucky stops and Sam thinks he might be done, but apparently he's just gathering his thoughts.  ""He didn't see me like almost everyone else did, he and, well, my best friend.  The two of them saw in me what I couldn't even see in myself.  Still have trouble seeing to be honest.  And while both of them were there for me, Sam... you didn't have any expectations ya know?""  He can feel Bucky shift behind him, like he's trying to turn around so they can face each other.  Sam's chest feels like its in a vice.  ""It was like while everything kept pushing me in every direction you just opened up and said 'I'm here if you need me' and you were, not pushing or pulling or ever asking anything of me.  You always were there too.  No matter how messy or ugly it got, whenever I fell it was next to you.  And you didn't just pick me back up, you let me figure it out on my own.  You showed me how it was done and let me pick myself up.  I'll never be the man I was way back when, and God help me never be the one you first met, but, when I'm who I am now next to you, it seems like that'll be enough.""

""Buck - ""

""Ah ah ah Thomas.  It's not your turn.  Let James finish.""

""No.  I think I'm done.""

She asks more questions after that, though Sam immediately starts his next answer off with a lie that Bucky will know without a doubt is false so he will understand that everything from that point on is just as bogus.  It's hard to focus at that point, as he knows if he tries to veer off topic Lauren will just beat them back into place.  He can't really think straight and his chest still feels heavy.

He's going to murder Steve.

 

***

""You have got to be kidding me.""

Sam kicks the leg of the completely fucking empty desk in frustration.

As soon as their confession session had ended their window for investigating the cabin Bucky had found was already half over.  So they had put their fake relationship issues aside for later to focus on the matter at hand.  It was difficult, Bucky's words running constantly through the back of his head - but they had a job to do.

Turns out though, it may have all been for nothing.

The little building is mostly empty, with only a filing cabinet, large wooden desk and waist high bookshelf - all empty.

""I'm starting to think the only evil thing going on here is horrible relationship advice.""  Bucky's leaning back against the desk with his arms folded over his chest and one foot hooked around the other ankle.

Determined for their venture to have actually had a point to it, Sam drops to the ground and starts scanning the base boards and floor for some kind of secret hatch.  He makes the perimeter of the room before looking back over his shoulder.  ""You gonna help or just stand there and look pretty?""

Bucky, who has been blatantly staring the entire time, smirks.  ""No no.  You have this handled.  Please..."" he gestures around the room.  ""Continue.""

Before Sam can make a retort the sound of movement outside snatches both of their attention.  He's on his feet in an instant and Bucky's entire stance changes to rigid fight mode, shoulders tense, eyes alert and left arm forward.  He also no so subtly puts himself between Sam and the door.

""We've got to get out of here.""

""Can't.""  Bucky ducks toward the window to try and spot their intruder.  He speaks quietly.  ""Everything but the front door is sealed shut and they're coming straight this way.""

""And what would you propose we do instead?""

""What the hell do you THINK a married couple trying to rekindle the flames would be doing in an abandoned cabin in the woods?""

""At this place?""  Sam snaps back.  ""Killing each other most likely.""

Bucky looks momentarily like Sam has lost his damn mind.  But then that familiar look of determination takes over in the crease of his brow and the set of his jaw.  ""Aw, Fuck it.""  He mutters, grabbing Sam by the front of his shirt and tugging him forward into a harsh and bruising kiss.

Startled as he may be, Sam is immediately with the program.

Even though no one ever comes, neither of them bother to notice.

He gets a firm grip into Bucky's hair and surges up to meet him the rest of the way, parting his lips to deepen the kiss as their bodies melt against one another.  Warmth pools in his gut and he's kissed senseless, fingers dragging down along the lines of his back.  Before he's even aware they were moving he bumps against the desk.  Sam doesn't pull away, just jumps up to sit on the surface with the help of Bucky's hand that's already gripping his ass.  All along his body his skin feels alive with energy, surging hotter with every move of Bucky's lips against his own.

Its Bucky who breaks away first, though only to shift his focus from Sam's lips to his jaw and neck.  ""You...""  He starts between drags of his lips.  ""Are the most infuriating man... I have ever met.""

Sam tilts his head to the side silently begging for more and shaking with the sensations pouring down his spine like warm water.  ""Don't know what you're on about.""  He parts his knees and lets Bucky drag him forward, their hips meeting as Sam locks his ankles around Bucky.  Even with the layers of denim between them he can feel the hard bulge of Bucky's cock rubbing against his own.  It stutters his breath and spurs his heart rate into over drive.  Hands and lips go everywhere, under shirts, along long lines of muscle, fingers scraping against scalps and down the ridges of each others spines. They're lost to it, to each other.  Sam so wrapped up in what he's ached for for so damn long that he can't even remember any of his excuses.

He wants to tell him, confess how much he's wanted him.

But it's Bucky who steals his words right out from under his feet.

""Do you know...""  He speaks quietly, lips barely brushing against Sam's ear and breath hot on his skin.  ""How long I've wanted this?  Wanted you?""

He can't help it.  Sam laughs.  Luckily Bucky doesn't seem offended though, especially as he starts working the button and zipper of Sam's jeans.  ""You have no idea.""  Slowly his laughter dies down into small and catching gasps for air harder and harder to catch the more Bucky teases and touches him everywhere.  ""Why didn't you say anything?""

""You're one to talk.""  Bucky answers a little flatly.

""Touche.""

Sam is so ready for this, all of this, but there's still one thing that's not quite right.  He grabs Bucky's left hand, faux flesh glove still in place like it always is when they're around the rest of the camp.  Bucky watches him carefully and seems to hold his breath.  ""This though.  This has got to go.""  The glove comes off with a couple of tugs and he tosses it to the side, barely catching Bucky's grin before he's nearly knocked backwards with the force of his kiss.  Sam never wants this to fucking end, the feel of Bucky's body against him, the way he tastes, the sounds he makes when Sam touches him, the jolts of pleasure that overtake Sam when it's the other way around.  They're moving so fast and so desperate for each other, so perfectly in synch that he almost forgets.

Almost.

""Buck...""  This can't be all he gets, all he can have.  ""Tell me this is more than just - "" he stops himself, worried about putting it all out there because if this was it, it would never be enough.  ""More than just - "" He's silenced with another kiss, far from the harshness of before and yet so much more in the gentle way Bucky comforts him with it and cradles his head.

""This is everything, Sam.""

And yeah, okay, Sam's got a heart of mush and it's just getting worse.  He's a tough guy but even hardened soldiers need a safe place to crash.  ""Good.  Good, I'm... good.""  

The smile on his face doesn't go away for a long time.

For someone who - all things considered - only recently started willingly conversing with people again, Bucky talks a lot.  He says a mixture of the sweetest and filthiest things to Sam, everything he's thought of and fantasized about, what he wants what he thinks Sam will like.  Sam drinks it up.  Every word goes straight to his dick, so much so that by the time they're both free, Bucky's hand wrapped around their lengths and sliding together, he's having a hell of a time holding on to his control.

He slips his own hand between them to entwine with Bucky's while his other is fisted in lengths of dark hair, guiding his head back so Sam can take his turn sucking and biting marks into the long lines of Bucky's neck.  With the added attention and the energy boiling between the, Bucky's words are reduced to desperate curses and quiet groans of pleasure.

""Sam - Sam I'm, Fuck!""

Sam leans back just enough to watch Bucky's face as he comes, pinched and abandoned, completely lost to the world.  He spills hot and wet between them, rhythm failing with every pulse of his release and it's the sexiest damn thing Sam has ever seen.  He's right there on the edge with him, ready to follow Bucky over when he stops completely, dropping his head against Sam's shoulder to catch his breath.

But Sam doesn't have a chance to ask if he's okay, to kiss him or say anything at all.  Because between one breath and the next Bucky sinks down to his knees and takes him in his mouth, to the hilt, in a quick and fluid motion.  Breath caught in his chest, Sam watches as his cock slips in and out of red, kiss swollen lips once, twice, and he is gone.

It's like a cord deep in him snaps, releasing all the tension Bucky has been building up in Sam's body all at once.  He thinks he curses, probably repeats Bucky's name over and over until he is begging him to stop while somehow still hoping he never does.  When Bucky finally does release him he's got a satisfied smile and seems to be savoring something before swallowing heavily.

""Fucking hell Bucky.""

He licks a thick, wet stripe up Sam's abs, catching some of his own release in the process before surging up for another kiss.  The taste of them both on Bucky's tongue is heady and Sam moans into the slow and languid kiss.

""So.  Everything you said?""  Once he can think straight again Sam hooks his arm around Bucky's neck and holds him close, foreheads pressed together, occasionally stealing more kisses.

""God's honest truth, Sam.  I just couldn't figure out how to tell you.""

He almost feels like he's dreaming.  ""I thought it was just me.  That I was - I don't know, that if I had said anything it wouldn't be what you wanted or were ready for - I'm an idiot.""

Bucky's laugh is quiet and kind.  ""No.  No, Sam.  You're just a good man.  I don't des-""

""Ah ah ah.""  Sam presses his fingers to Bucky's lips and looks at him in earnest.  ""Stop that right here, right now.  Bucky Barnes you have been through absolute hell and if anyone deserves some kind of good in their lives it's you.""   He presses another kiss against Bucky's tight pressed lips, feeling the tremble he's trying to hold back.  ""I'd like to be that for you as long as you'll let me.""

For a moment Bucky is silent, slowly taking in a deep breath.  When he nods Sam's chest feels infinitely lighter.

They lose track of time holding and kissing each other, Sam eventually leaning back to stretch, Bucky holding him while watching with a hungry stare.  He reaches back, holding on to the back edge of the desk to brace himself when something like a switch gives beneath his fingers and the floor immediately lurches and rumbles.

""Uh.""

""Fuck.""  Sam bolts up, looking around the room as it starts to sink.

""I've heard the saying about earth moving sex before but I didn't think it was literal.""  Sam gives Bucky a flat stare and he adds, ""Or this delayed.""

The walls around them seem to slowly rise up as they're lowered in to the ground, sliding slowly down until the windows above are no longer letting in enough light to see by.

""We'll finish this conversation after?""  Bucky asks while pulling his pants back into place.

""Yup.  But now it's time to go to work.""

***

""Wait wait wait.  Stop.  Go back a second.  Why did you have your shirt off?""

Sam blinks.

He stutters.  ""W- When did I say that?""

Steve grins like he knows something he shouldn't.  Probably because outside of high adrenaline situations Sam has a terrible poker face.  ""You didn't.  But you did say you used it to steal some one's gun, which to me implies it was no longer on your body.""

""Ok.  But that is completely beside the point.""  Sam deflects.  ""The point is, the reason they were shitty relationship councilors was because they weren't trying to fix marriages.  They were testing for people who would be a good fit for their ""Noah"" program for repopulating the Earth - susceptible to certain types of influences and in just bad enough of a marriage that they either wouldn't be missed when they were taken or the first assumption would be that they split of their own volition.  They were TRYING to make some of those relationships worse.""  Luckily Sam and Bucky had taken down the entire operation after only a few people had been kidnapped.  Their plans had apparently called for a final number of over a hundred - who knows how long it would have been going on.  Getting the bad guys monologuing about their plans for world destruction and eventual repopulation had been laughably easy.

""Huh.""  Steve downs the rest of his juice then sets the glass down on the bar counter with a soft laugh.

""What?""

""Nothing.  Well.  It's just I didn't expect there to actually be anything shady going on, is all.""

For a moment Sam's confused.  It had been Steve who insisted on an investigation in the first place.

His mouth falls open in shock though the moment the other shoe drops.

""You have got to be shitting me.  Does Bucky know you're a no good, lying, busy-body?""

Sam could smack that smug smirk right off Steve's face.  ""One.  I never lied.  Two.  Yes.  He's perfectly aware of that fact.""  He shrugs.  ""Just not this particular instance of it.  I'd like to keep breathing for a few more years.""

The glare Sam gives him is half disbelief and half smug superiority because he could SO tell on him.

Apparently Steve figures that out.

""You wouldn't.""

""Oh I so would.""

Even though he tries to look dead serious, Sam cracks a smile far too soon.  ""You're getting off easy this time, Rogers.  Of course, I'm either gonna kill you myself or throw you a damn parade.  Jury's still out.""

Steve's laugh is bright and easy.  ""Tell you what - why don't we call it even and you just promise not to break my best friend's heart.""

Sam gives him a flat look.  ""On what planet is that even?""

""Well.  I guess if you want to get technical about it it's not.  But I'm fairly certain you're getting the best part of this whole thing.""

Just then both of them have their attention drawn to the entry of the kitchen where Bucky shuffles in, bleary eyed and grumbling, sweats barely clinging to his hips and hair an absolute mess.  As he moves through the kitchen to get his coffee they both get a full view of his chest and back.  The scratches are somewhat faded but the bite marks on his neck and chest and finger bruises on his hips will be around for at least the rest of the day.  Sam can't even find it in himself to blush but rather feels kind of proud.  Especially since he's three hundred percent certain Bucky's only forgone a shirt specifically to show off.

""Yeah.  Yeah I really am.""

He doesn't see Steve's reaction, too busy catching the way Bucky's glancing at him sideways with a tiny smile of his own.  As soon as he has his coffee in hand Bucky turns and leans back, half against the counter half against Sam who can immediately feel the cold radiating from the metal of his arm.  Instead of moving away from it, without even thinking, he starts rubbing the cool skin where flesh meets metal with an open palm.  For a few quiet moments Bucky leans into the touch, neither seemingly aware they still have an audience.  But eventually, Bucky takes a deep breath.

""Hey, Steve?""

Steve doesn't even look bothered.  ""Yeah?""

""Thanks.""

He looks as surprised as Sam feels for a half a second before the look of shock quietly shifts to a fond and warm smile.

""Anytime, Buck.  Anytime.""

Dr. Hart's office is nice.

Maybe a bit too sterile (but what can you expect with all its governmental brutalist interior design? And Christ, this waiting room sofa is not comfortable -- despite that fact, it has become your own designated spot) but there is this little bonsai tree in the corner by the door that you like. A lot.

When you'd asked about it, Dr. Hart said her father had been given it as a gift after his service in the second world war and she'd tended to it since his passing a decade ago.

""It's going on ninety-two years,"" she shrugged, ""It takes patience and some nurturing and a lot of learning, but I've kept it alive all this time... Some might say it's a good allegory for therapy.""

She said it with a hint of sardonic humor. You laughed at that. ""Plants are nice.""

""I thought you'd say that,"" she clucked, ""Is it because they're predictable? No what-if's or challenges there? Nothing like people.""

The jab was good-natured, but with a pointed edge; and back then, you didn't know any better than to lie and try to hide the fact she'd just read you like a book she knew all too well. Dog-eared corners and all. You'd lied to her face, said some stupid bold faced lie. It was about liking surprises. It was an attempt to divert the conversation. To control it.

You hate surprises.

Stupid.

She knew better. And now that you've been seeing her for four months, you could argue she knew you better than anyone else in your life. Maybe that isn't saying much -- mostly since the three biggest people in your life happened to be Dr. Hart, your neighbor Miss Bonnie, and your cat Mister Poke Bowl.

... Dr. Hart kept saying Poke didn't count, but it felt just plain rude to discredit the calico's clear, innate gift of listening. He was good at that. He always knew when you were having one of those moments. And, you two hung out, like, all the time. He definitely counted as a person. Or, maybe half of one.

For sure.

The door to the waiting room opens slowly, and your view of the bonsai tree disappears for a second. Suddenly, in its wake stands a tall, broad-shouldered man with a tired look. You blink. Your knee, for a moment, halts the rhythmic temp it had been locked into. Up and down and up and... down and up.

You've never seen him before.

He must be one of Dr. Raynor's patients. You'd met her a handful of times in passing. She shared an office space with Dr. Hart -- the two ran a practice together in downtown Manhattan. You knew that Dr. Raynor worked with the VA, mostly military-related clientele. Usually, it was uniform-clad servicemen that found a seat next to you in the office, wringing their berets in clammy hands. You wish you could say you didn't mind; they were all nice enough. It was just...

People. People are hard.

This man didn't need a uniform for you to know he was a soldier.

The way he carries himself to talk to Paula, the lovely secretary behind the front desk, tells you all you need to know. It's the cadence of his steps, the weight of his gait. He walks with purpose, but his expression says otherwise -- almost as if he's ashamed he takes up so much space in this quiet, little office.

You shift in your seat. Your knee resumes its bounce.

You find yourself staring; he looks horribly uncomfortable when he turns around to find a seat, and suddenly you find yourself wishing you could extend some sort of comfort. But, the thought of opening your mouth and speaking to the stranger is wildly paralyzing.

He finds a spot diagonal to you in that emerald chair that creaks, beside the bonsai.

When Dr. Hart rounds the corner and calls your name a second later, you disappear into her office without a second glance.                                

 

It's him again.

You're in the waiting room, fifteen minutes early like always.

He comes in two minutes after you and takes up the same spot as last time. Right by the bonsai. That emerald chair creaks as he sits with his legs spread and elbows resting on his knees. His head is bowed. He looks, frankly, like he could throw-up without a moment's notice.

Again, the temptation to offer some sort of comfort bubbles up.


Like, what? 'It gets easier?' Sure. We've all heard that line.


You swallow it down and sigh.

The quiet makes your ears ring. You don't like this feeling of forced silence. Sometimes it's even worse than conversation. It feels like picking the better of two evils. Dr. Hart says that's a normal feeling. That sometimes we just don't have enough in us to carry on a conversation; that recharging and listening is completely normal. She'd made a point to state that didn't mean avoiding human interaction all together for the sake of comfort.


""You need to learn how to live again. It's going to look different from last time, but you don't need to be anchored and drowned by your fear.""


You cross your legs and weave your arms together and chew the inside of your lip.

When the stranger finally raises his head and leans back, you can't help the way your eyes jump to his face. You feel like you've had a brick hurled at your skull when you realize he's looking back at you with these big, tired, blue eyes. There's a tense moment of pained realization that you'd both been caught looking; then he clears his throat and crosses his own arms. He rubs a gloved hand over his face.

His eyes find the door.

To you, the bonsai tree has now become tenfold more interesting.

But, in that millisecond, you'd had enough time to realize he's handsome.

The next week, he's there before you.

In your seat.

Your seat.

The one in the center of the far wall, the one where you can see both exits from. The one that has a good view of the hall where the other offices are, and the bonsai. That pale green couch isn't comfortable in the fucking slightest but it does, somehow, bring you comfort. Routine. Structure.

You stutter-step when you push through the entrance to the office, half stuck on the rising panic of unplanned change, and half grimacing at the horrible realization you can't ask him to move. That would be rude. Incredibly rude. He definitely wouldn't. You wouldn't want him to either. He looks... less like he's going to yack. More calm.

You worry the sleeve of your sweater when you greet Paula. She gives you a sympathetic look, leaning to eye the man behind you when she checks you in. The artificial blonde leans, bending to reach under her desk.

""Twizzler for your trouble?"" she whispers, tossing you a wink.

You smile, really smile, as you take one.


""Thank you.""


You turn around and it takes you a second to evaluate your options.

Bucky notices.

He immediately felt bad when you'd pushed open the door. He hadn't expected you to be here again, but he supposes that's how this therapy thing works, huh? Routine. Structure. He wasn't going to tell Dr. Raynor (didn't want it to go to her head), but this whole thing is helping. A little bit. He felt like he was in control of one thing, at least, and that was where he was going to be every Tuesday at 9am.

He also notices that you're pretty. You've got big, tired doe-eyes. You hold yourself like you're fragile.

He almost gets up when you linger a second longer, a look of panic swelling in your eyes -- but you move to sit where he did last time before he can stand. Your attention is immediately on the bonsai tree. An approving look comes across your face when you notice it's been trimmed recently.

Bucky's eyes move to the wrapper that begins to crinkle in your hands.

On the good days, he remembers most things. Like his mom, his sister, his old house. He remembers boxing, his first Championship Title win, and where he used to go dancing with Steve. It took a long time, and a lot of journals full of feverish scribbles, but he remembered. Now, he isn't afraid of forgetting like he was. But, recently there have been little details that flick him in the forehead and leave him staring into space, dumbfounded at the simplest things like the senile old man he really is.

He's having one of those very moments.

The licorice in your hand. It's red. Strawberry flavored? No. Cherry? Could be. It's twisty.

He watches you take a bite.

All of a sudden, he blurts it out.


""Red vines.""


Your head snaps to him, eyes wide. The Twizzler is hanging out of your mouth. You choke a bit.

""...I'm sorry?""

Bucky's mouth falls open and his brows lift in quiet realization he'd all but shouted the name of the candy he used to waddle down to the general store on fifth street with a penny for.

God, he loved those fuckin' things. Used to tear them apart to make 'em last longer.

His mouth hangs open for a second and he blinks once, twice, three times at you. You're like a deer in headlights, gripping half the licorice in your hand and the other half dangling from your lips. It'd been a good bite. He almost laughs at how terrified you look -- but instead, he shakes his head and pulls the corners of his mouth downwards in a ""don't worry about it"" expression.

""I, uh,"" he waves a hand in an attempt to move on. His voice is quiet. Almost a mumble, ""I haven't had one of those in, like, a hundred years. Give or take.""

Suddenly, Dr. Raynor is in the doorway.

Bucky meets her gaze, and then he's gone.

And you're left to look over your shoulder, wide-eyed as he disappears down the hall, with half the Twizzler still hanging out of your mouth.

He isn't there the following week.

You sit in your usual spot and stare at the ninety-two-year-old bonsai.

""Have you been doing your ABC sheets?""

You're chewing the inside of your lip when Dr. Hart asks. You suppose she knows the answer before you even speak judging by the pointed look she's pinned you in your chair with. You cross your legs tightly, fingers busy drawing patterns in the pale grey suede of the armchair. Your frown is self-deprecating.

""I didn't think my ABCs applied to this.""

""Those sheets are going to apply to most things, you know,"" she raises a brow, ""Like last week. Remember? When someone took your seat in the waiting room. There's a stuck point in there.""

""It's just a seat.""

""But to you,"" Dr. Hart clicks her pen, ""It's more than that, isn't it?""

Your leg is bouncing again. Up and down. Up and down. She clicks her pen again and you draw a tight circle in the suede over and over. There's a tight silence that feels physical. The sort to make your chest tight. Words aren't easy, now.

You wince.

You speak slowly.

""I like to do what I do. What I always do.""

""So it's about being in control?"" Dr. Hart suggests gently.

You pout. Immediately ducking your head to your hands, you nod. She's right. You two have been over this. It's the social anxiety and the trust issues and the little flickers of bad that creep up when you start to feel the world spin just a little too fast around you.

""...Guess I shoulda done my worksheets.""

""No shit,"" Dr. Hart clicks her pen one final time and then sits forward. She's smiling in a motherly sort of way. The kind of way you missed all those years your mom was gone. It settles you down. She turns in her chair, facing her large birchwood desk that has a bamboo plant on the highest shelf. Placing her notepad down, Dr. Hart claps her hands together, ""I'm giving you homework this week. Do your worksheets...""

She trails off, jotting down a note.

""And?"" you quirk your head, looking mildly pained.

""And, I want you to talk to the person who took your seat. Who knows. Maybe you'll make a friend.""

Before you can argue against it, that you already have friends, Dr. Hart raises a finger. She shushes you and stands. She gestures to the door.

After all, your time is up.

You've decided that, in order to curb the seat-stealing, you'll simply get to your appointment twenty minutes early from now on.

The rented space that operates as Dr. Hart and Dr. Raynor's joint office is on the sixth floor. The building itself is massive -- all glass windows lining the street, plenty of natural light. Even a security desk up front. Very modern. Still brutalist and sharp, but nice. It was almost always busy.

And, it seems like your seat stealing stranger had the same idea as you today.

He's early.

You notice someone looming over your shoulder the moment you press the elevator's up button. The glossy little plate goes red. You frown to yourself.

You have to remember to breathe when the elevator quickly becomes full. You're shouldered to the back corner -- and you're twiddling your fingers in circles on your palm as you breathe in and hold and let go. With each floor, the elevator grows emptier and with each floor it gets easier to breathe.

Finally, after a minute that feels like an hour, it's only you and the sofa poacher in the lift.

You can feel his eyes on you. When you turn to look, you can't help but notice he's fast to avert his eyes. He rocks on the heels of his black, steel-toed boots. He clears his throat. There's a second of tense silence.

Then, he leans over and without looking at you, offers:

""Sorry I took your seat.""

You blink up at him. There's this pained smile on his face as he says it -- one that seems almost embarrassed. He's looking at you now, eyes roaming your guarded reaction.

""It's, uh, it's the only spot in the waiting room where you can see all the exits,"" he says slowly, ""I get a little paranoid. Dr. Raynor said I probably owed you an apology. Told me I'd forgotten my manners.""

You relax a little.

""I was considering pressing charges, y'know. It's a pretty egregious crime..."" comes the easy reply. It shocks you. When's the last time you cracked a joke with someone? Before the Snap, maybe. Your previous malice and anxiety begin to melt from your posture when he snorts quietly, ""But, it's not like my name's written on it. So thanks.""

""Yeah,"" he breathes as the doors to the elevator open, ""Yeah, it's no problem.""

You move as the doors swing open. He holds a hand, high above your head, to keep the doors from closing. He's quick to open the door to the office for you. Suddenly, you feel bad for being so... irritated. He clearly was just trying to make himself more comfortable in a new setting. Rationally speaking, you understood completely.

You check-in with Paula and when you meander on towards your usual spot, you sit far to the left of the sofa. You lean up against the arm and watch as the man turns to look for a seat.

Bucky is surprised to find that you're inclining your head towards the now free spot beside you.

The smile that creeps into his cheeks is quick and small but very real.

The next week, he gets there early and makes sure to leave room for you on the sofa.

He tries not to act like he was waiting for you when you enter the office; you toss him a small wave before moving to check-in with Paula. She must have noticed the exhausted look on your face -- all thanks to the way your week had been while dealing with the trauma narrative Dr. Hart had assigned for homework -- and offers up some Twizzlers again.

You make a point of taking two.

When you sit down, the man beside you offers a closed-lip smile.

You offer the Twizzler.

He pauses, eyes lighting up a bit. It's subtle enough, but you notice the micro-twitch of his brows almost immediately.

You're already biting into yours when you speak. ""What did you call these?""

""Red Vines,"" Bucky blinks, fingers stilling as he nods. His words are slow and he speaks with a profound sense of finality that's incredibly comedic, ""And I called them that because that's what they are.""

""They're Twizzlers,"" you chew, eyeing the licorice in your hand, ""Red Vines sound like something that would give me a rash.""

""Yeah, well, Twizzler sounds stupid,"" he supplies, taking his own bite, ""...Twizzler. Who even came up with that?""

That gets a snort out of you. Quiet. Barely there. But it's a laugh.

You flick your wrapper at him when Dr. Hart calls your name. Bucky smiles to himself as you disappear around the corner.

""Nice brick.""

Bucky jumps.

He'd been preoccupied with the cellphone in his hands.

Dr. Raynor had suggested he get one. To keep in contact with friends, she'd said. But, Bucky couldn't even figure out how to send a 'text' on this thing. He didn't know what any of this meant -- and even still, this one had buttons. Nothing like that weird touchscreen shit he saw at the local mobile store.

He blinks. He hadn't even heard you sit down next to him in the waiting room.

""What?""

""That,"" you point, finger waggling, ""The phone. It's a brick. Could probably survive a nuclear blast. Kinda like a cockroach, y'know?""

""That's a nice feature,"" he mumbles, ""Did I pay extra for that?""

""No,"" you laugh a little, ""It's built-in with those Nokias.""

His brows raise quickly, and he folds the phone over in his gloved hands.

""Do, uh... Do you know how to type on this thing? Y'know, how to send a 'text'?""

Your lashes flutter. There's confusion swirling in your eyes. Bucky can see it -- and it makes him feel sheepish for even asking. But, you nod and gesture with a gimme motion. He hands over the flip phone. Intrigued, he watches as you effortlessly pull up the inbox and start a new message.

""The numbers,"" you explain, ""Are letters. So, uh, 'hi' is just the four button twice, then three times.""

His face is stoic. He speaks evenly. ""What the fuck.""

""Listen, you bought this ancient relic, not me,"" you wave a hand in the air dismissively, ""I'm surprised you didn't invest in a little charm for this thing.""

""And you, uh, you text the same way?""

""No way, grandpa,"" you mutter, confused about his naivete when it came to the technology -- but again, who were you to judge. You reach into your back pocket and muscle your own phone out. The thing is light and sleek compared to the blunt force weapon in Bucky's hand, ""It's a touchscreen.""

""Too complicated.""

""Says the man literally wearing out his three key already.""

You aren't at your appointment the next week.

Bucky just stares at the old bonsai tree and worries.

You're in the coffee shop down the street from Dr. Hart's office, thirty minutes before your appointment, when someone taps you on the shoulder.

It's a little place, in the basement of a retail shop. It's usually quiet. You don't worry as much as usual about the crowding -- not like what happens at Starbucks. That sort of shit is painfully anxiety-inducing. Too many eyes. Too many ways to fuck up.

You can't help but laugh when you turn around to see the stranger from the waiting room. Suddenly, you're not tapping your foot. You're not as anxious as before.

You both speak at the same time.

""You missed your appointment last week.""

""Are you stalking me?""

Bucky snorts. Your face is lit up -- a rare look of genuine contentment settling in the weight of your lips. He steps up next to you by the end of the counter, apparently waiting for an order just like you. His hands are in his pockets.

""If I was stalking you,"" he says, pursing his lips and watching the barista, ""You wouldn't know until it's too late.""

""Ooh,"" you coo, eyes wandering the menu you'd already ordered from, ""Big words coming from the technologically inept one. Speaking of, how's the texting going? Finally spell out a word?""

""Can't say I really have anyone I text.""

You look up at him then. ""No one?""

""No one.""

You hum. Before you can reply, the barista calls your name and slides your order across the counter. It's a hot tea with honey -- not what you'd usually opt for, but Dr. Hart had been rather adamant about cutting back on the caffeine intake. It was a blow, but one that had quickly settled a lot of your wilder panic attacks.

When you return to the stranger's side, his voice is soft.

""So that's your name.""

You snort a hot burst of air through your nose. You duck your head.

""It fits, y'know,"" he nudges you gently with his elbow, ""Definitely fits.""

Then, the barista calls out a tall cold brew for Becky.

The man beside you sighs.

Your brows raise. He moves, retrieving the order. He shoots you a look -- one that's borderline murderous.

""Becky?"" you ask, falling in step with him, ""No judgment--""

""Don't say it--""

""--It fits?"" you take a sly sip of your tea.

The morning air is cold. Becky holds the door for you. He's got the gloves on, still. Even though it's forty-five out and the sun is bright. But, like a lot of things with this man, you opt not to ask.

""It's Bucky, actually,"" he makes a point to enunciate his letters, ""And that happens more often than I'd like to admit.""

""Hm. Bucky,"" you say, testing it on your tongue.

""That's my name. Don't wear it out.""

You nod, turning mid-step to offer your hand.

He shakes it.

""Nice to meet you, Bucky.""

His laugh is warm -- the sort that feels like a rare little glimpse of someone he used to be. Somehow, it almost seems foreign to him. You catch that look in his eyes, but continue to try and match his longer strides. His legs are long.

""Does this make us friends?"" he asks, suddenly.

""I dunno,"" you mutter with a hopeful look, ""Does it?""

""I think I'd like to be friends,"" he nods, sipping the cold brew as the two of you come to rest at a crosswalk, ""You are sort of funny. Good with technology, too. You could be useful to keep around.""

You're rolling your eyes before you can stop yourself.

""Well, Dr. Hart keeps telling me that my cat doesn't count as a friend, so seems like I'm also in the market for some. Lucky you.""

""Lucky me,"" Bucky waves at a car that stops, letting them cross, with the practiced ease of someone born and raised in this city, ""Cat?""

He's smiling into his drink when you perk up and yank your phone out before slipping past him when he holds the door to the lobby open for you.

""His legal name is Mister Poke Bowl, but you can call him Poke,"" you explain, lighting up the screen with a rather nice photo of a calico sunbathing and passing it his way, ""So, yeah. Cat.""

""... I like cats.""

""Well, we're friends. So you'll have to meet him sometime.""

You're both smiling when you enter the elevator, fifteen minutes early for your appointments. 

Bucky should probably tell you about the arm. Friends don't lie to friends, right?

""So you'd consider her a friend.""

""...Is that a question, doc?""

""More of a conclusion,"" Dr. Raynor says, thumbing her pen as she crosses her legs and lets out a long exhale. She's watching him -- watching him like he watches other people. It makes Bucky itch. She continues, ""One that's a bit surprising, if I'm being completely honest.""

""What's so surprising about that?"" Bucky retorts, hands clasped in front of him as he bounces his knee. His tone is dry. His eyes are tired.

""Let's be honest, James, you're shit at maintaining interpersonal relationships,"" Dr. Raynor leans forward, ""You're aloof, bitter, and at times, ridiculously cold. You've got a track record of going off the grid and a big shadow that you walk in.""

""Gee, thanks--""

""--I'm not done,"" she says flippantly, raising a finger, ""I was going to say, despite all that, you've made a friend. Someone who you connect with. And that's a big step in the right direction, James.""

Bucky is quiet. His eyes find the carpet and he traces the pattern. He does that when he thinks. When his brain decides to settle on the topic at hand -- a rare little moment of focus. Of acceptance. Because Raynor is right. Despite how much he hates it -- how much he hates that he isn't the man he used to be -- she knows him. She knows what makes him tick.

""You're going to have to tell her, you know.""

He flinches.

She continues. ""Because if you don't, she's going to never really know you. As much as you're not the man you used to be, that's still a part of your personal past. And c'mon, James, how long can you really go wearing that leather jacket? And the gloves? You look like a mob fixer.""

""They're comfortable--""

""It's 65 degrees and sunny out--""

""Won't get a sunburn--""

""Try heatstroke.""

There's quiet. Bucky bites the inside of his lip. Dr. Raynor crosses her arms as she cocks her head. Then she sighs.

""I know this isn't easy, James,"" her voice is slow and gentle -- gentler than usual, ""That adjusting to this new life isn't easy. I know you want to run away from it some days, but... That arm is who you are. It's part of you. Literally and metaphorically. If you hide that from someone you care about, you're hiding a part of yourself.""

""I'm not hiding anything.""

""Really?""

""No,"" he scoffs, ""No, no--""

""Does she have your phone number?""

He pauses. ""...What?""

""Your phone number,"" Dr. Raynor narrows her eyes, ""Does she have your phone number?""

""No,"" Bucky's eyes narrow. His tone was too defensive. Even he knew it.

She reads him in that second. ""Gimme the phone.""

For the second time that month, Bucky is sighing and digging that flip phone from his back pocket. He tugs it out of his black jeans and tosses it to Dr. Raynor. She catches it, flips it open. And stares.

""Oh, but you have hers. Which means either you're lying -- which wouldn't get you anywhere, you know that -- or you're putting distance between the two of you. Don't do that. It's not going to build a healthy relationship, James.""

""What, so I just give her my phone number?"" he asks, almost incredulous.

""Yes,"" Dr. Raynor nearly screams, waving her hands and looking to  the ceiling, ""It's about trust, James.""

""Well, I have a problem trusting people,"" he finally snaps with a dry tone, ""Can you blame me, doc? Really? Geez, it's like I'm being nailed to the cross here. It's all a habit. I... I get nervous. Trusting people was... never something I had to do. It was all orders and brainwashing and fuckin' buffet dinners of IV bags I could never pronounce. When I got out --""

His voice gets high and tight. He sighs. Bucky pinches the bridge of his nose.

""I'm trying, doc.""

""I never said you weren't,"" says Raynor after a minute of quiet, ""So keep trying. And let yourself be uncomfortable.""

He rubs his face. Dr. Raynor is standing now, and Bucky's eyes flick to the clock above her desk. His session is up.

As she stands, Dr. Raynor opens the door. ""Think about telling her, James.""

He nods.

""See you next week, doc.""


You're laughing.



You're laughing and Mom is saying something to Jaimie in the backseat, something about a seatbelt, and you can see his eyes rolling in the rearview as he pretends to clip it over his waist, but it's Jaimie and Jaimie is tall and lanky like Dad was and he cracks a joke about how he barely fits in the old station wagon's backseat while his legs are bowed and suddenly Mom isn't there but the car is still moving, moving, moving, moving --


Stop.

Your eyes are open.

Outside, a car drives by and the headlights dance on the ceiling. The sheets are clinging to you, suffocating you, and you can feel the inevitable, slow crawl of panic winding its way up your chest, pricking the skin of your cheeks. You're hot but you're freezing and you try, Christ alive you try, to remember how to square breathe.

This goes on for a long time.

Long enough that, when your 9am appointment finally comes and goes, you're still in bed.

Finally, you're asleep -- after hours of pacing when panic reached its horrible crescendo, exhausting you-- when your phone rings.

It vibrates mercilessly against your nightstand and stokes a sudden, hot flare of anger in your chest.

You roll, eyes half-open and slam your hand down to catch the phone. You drag it close, squinting. Muscle memory has you wanting to silence the call and throw the phone down and away; sleep is calling and it's quiet there, an escape.

But the caller ID makes you pause.


UKNOWN NUMBER
Brooklyn, NY


Your phone unlocks with a click. You flop onto your back.

You worry your brow with your fingers. Your eyes are closed.

""Hello?""


""You missed your appointment. That's not very self-care of you, y'know.""


You know that voice. With a quiet exhale, you blink into the morning sun pouring through the windows; the warm light is blurred by the curtains, and that happy, green monstera you've been nursing for months looks happy. You're jealous.

""I was sleeping, Bucky.""


""What?"" 


Swinging your legs over the edge of the bed, you're greeted by Poke -- he chirps as he pushes your bedroom door open and trots over. He's pushing his face against your legs as you stand.

""I had a long night.""

There's a pause.

Outside Dr. Raynor's office downtown, Bucky's brows are knotted tight.


""The good sorta long night, or...?""


You scoff and move to scoop up Poke. He meows quietly, assuming his usually swaddled-baby position in your arms. The phone is tucked under your chin as you speak. ""If you think I was out partying--""

""I dunno,"" Bucky mutters, rubbing the back of his neck as he looks up the street, ""You're young.""

""Why are you saying that like you're not, grandpa?"" with a shake of your head, you bend and let Poke land gently on the kitchen floor, ""Relax. I had a bad... dream, I guess.""

Bucky makes a point of kicking the nearby parking meter with the toe of his boot as he listens and tries to ignore the itch of his anxiety. This is the first time in, what, four weeks he hasn't seen you? He feels like a fuckin' puppy dog. Separation anxiety. And as much as it makes him freeze up, Dr. Raynor made a real good point this week that you're slowly becoming a permanent fixture in his life, even if it's for the twenty, thirty minutes he sees you every week before therapy.

Hell, it's more than he sees anyone nowadays.

And he needs to trust you.

He needs to stop putting up walls.

Especially with Steve... Y'know. Dying.

But, he doesn't wanna think about that. No, he's busy trying to remedy this sudden change in the routine he'd gotten used to. Usually on Tuesday's he heads to the diner on 6th street in Brooklyn, just a jog from his apartment, and sits with coffee and a paper. Breaking that portion of his routine was destined to send him into a spiral and... he's been good these last few weeks. Not so on edge. Like he's finally starting to live again.

""Wanna talk about it?"" he asks slowly, eyes squinting at the high rise behind him, ""I gotta eat anyways.""

On the other end of the phone, it's your turn to feel the edge of anxiety grace your heart. ""What do you mean?""

At your feet, Poke meows. You blink, apologetically frowning as you lean to dump his breakfast into his bowl. Bucky must have heard the meow, or maybe the nervousness in your voice, because he lets out one of those little scoffs of amusement he does. You can see the corners of his eyes crinkling in your head.


""You ever been to Dolly's? On 6th and 14th?"" 


A long time ago. Before the Snap. When... When things were different. But, you don't say that.

""I dunno, Bucky,"" you mumble, ""I dunno if... If I can handle... that.""


""That bad of a dream, huh?""


""It wasn't a dream,"" you say slowly, sagging a bit, ""A memory. You know how it is.""

Christ, does he. And he knows being alone with the echoes is worse than anything -- and sure, maybe Dr. Raynor has been telling him that for weeks but he didn't need her to say it to know.

""Well, get your shoes on. I'll meet you there. They have good pancakes.""

""Bucky--""

""C'mon,"" he barks and you can hear the smile, ""You know better than anyone that getting out will help.""

You groan. He's right. He's usually right, and even when he is, he is so fuckin' stubborn that it doesn't really matter -- like two weeks ago when he's called your jeans pedal pushers and for twenty minutes you had to sit and listen to him go on and on about how 'capris' didn't make any sense. You didn't have the heart to tell him that they were neither, just mom jeans rolled up over the tops of your sneakers. You sat there, staring at the bonsai and snickered.

Bucky is weird.

And petty, and stubborn, and particular and a bit distant.

But, so are you.

Maybe that's why you both got along so well.

""Fine,"" you mutter, petting Poke, ""But I'm paying.""


""No--""


""Yep, okay, see you soon, bye--""


""Don't you hang up on me--""


You do, and that explains the rather sour look on his face when you spot him outside Dolly's. He stands out like a sore thumb; all broad and bulky and scowling. It's warming up, and spring is almost here, but his usual jet-black, leather jacket hangs heavy on his shoulders. The gloves stay, too.

You don't ask -- you won't. That's Bucky's cross to bear.

You don't want to be rude. Not to your new friend.

""You're not paying.""

He mutters that lowly, nudging you with his shoulder when you follow him inside. Even with your face settled gently with a smile, he can see the pointed edge of anxiety flash in your eyes suddenly. It's busy in here -- nearly all the booths are taken, but there's one in the corner that he sees being bussed. It holds enough promise to quell your nervousness that he quickly flags down the waitress and points to the spot.

""Oh, hi there, stranger!""

Bucky offers the woman a smile you haven't seen before. It's nearly bashful.

""Hi, Frankie,"" he says warmly, ""Mind if we grab this one?""

""Sure, sure,"" she chirps, waving her hand as she moves back behind the counter, ""Want your usual?""

""Please,"" he smiles as he gestures for you to snag the booth side that faces the door -- and you squeeze his arm in quiet thanks, ""You want coffee?""

""Just water, please.""

When you finally settle in, you exhale.

Bucky, across from you, raises his brows.

""You okay?""

""You want me to be honest?""

""Always.""

""This is, like, the first time I've gone somewhere to eat in maybe a year,"" you shrug, ""So, a little rough. Sort of overwhelming. But, those pancakes that guy is eating at the counter do look good. So, worth it, I think.""

Bucky leans back, crossing his arms. ""Is it the people?""

""Always is.""

It hasn't always been but -- things got worse after the Snap.

You fiddle with the menu while Bucky takes to eyeing the people in the diner. He goes quiet -- mostly because he's thinking -- but it's enough to stir you out of the omelets section with a blink. From behind the menu, you raise your chin. Your eyes come over the edge of the pink and white menu and you watch Bucky watch something else. Behind thick lashes, your gaze narrows.

Then you follow his eyes to the jukebox in the corner.

""...Go on, then, Elvis.""

Bucky's head snaps to you. He's confused. His brows are all screwed up. ""Who?""

""Elvis... Presley?"" you shirk, squinting, ""Y'know. Hound Dog? Jailhouse Rock?""

Bucky's mouth is open, head shaking.

""... Burning Love?""

More silence. Your eyes are wide with silent shock.

""Heartbreak Hotel?!""

""I have no idea what you're saying to me right now,"" he says with a deadpan look that pins you in your seat with a comical look of disbelief, ""No idea. Why are... are all those names the same? They sound the same--""

""Are you being serious right now?""

""Completely,"" he nods, ""Oh, wait -- is he the one with the, uh, the white suit...""

""With the tassels and the rhinestones, yes--""

""Oh,"" Bucky nods, waving you off as he turns his attention back to his own menu, ""You're talking about that guy down in Times Square.""

Your jaw is still hanging open, but now you're looking around the diner like you'll find a hidden camera -- and then, that guy from the What Would You Do If Your Friend Didn't Know Who Elvis Was would pop out.

""No, Bucky--"" you're exasperated, ""That's... That guy is impersonating Elvis.""

""Why on Earth would he do that?""


""Oh my god--""


""Coffee! And water!"" cuts in Frankie, unknowingly giving a moment of respite from the ridiculousness Bucky seems not to understand. She's an older waitress with red lips and a big ol' pile of curls atop her head, ""And do we know what we want to eat?""


Thank God.


""Big Man Special for me, please,"" Bucky offers, folding up his menu and placing it back in it's slot by the salt and pepper. Again, unphased.

""Big Man Special for the big man,"" she cheeps with a flirty little swat of her pen, turning with a big, warm smile, ""And for you, pretty?""

""Two chocolate chip pancakes, please,"" you say, ignoring your own Big Man Special joke that's just waiting to spring off your tongue, ""And no onions in the home fries.""

""Perfect! Be out in a minute for you two.""

She disappears, and you squint at Bucky.

""You're weird, big man.""

That makes Bucky laugh -- mostly because you're right, but also because being weird has come as second nature while relearning how to live. The truth of it is he's old now, and though he may not look it, he feels every bit like he should be playing bingo with the old vets down at the VFA. In the years he'd been on ice, pumped full of enough benzodiazepines and amphetamines to slow his heart just enough to keep him teetering between life and death, he'd missed a lot.

Like Elvis, apparently.

He knew about Bruce Springsteen -- Steve liked him. Bucky wonders if Elvis is on that list Steve gave him to catch up on. Must be. He'll have to check when he gets home. It was extensive. He's gotten through some of it. It's just... overwhelming. Nothing's the same anymore. And it terrifies Bucky.

""Yeah, well, I used to be cool. Dunno what happened.""


Try a world war, HYDRA, and a vibranium arm, nerd. 


""Sorry for your loss,"" you chirp, ""But, I'm finding that sort of hard to believe, y'know.""

You're smirking. Bucky finds your eyes and his own smile is a hot flash of affection -- the sort he tamps down nice and quick because it scares him. He drums his knuckles against the table and leans back again.

""... You feelin' better?""

The jukebox begins playing a crooner's tune and you nod slowly. Your eyes move around the diner, and Bucky watches. There's a pull in the corner of your lips -- miniscule and oh so almost there -- when you speak. It's almost a whisper. You lean forward like you're telling a secret.

""I sort of forgot what it was like to feel like a real person,"" you pause, ""So thank you.""

""Stop it.""

""I'm serious--""

""It's not even noon,"" he has his usual deadpan expression on, ""You're not allowed to get sappy until noon. It's a rule.""

""That's not a rule and I'm not being sappy--""

""Yeah, it's a new rule I just made, and you're going to make me get sappy so watch it.""

You laugh out loud, then.

And Bucky's eyes crinkle, and you both sit in comfortable silence until the food comes.

You're matching his steps, hands up. Bucky is decidedly ignoring your theatrics, but you keep catching him sliding you a side-eye every time you throw them. He's tall and his strides are long and every few feet you have to hurry up to catch up.

Food was good -- very good. And worth it. And now, you feel normal. Not drowning in anxiousness. Maybe in need of a good nap, sure, but this feeling is foreign to you. Especially when Bucky laughs.

""What else haven't you heard of?"" you cry, ""First Elvis, now what? ABBA?""

He scoffs. ""You seriously think I haven't heard of ABBA?""

You gawk and you swat at his shoulder. Ouch. Fuck, he's solid.

""Bucky, I don't even know what to fucking think anymore--""

""Fernando! That's a good song. I like that one. And,"" he pops both hands up, all while his face remains decidedly emotionless, while coming to a stop at the crosswalk. He snaps his fingers, ""Uh, what's the one about money?""

""Money, Money, Money?"" 

""Probably.""

You snort out loud -- and Bucky grins up at the walk sign.

""Be honest,"" your banter feels like a game of tennis, ""Are you from another planet?""

""Try another century.""

He says it with a scary sort of seriousness that pricks a sudden feeling of suspicion. It's one that hadn't been there before -- but now the compounding conversations make more sense. And in this new age, anything is possible. Bucky must have seen the paranoia flash onto your face like a lightning strike because he's quick to nudge you with his good arm.

""Relax. S'a joke. Sort of.""


""... Sort of?""


""Yeah, well, maybe I'll tell you about it if you don't bail on therapy next week.""

You shoot him a look, nearing the steps of your apartment. ""Are you preaching to me about perfect attendance?""

""Hey, I'm on court order now -- I can't skip.""

You whirl around. ""What?!""

But Bucky's already moving down the street, grinning ear to ear with a mischievous look that has you wondering if he's even being serious -- he backpedals, foot traffic moving around him like salmon swimming upstream.

""Don't worry about it, Hound Dog,"" he shouts, ""See you next week.""

""Did you just call me Hound Dog?"" you holler back.

Bucky just laughs.

""Someone's in a good mood.""

You scoff, tossing your wet socks from one hand to the other before lobbing the pair into the dryer. You turn and serve the older woman leaning against the adjacent washer a look -- but, it's ferocity is tainted with the ghostly slip of a smile.

Bonnie McLayne, or as she insists to be called: Miss Bonnie, musters up a bellow of a laugh. The sound is crisp and cracks like an autumn leaf, no doubt from years of Marlboros and cheap whiskey. Her spindly fingers make work on her own basket of dried laundry. Her long skirt touches the unfinished floor and her jewelry tinkers like bells as she bends and sways and smiles.

""Little bit of Vitamin D?"" comes the next question, sunnied by her lipstick-painted smile.

She's the sort of woman that has remained forever radiant, even after years of youth-inspired wildness. She's a child of free love, of peace, of a whole life spent in this very Brooklyn apartment. She's got long, long hair that's greying; it's auburn color melting through the messy tendrils that hang from her usual bun.

Miss Bonnie is nice.

When the Snap happened, you had Poke. And you had Miss Bonnie.

""Stop it,"" you say quietly, shaking your head as you clear the lint filter. You're almost smiling.

""I was talking about the sun, y'know. It's almost spring, after all,"" she cheeps, dropping both hands to her waist, ""But that cheeky little reply told me everything I needed to know.""

""I am not --""

""What's his name? Her name?""

You just shake your head and give her a breathy laugh in response. ""Miss Bonnie...""

""Fine! Fine! You're right. None a' my business..."" she cries with a wave before dropping her tone and leaning forward to waggle her brows, ""A friend?""

""A friend,"" you reply sternly, shaking out an old sundress you'd pulled from your closet, ""And that's all it is.""

""Hey, kid,"" she swats the air as her voice grows tender and level, ""A friend is big for you. I'm glad. That's nice.""

Your movements slow. You pause, eyeing the fabric of the dress in your hands -- and you try to remember the last time you wore it. You find, rather immediately, that you can't. There's a sharp flare of fear that it won't fit you. You ignore it.

""Thanks, Miss Bonnie.""

She's passing you with a gentle touch of her long, delicate fingers. Bonnie touches your shoulder, pushes her glasses up her nose, and disappears up the stairs.

It's quiet. The only sound is the dryer.

You dig your phone from your pocket.

You type out a text to the number that called you earlier this morning.


if you're some sort of superhero i'll be pissed.


You learn about Bucky's past. He learns about yours.






""You know I have to ask these questions. It's part of the check-in.""


""Yeah,"" you fire back, flat enough to warrant Dr. Hart's scowl to grow. You can't see it over the phone, but you know the way her words whip around you means she's upset, ""I know.""

""If you're not following the action plan set out by the judge,"" she begins, leaning forward as her tone drops into a scalding hot sort of seriousness on the other end, ""You will go to prison. You know this. So, do you want to spend ten years of your life behind bars? Are you trying to get yourself locked up? Come on.""

You can't look up from your computer's screen. Or maybe you can, but right now, there's a dangerous mixture of anger and guilt and frustration boiling under your skin.

""I'm trying.""

""Trying isn't good enough for the GRC,"" Dr. Hart snaps, ""You know this. They're giving you a chance -- they know you're talented. You have the ability here to go straight, to earn a living, to finally make up for those years of blackhat work.""

""Everything I did,"" you fire back, ripping your eyes up to meet Dr. Hart's, ""Was for others. I didn't get a fucking penny.""

""You're not Robin Hood,"" she shakes her head as her tone softens, ""We all make mistakes. But, everything has a consequence. You know this. And this conversation isn't even considering the other charges.""

""You know the extortion case would never hold up in court.""

Dr. Hart sighs raggedly. ""And I don't intend on ever seeing it play out in court, because you're going to follow the conditions of your pardon.""

""The GRC is a bunch of fascists--""

""Enough,"" she snaps, ""If you want to go and appeal your case with the judge, be my guest, but I can almost guarantee you'll be perp-walked out of that Federal courtroom in cuffs.""

She's right.

Dr. Hart is right.

Your knee is bouncing, up and down and up and down. You're wound up around yourself, arms crossed tight, brows knotted. With a shaky exhale, you just nod. You breathe, and you remind yourself that she's right. She's right, she's right, she's right. It's not worth it. Dipping yourself back into that world, the layer of the web beneath the surface, isn't worth it.

The GRC is your way out.

Just be a good little girl and do as you're told.

""So, I'm going to ask you again,"" Dr. Hart begins, pen clicking alive on the other end of the phone call, ""...Have you engaged in any illegal activities online in the last seven days?""

Inessa Sidrova's photo stares up at him from its place on the speckled marble counter, stacked neatly next to his notebook where her name is scrawled in chicken scratch -- between two other names: Zemo and Henrikson.

His laptop, technically on loan from the FBI, sits beside both.

(When Barnes had agreed in that closed doors meeting to the conditions of his pardon, a certain FBI agent by the name of Jimmy Woo had been rather insistent that Barnes needed a personal computer in order to carry out his portion of the conditions insofar as tracking down the remaining HYDRA pawns in the States. Woo had also insisted, to the agreement of Dr. Raynor, that a personal computer would help better acclimate Barnes to the new world he'd been dropped into.

Woo was even nice enough to take an hour of his own time to show Bucky enough to get started -- but was whisked away for some investigation out in New Jersey.)

Bucky rubs the cold vibranium of his left palm into his eye, then exhales long and slow.

He's done all he can. And still, no leads on the woman.

Rounding the kitchen island, he digs his cell from his pocket. He goes back to staring at that text -- the one he'd laughed out loud at the moment it lit up his phone -- and he can feel that ol' bite of anxiousness creep into his arms. His fingertips tingle.

On the television, a laugh track plays over a clip of The Three Stooges. Blue eyes flick upward, and he partially wishes a ladder would put him out of his own self-induced misery.

Outside, the antics of a Saturday night in Brooklyn roll on.

In the last few days he's parsed through his thoughts enough to realize it's not telling you that scares him -- no, it's telling you the truth. The whole truth. All of it. After all, the good comes with a lot of bad; the sort of bad you chain in a chest and sink in the ocean. And Bucky finds that, even still, the good is questionable at best. The good is... small. Microscopic. Completely and totally tainted by the fuckin' decades of brainwashed, war dog bullshit.

He groans and drops his head back against the wall.

He tries, for the next twenty minutes, to formulate some sort of reply to your text message. But, half the battle is figuring out what to say, and the other half is actually typing it out. This whole flip phone purchase was really starting to sting like regret -- and as much as Bucky loved technology back before the war, and all the magical possibilities it held, he can't help but feel like an ornery old man now.

It's the change. Steve was right. Too much change.

He can't find the space button and he can't figure out how to delete the random 3 he'd accidentally punched in -- so, with a grumpy huff of disapproval, Bucky simply dials your number.

You pick up on the third ring.

""Don't you know it's Saturday?"" your voice is a welcomed sound, ""The History Channel is running a bunch of old war documentaries you might enjoy, grandpa.""

Bucky snorts, fiddling with the hem of his hoodie. ""What makes you think I'd wanna watch that shit?""

""Everyone knows that old men like two things,"" your voice is light, half-distracted from the sounds of it, ""World War Two, or grilling. And honestly, you don't strike me as the grilling type.""

""I like a good burger.""

""Yeah?"" you snort, and Bucky can hear you shift your phone from one ear to the other, ""Is that why you called? To hint at being hungry?""

""No,"" he exhales, looking out the window, ""No, I was trying to reply to your text but I can't find the fuckin' space button. Calling is easier.""


""Oh my god--""


""Shut up,"" he barks with a laugh, sitting up, ""Don't even start -- are you hungry?""


""Almost always, why?""


""Got any plans tonight?""


""... You do know who you're asking, right?""


Bucky grins, a little boyish and a little tired. ""Good point. Loser.""

""Oh, shut up. You're the one calling me to hangout,"" you snort, leaning to prop your feet up on your desk and lean back. Your chair wheels backward, far enough for you to get a good look down the street. It's a nice night, cool enough, and it seems like the whole borough is awake, ""But, I'm only hanging out if you tell me what the fuck is up with court-mandated therapy. I can't wait another three days.""

Your anxiety has been pricked the last few days over it.

""... Do I get to pick the place?""

You roll your eyes. ""Fine.""

""Great,"" he exhales tightly, ""I hope you're in the mood for sushi.""

Izzy's is busy, but there's privacy in the bustle.

Bucky had buzzed your apartment's ringer and you'd flown down the stairs, looking... alive. The sort of alive that was new -- like a fresh bud beginning to bloom in spring. It had made him grin, and he'd watched you push a tress of hair behind your ear as you decided it was warm enough for no jacket tonight. The light of the crosswalk sign lit you up like a star.

He was sweating.

Dr. Raynor was right -- that was it, of course it was -- that it was getting too warm for his usual outfit. So, he'd settled on the next best thing: a sweatshirt that was big enough and black enough that he could bury himself in it. His hands are tucked neatly into the pockets.

No gloves tonight.

He feels naked.

He shoulders the door and holds it open with the toe of his boot as you duck towards the back of the restaurant. There's a booth in the back by a large bamboo plant -- you weave through the place with a new found confidence. There's anxiousness in your shoulders but it melts when you look back at Bucky. Like a watchful guard dog, he nods.

You settle into the booth, toss your jacket in the corner, and smirk.

""I get out sometimes,"" Bucky remarks before you can even say anything. He shifts in the booth and reaches up to scratch his cheek with his right hand, ""Not often, but I do.""

""I didn't say anything...""

""You were going to,"" he nearly smirks back, his brows raised as he adjusts the chopsticks on the table, ""I know that look.""

You snort, nudging his boot under the table. That works a huffed little laugh out the man across from you. Almost immediately you can sense anxiousness rolling off him -- it's the tightness in his mouth that gives him away, the way he's fussing with the soy sauce dish and trying to get it to line up perfectly with the marbling on the table. Worry flashes in your eyes.

""Bucky.""

He raises his head.

""You alright?"" you ask quietly.

""You have to promise not to flip out.""

Your brows knot tightly -- but before you can even question what the fuck he means, he's casually dropping his other hand onto the table.

And you almost don't notice at first. Your brain fills the gaps in, figuring it's his glove. But, then you blink and his hand catches the light and you realize it's not leather. It's glittering obsidian, garnished with gold, and it's moving. Flexing. Seams bending and warping and there's a gentle hum coming from the appendages and you squint because he's tapping his fingers on the table and there's a metallic tik-tik-tik that meets your ears.

Then, your eyes jump to his face.

He looks pained.

You're confused.

And then you're not.


""You're --""


You slap a hand over your own mouth. You have to promise not to flip out. Your eyes are eighty miles wide and your jaw is falling open and you're leaning forward, whispering in a rushed tone because what the fuck.

""You're that Bucky?!""

Oh, you feel stupid.

The hostess appears, suddenly. You snap backward in the booth, Bucky tucks his hand away, and you both muster forced smiles to the waitress. She's young. Pretty. Her name-tag says Sarah.

She asks about drinks.

Bucky gets a beer.

Slowly, you knock your knuckles against the table and drop your head into your hand. The look on your face is exhausted. ""Do you guys have Mai Tais?""

The answer is yes. And you're glad. Because you're going to fucking need it.

The two of you are quiet until the drinks come -- avoiding one another's gazes for completely different reasons. Bucky is sheepish, a bit mortified, like he always is when people recognize him. It's why he shaved his fuckin' head. It worked well enough but... the arm was usually a dead giveaway.

Meanwhile, you're wondering if you could shave your own head and disappear. Because there's no easy way to explain the weird elation swirling in your chest right now.

Bucky's first to speak. His beer is in his good hand. He inhales quickly, eyes darting to you as he leans forward and whispers incredulously. He speaks quickly and his words are pointed with an edge of curiosity.

""...What do you mean 'that Bucky'?""

""Y'know, I knew there was a reason you acted like you needed a senior citizen discount. And you know exactly what I mean,"" you rush out all while waving your Mai Tai and jabbing the side with the umbrella towards him, ""Listen, this is a lot to take in, Mr. Avenger.""

""I am not an Avenger--""

""You helped reverse the Snap. You're the Winter Soldier. That makes you an Avenger--""

Bucky's shaking his head, eyes screwed shut tightly because the sudden equation to his past self being considered a hero is like being socked in the mouth. He stutters over his words and shakes his head more vigorously, like he's trying not to hear what you're saying.

""I am not the Winter Soldier. Not anymore. And it's not like I'm not on the fuckin' roster, doll--""

You hold a finger up, stopping him there, and take a long sip of your sunset-colored drink. You swallow. You exhale. Bucky swigs his beer.

""One, don't call me doll,"" you say curtly, then raise a second finger. You lean in and squint, ""Two... Christ, the haircut really makes a big difference, doesn't it?""

""That's what everyone keeps saying,"" he sighs raggedly, dismissing your scrutiny.

You puff your cheeks out and exhale. Leaning back in the booth, you try not to feel so fucking insane.

""...I can never have you over now.""

Bucky's brows narrow quickly and his eyes snap to yours. ""What?""

""I can't have you over,"" you explain slower with your eyes rooted to the soy sauce in the corner, ""Because I don't think I could ever handle you seeing my signed and framed Captain America poster from his USO tour in 1943.""

Bucky's face is deadpan. ""You're kidding.""

""I really wish I was,"" you gripe, ""It's an original.""

""...You're a Cap girl,"" he says suddenly, leaning back with this look in his eye. It's less of a question. You can't pin it down. It looks like he's damn near traumatized.

Bucky thinks -- honestly -- that this is the cherry on top. Every girl back then was a Cap girl, too. It figures, now, in this new century where he's making new friends that... as per usual, Steve gets the cake. That fuckin' pint sized bastard.

He'll have to tell him about this.

You yank your eyes up to Bucky's face. His mortification is shifting to surprise to amusement. You're fast to sit up, mouth opening to fire a retort -- but Bucky's suddenly really enjoying the look of pure horror on your face at the insinuation. He's smirking. Plain as day. He swigs his beer.

""No, no--"" you raise a finger, ""No, stop it. Don't make it fuckin' weird, Bucky, it's not like I have his name tattooed on my ass. And I knew a girl in college who did.""

His brows rise sharply and you're finding you're regretting everything that's coming out of your mouth.

""Stop looking at me like that,"" you guffaw, gesturing for him to show you his hand again, ""I wanna see.""

Bucky sighs and plucks his hand from his hoodie pocket.

With a sort of tenderness Bucky wasn't prepared to handle, you take his metallic hand into your own. There's an immediate twinge -- one that's procured by flashes of violence from years of being a walking weapon. He breathes, and he reminds himself that this arm is not the same that tethered him to HYDRA all those years ago.

This arm is his, it is not him.

The sensation is different. He isn't used to anyone touching him like this; he's used to the feeling of flesh on the other end of a punch, or a throat caught in his palm. Not the gentle pass of your fingers, delicate and purposeful, over his knuckles.

You turn over his hand, eyes alight with curiosity -- and Bucky, desperate to stamp out the hotness growing in his gut, moves quickly to flick your nose.


""Ow--""


""Don't stare,"" he says coyly, ""It's rude.""

The waitress is back. His hand is tucked away, and you wrestle the stupid expression off your face long enough to order a plate of assorted maki rolls and some fried tofu. Bucky orders what seems like his usual -- shrimp tempura and spicy tuna rolls.

The waitress, Sarah, disappears with a smile.

You're grinning.

""So... Does this make me the sidekick?"" you whisper playfully.

""Shut up,"" Bucky laughs, his lips almost darting into a smile.

You cock your head, pushing your chopsticks across the table with a horribly coy look on your face. It's comical. ""...I think this makes me the sidekick.""

""It -- stop it -- it does not make you the sidekick,"" Bucky says slowly as he sips his beer and pins you in the booth across from him, ""I'm not a hero. You'd have better luck asking Cap on that one.""

You grow silent. There's a question hanging on your tongue. You're wrestling with yourself -- Bucky can see that much. He frowns.

""Spit it out, Goose.""

You blink. ""Was that a Top Gun reference?""

""You wanted to be the sidekick.""

You wave it off, blinking into your Mai Tai. Your voice is quiet. Even as you speak, there's a hesitancy akin to walking on eggshells. ""What happened to Cap? Is he... alive? He's gone off the grid. It's, like, this massive conspiracy theory online.""

""He's upstate.""

You blink.

""That's ominous.""

Bucky shrugs. ""Someday I'll take you. It's... nice.""

You go quiet. You freeze, drink halfway to your mouth. Bucky can't help but smirk at that. His laugh is more of a scoff than anything.

""Relax, Miss America.""

""Shut up -- do you mean that?""

""What, that I think you're in love with Captain America?""

""No, you bastard, that you'll take me. To meet him.""

Bucky's words are easy. They roll off his tongue without a second thought. He feels... okay. Like this part is okay. Not as bad as he thought it could be. His anxiousness isn't as heavy now. He feels like he isn't losing you. But then again, he hasn't gotten to the bad part yet.

""He's my best friend,"" Bucky explains plainly, ""And so are you.""

The admission is warm. As easy as breathing. Two months in the making.

""Your only friend,"" you say quietly, offering the joke as a cover for the softening tone that dances over your words. It's affection, you realize, as you mimic his shrug, ""But, go on.""

""Thanks for the reminder,"" Bucky chirps, ""But, yea, I mean it. He'd like you.""

You raise your chin, wiggling a bit in the booth. It's pride -- and as much as Bucky likes the look of it, he can't handle the ridiculousness that comes along with it. But, it's sort of comforting. He knows this playfulness, this easiness, it's all because he's him. You trust him. In.a way, it strikes Bucky with guilt. There are walls of his still built up high. Maybe they're slowly coming down, but... he's like a stray dog, slow to trust.

""Safe to say,"" you breathe, ""I have a few questions.""

""I figured as much.""

You sip your drink and swallow. You raise a hand. ""But -- I wanna know the boundaries. I don't want to... I don't want to pry about shit I have no business knowing, alright? It's your life and even if we are friends, I don't need to know everything.""

The relief is almost immediate. He thumbs the label of his beer.

""Ask anything. But I can't promise I'll be able to give you the answers.""

""And I'll leave it at that,"" you say sternly, propping your elbow up on the table and offering your pinky finger, ""Until you want to talk about it. Promise.""

He crooks his pinky in yours, squeezing gently. You smile.

Sarah comes back with the food, and then Bucky offers his usual half-exhausted, half-amused smirk.

""You get three questions now. Then, we shut up and eat.""

You fold your hands neatly over themselves, eyeing your food as you try your best to sort out what questions come up with the most urgency. There's... a lot. I mean, everyone knew about the Avengers -- and everyone had their opinions. The Sokovia Accords, Lagos, the Blip... and SHIELD. Years of bullshit culminating around those who were considered the heroes. The kickback usually ended up on everyday citizens like you. After the initial amazement, the reality of it all set in.

But, to Bucky's point, he wasn't really an Avenger.

Nowadays, there really wasn't a team at all. No up-state compound, no leader, no Stark and no Rogers.

You're sure the GRC will try -- that the military will try. Morale and hope and blah, blah, blah. 

You narrow your eyes. ""How old are you?""

It's quick. ""One hundred and six.""

""How'd they keep you alive that long?""

There's a wince that flashes across his face like he's been stabbed with a white-hot poker in the ribs. You see a twitch of irritation bubble across his lips. Not with you. No, it's that this question is still hard for him to answer. Bucky exhales sharply.

""Next question.""

You feel a pang of guilt flare in your chest. You move along.

""Who kept you alive that long?""

""The Russians. HYDRA, if you wanna get specific.""

You exhale and settle on the fact you now have more questions than answers. But, you nod and snatch up your chopsticks. Enough of the twenty questions game.

In all honesty, it's not like Bucky's existence was common knowledge. The Winter Soldier was known mostly, sure, to those who had floated in the same circles as him when he was nothing but a rabid cur on a choke chain. He can't help but be a bit thankful for the minor erasure of his new self -- sure, in the eyes of the U.S. government he was a high-level threat to be reintegrated as soon as possible and surveyed at all times. But, to the average New Yorker, he was just another person. Everyone was so used to seeing the heroes in their costumes with their bigger than life personas and...

Bucky was just Bucky.

Even he didn't really know who that was. He was starting to.

His pardon had come with some flak from some of the more political news outlets but... somehow, the details of the Winter Soldier's exact crimes were being kept silent. Probably to avoid panic. And, even then, the connection between the newly alive James Buchanan Barnes and The Winter Soldier hadn't been made yet in the public eye. He was glad.

The haircut definitely helped.

It's like he was a walking classified redaction.

Bucky has a sushi roll in his mouth when he finally speaks. ""For such a Captain American fan, I'm surprised you didn't recognize me.""

""Oh, you're really not gonna let that go, huh?"" you say as you chew, covering your mouth. You swallow and waggle your chopsticks at him, ""Listen, it's been a while since I've... y'know, had my Avengersphase. That was years ago. It was at its peak when I worked for SHIELD. And besides, you're kinda new to the whole superhero scene.""

Bucky frowns. ""You worked for SHIELD...?""

""For a year,"" you say tightly, ""Back before the collapse.""

""Only a year?""

""It was for my graduate program,"" you wave it off, ""I won out on the most competitive internship NYU had to offer. I was working within their cybersecurity division. I will say I spent more time trying to sort of email phishing scams than anything else, though. I'm sure they saw my record and wanted to keep me away from the juicy stuff.""

Bucky squints.

You offer a sheepish shrug.

""I got into trouble when I was younger,"" you sip your drink and sigh, ""I always liked computers. I used to spend all my time on forum sites just... reading and talking to people and figuring out how these sites actually worked, so learning how to write my own code was just the next step. When I was fifteen, I learned how to tap phones. At sixteen, I was hijacking my neighbor's internet connections and remotely controlling his laptop.""

""Sounds like a good time.""

""Yea, well, he was a sitting Senator who was having an affair with the nanny,"" you mutter, ""And I was stupid enough to try and blackmail him for cash. I wish I could say I learned my lesson.""

Bucky exhales long and hard at that, like he knows where that snap of misguided judgment goes. It's not like he's passing judgment onto you, but... like he knows the feeling. And you manage to not feel so small, then -- telling him this is easy. It's not your favorite part of your life by any means, but Bucky is listening. Really listening.

He fiddles with the paper wrapper of the chopsticks.

""So, less a Goose and more a Kevin Poulsen type, huh?""

You snort. ""For an old man, I'm surprised you know who that is. But, I wasn't hacking into the Pentagon at seventeen. I was too busy doing community service.""

""HYDRA had their eyes on him in the 90s,"" Bucky mumbles through a bite of spicy tuna, the memory popping into his mind and flying out before he can stop it, ""I remember... I thought his username was stupid.""

""Oh, you didn't like Dark Dante?""

""Like I said,"" Bucky chortles, ""Stupid.""

""You wouldn't have liked mine, then,"" you smirk lightly, ""It's worse.""

Bucky raises his brows, somehow doubting that entirely. ""Really?""

""...I was hackrabb1t for a long time. Y'know, with a 'one' for the 'i',"" you cringe, ""People kept thinking I was a furry.""

There's a pause. Bucky's face is set in an unreadable emotion. It's confusion mixed with amusement mixed with... something else. When he speaks, he clears his throat and tilts his head.

""It's clever. But,"" a pause, ""What is a furry? I've been seeing that word all over PlentyOfFish.""

Your jaw flies open. You raise your hands as your head reels around. Bucky has a look on his face like he knows, he knows he shouldn't have asked and he definitely shouldn't have given you enough context to know where he's seen that phrase before, because now you're looking at him like he has seventeen heads and they're all on fire.

""Y'know what, nevermind--""

""--Oh, no, no, there's way too much to unpack here,"" you lean forward, ""You're on PlentyOfFish?""

""ChristianMingle wasn't really my speed -- stop laughing.""

""Shut up -- stop it, stop -- this is too much,"" you say with a high voice, ""If you get catfished, I'm not helping you track the person down...""

""--What the hell is a catfish?"" he nearly cries, raising both hands in a desperate shrug, ""I don't even know what any of these words mean.""

""Oh, you sweet, naive, innocent, man--""

""No, no, no, no,"" he chirps, raising a finger with a deadly look of seriousness on his face, ""No, I am not naive or sweet or any of the above. I'll take 'cute', sure, but none a' those.""

""Is that what the furries call you on PlentyOfFish? Cute?""

He drops his head back against the booth and stares at the ceiling.

""Our friendship was a mistake, rabbit.""

You choke out a laugh. ""Shut up, you walking claw machine.""

You're both laughing now -- quieter but sustained and every time you think you've calmed down enough to sip your Mai Tai, you just have to look at the distraught, scruffy man across from you to break into another fit of muffled laughter. Finally, after what feels like forever, you both manage to calm down enough to finish the plates in front of you.

There's a warmth that's settled in Bucky's chest -- it's eaten away at the usual jitter in his legs, the anxious twitch of his fingers. It's a different emotion. Acceptance, maybe. Comfort. Affection.  

Then, while you're piling the last bit of sushi rice into your mouth when your phone, set on the side of the table, begins to go off. It hums erratically, dancing in a circle, and all you do is stare at the name flashing across the screen. You're smiling, hugging her. It's from Jaimie's wedding -- out in some big, wide-open orchard with the sun setting behind you. The picture there is old; you were both different people then.

Before... everything.


MOM Morristown, NJ


You scowl and stare.

Bucky blinks.

""You gonna get that?""

Quickly, you snap out of it. You reach and silence the buzzing with two quick taps. Quietly, you offer up a somber sigh.

""I never do.""

Bucky frowns again, this time with a worried look that digs deep into his eyebrows. You ignore it on purpose, pushing your plate away and leaning back in the booth. He knows what you're doing -- you're avoiding his gaze, and therefore his own questions.

""Rabbit.""

""Oh, is that my new nickname, then?""

""It fits,"" he chirps before crossing his arms, strategically hiding his metallic hand, ""What's up?""

You grow quiet -- then it spills out.

""I can't talk to her.""

""Why?""

You chew your lip. You bite your tongue and you hold back on the finer points of your anger -- ones dredged up by the still present sting of your check-in with Dr. Hart this afternoon.

Here it comes.

""As a part of my pardon, I was ordered no-contact with my family,"" you exhale, controlling the level of your voice, reciting the court papers you'd read over and over and over, ""It was deemed that further contact would impact my progress towards reformed behavior and judgment.""

Bucky's eyes are wide. His jaw is tight.

""What the fuck do you mean 'pardon'?""

It's your turn to cross your arms now, to ignore the sting of his look. It's the kind that screams disappointment more than anything. You hate that you're getting it from Bucky of all people.

""Like I said, I didn't learn my lesson when I was a kid,"" you shirk, ""Last year I was arrested on a number of counts -- I'd been evading the FBI, CIA, all of them, for years. I was doing it all for people like me. The ones who got left behind.""

Bucky's tone is flat. It's serious. His next sentence is less of a question, more of an order. The cadence is rhythmic and it reminds you of your brother the night he found out about the first time you'd been arrested; you decide, then, that Jaimie and Bucky would have gotten along.

""What did you do?""

""Whatever I could,"" you wave your hands, ""Identity theft, falsified documents, insurance fraud. Anything. There were people, like me, that in a blink, lost everything. Accidents, deaths, evictions and no one did anything for us. The insurance agencies wouldn't cover damages related to The Snap. Life insurance policies, social security... It all got snatched up by people at the top while the system collapsed around us. I had to pay for my brother's funeral out of pocket. And there were hundreds of thousands of people just like me, just trying to get by. And everything failed us.""

Bucky is stuck in silence. It's like mud, dragging him to the bottom of a pond -- the sort that's dredged with misery. In an instant, his veins are on fire with an anger he hadn't felt in a while. It manifests itself in the tightening of his jaw. He rubs his face and props his elbows up on the table.

""Why won't they let you see your family?""

You fiddle with your napkin.

""My brother... His wife was on maternity leave when she disappeared in the Blip,"" you mutter, ""She came back to no job, a dead husband, and no home. Their apartment complex had been abandoned. She's trying her best to make ends meet. She lives with my Mom in our old home. Neither of them can find work. They... The court thought that I'd be influenced to do something if I was around them.""

""What, like help?""

""They see me as a criminal,"" you manage, ""But I'm useful, so they're keeping me around.""

Silence falls between the two of you once more -- and the sad look on your face makes Bucky's chest tight. He can see anxiety beginning to spill over; you're wringing the napkin, fiddling with the edges. Suddenly, Bucky realizes you're feeling exactly how he was an hour or so ago.

Your voice is soft. ""I'm sorry. I was going to tell you.""

""Looks like we're two birds of a feather,"" he says, knocking the toe of your sneaker with his boot, ""Listen, we all do stupid shit. I've got a lot worse weighing me down. I get it.""

You look up, sadness glistening in your expression like sun off a lake. It's harsh. He wants to look away.

He doesn't.

""... So, that means you're good with computers?""

That's how you find yourself in Bucky's Brooklyn apartment at almost midnight, wandering behind him in the long halls and watching curiously as he digs his key from his pocket and shoulders the door open.

It's a small apartment. One bed, one bath, a kitchenette and that's really it.

For its size, it's hardly lived in.

You suppose it makes sense -- Bucky didn't have a lot of personal belongings, and with the hints he'd dropped about his life before The Blip, you were beginning to understand that he may have never really had that much to begin with.

There's a blanket on the floor by the television and a single couch pillow. It's tucked in the corner, behind a small sofa. There's a chair in the living room, one from an old dining set. At the kitchen counter, there's a stack of papers and a single laptop. Even though all the kitchen's wares are older models, the bones of the apartment are good. Bare, but good.

You stop in the doorway to the bedroom and stare at the untouched bed. The sheets are tucked tightly in the corners -- there's something militaristic about it. Across the hall is the bathroom. It's small. You can see a few amenities scattered across the sink's top.

Being in here feels something like an open wound.

It was lonely. Quiet. Cold.

""We need to make a trip to HomeGoods,"" you mumble as Bucky flicks on the lights, ""I get the whole minimalist thing, but sheesh.""

""I don't have a lot,"" he says, kicking off his boots by the door and shrugging off his jacket, ""And I don't need a lot either.""

You watch as his shoulders sag a bit, like he can finally let down his guard just a little in his own space. It's endearing. You perch yourself up on the kitchen counter as your eyes follow him; he moves to fling open a cabinet and grabs a mug. Then, he hesitates.

""You want tea?"" he asks over his shoulder.

""Tea?""

""Dr. Raynor said,"" Bucky reaches for a container of tea bags from the top shelf. His henley lifts enough to flash a bit of skin along his lower back and you swear you see a scar, ""It would help with my anxiety.""

You swing your legs a little. ""Then sure.""

""You can use my Captain America mug,"" he chirps, laughing a little to himself, ""Seeing as you're such a big fan...""

""God, I regret even saying anything to you,"" you spit as you hop down and lean around him to get a look at the mug, ""Did you seriously buy that?""

""It was a gift.""

""Bullshit.""

Bucky snorts as you shake your head and wander backward, eyeing the rest of his apartment with a bit of astonishment. It's really nothing impressive -- but, you suppose it makes sense. Whatever meager disbursement that the government was willing to give Bucky for his efforts in fixing the Snap was better than nothing.

Your gaze hangs on the blanket in the corner.

He watches you, and he notes the sore sadness that dissolves your posture at the sight of the nest in the corner. A bit of shame colors his cheeks as he heats up the water. When Bucky speaks, it's slow.

""The bed was too soft. I couldn't sleep on it,"" he shifts from foot to foot and focuses on taking the tea bags out and methodically wrapping the strings around the handles, ""Dr. Raynor said that's a typical thing for soldiers to experience when they come home from war.""

You're quiet for a while after that, only speaking when he rounds the counter with your tea. He offers it up with a tilt of the head.

""You never got to come home, though, right?""

""No,"" comes the short reply as you both watch the lights outside the window, ""No, I didn't. Not until now.""

You nudge his arm with yours. You lean a bit. Bucky leans back.

""I'm sorry.""

""Don't be,"" he manages after a sigh and sip of the tea, ""I can't just feel sorry for myself anymore. I'm trying to fix the wrongs I did -- and that's why I need your help.""

You quirk a brow. He reaches around you and grabs the stack of papers on the counter. With a steady grip, Bucky presents the photo of a woman who looks strikingly familiar. You can't place her face, but there's something about her that feels like a slap across the cheek. She's young here, in a faded photo with tattered edges. Beside her is a man who is laughing. The photo is candid, and they're both beautiful. They're both wearing a uniform -- but you can't place the era or location.

You turn to Bucky for answers.

""Back in the 70s, at the height of the Cold War, HYDRA was working in tandem with the Russians to spy on American forces,"" he offers easily, staring out the window, ""The American HYDRA cell hadn't yet been planted. This man, Andrei Kuznetzov, was a spy. He was feeding the Americans information on the Russian nuclear program. His wife, the one in the photo, was ordered to kill him. She refused.""

Bucky's fingers twitch.

His words are soaked through with pain.

""I,"" he continues, ""killed him.""

You hold your breath. Then you spare him a mournful look.

""Inessa Sidrova went on to help form the same HYDRA cell that ended up taking over SHIELD here in America,"" Bucky mumbles, ""She's dangerous. There are others like her, ones who I helped create, all over the world. But, she's my top priority. I just haven't had much luck tracking her down.""

""That's why you need my help.""

""I'm 106 years old,"" Bucky deadpans, ""The microfiches at the library were getting a little tedious.""

""But,"" you chirp with a sly smirk, ""You figured out how to set up a PlentyOfFish account?""

He shoulders you again as you sip your tea and laugh.

""Shoulda never said anything,"" Bucky grumbles, ""Dr. Raynor thought it was a good idea. Y'know, to get back out in the world.""

""I can promise you,"" you say with a stern shake of the head, ""The metal arm will get you plenty of chicks and dudes in due time.""

""Good to know,"" Bucky replies as his words lilt with a playful sort of questioning that you purposefully ignore. You're not feeding his ego today. Maybe tomorrow, after you take a crack at figuring out where this woman is.

It's going to be a long night.

You meet Steve Rogers, and Bucky Barnes goes on a date.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


MOSCOW, 1975.



In all the years that James Buchanan Barnes has had a heartbeat, he'd come to know the sounds of grief well.

War taught him a lot of things -- that they were all just little boys playing with guns, and that no matter how many times you thought you'd be ready for the vomit-inducing pungency of violence, you never were. In the end, you'd do anything to save yourself; you'd crawl through the thick of death and debris a million times over if only to cling to the shredded tatters of your own humanity.

You would kill someone else's son for the sake of your own mother.

War was disease that devoured every part of you -- it was gunpowder snuff and carved flesh. That sickness -- inky and desperate -- had sunk deep into this heart during the war, and it crescendoed to the sounds of mothers clutching dead sons. The sounds that followed death were like a hollow opera. Waning and wailing.

In the raucous wake left by warborn grief, Bucky drowned every time.

To the Winter Soldier, the operatic quality to the sounds of grief were as insignificant as a child's rhyme.

He did not drown. No, he waded through the waves, comfortable in the cold and unphased by the stinging cut of loss. That was not something he could comprehend. After all, there were orders and there were targets, and everything in between was absolute.

He was the disease that devoured all.

He's holding a gun to Andrei Kuznetzov's head in a dining room with ornate trim -- with silverware as delicate as scalpels that tinker against fine china. The carpets are red, the curtains are red, there's blood on the table cloth. The guests continue to eat. Kuznetzov's wife is screaming, red nails dug so deep into the dining chair's arms it's carving out the fabric. War dogs, like him, keep her rooted in her seat, and her tears find polished boots. She's begging and bartering but the man with Kuznetzov's life in his hands is not listening. He is eating his veal, bloodied meat dancing between his lips. He takes a sip of wine as his medal emblazoned chest glimmers in the light of crystalline chandeliers.

The spoils of war.

His smile is stained red.

There is no deal to be made.

The Winter Soldier pulls the trigger.


NOW.


His eyes are open.

Panic is the first emotion he feels, and it seizes him up quickly in its grasp. He doesn't know this view, he doesn't know where he is, not again, not again, not again --

Then:

""Good morning, sleeping beauty. Did you know you snore?""

The relief that the sound of your voice brings is immediate, and just like that he remembers. He's laying on the bed. You're sat up across from him at that small desk in the corner. He reaches as he rubs his face to thumb the edge of the pillowcase. He exhales tightly.

He's fine. His name is James Buchanan Barnes. He is not longer the Winter Soldier. He's in his Brooklyn apartment. He is fine.


When's the last fucking time he's slept in a bed?


He sits up, scratching his neck as he does. You lean back, half rotated in the desk. Before you is a mess of papers and his laptop -- and on top of the keyboard sits his notebook. It's open to the page where all he'd been able to figure out about Innessa was scrawled in his chicken scratch.

Bucky swings his legs over the edge of the bed and immediately his back complains.

""How long was I out?"" he asks, voice hoarse with sleep. He moves to part the curtains. The room blooms with warm morning light.

You offer an apologetic smile into the vanilla sunshine. ""Three hours. I wanted you to get some shut-eye. You were starting to look a little overwhelmed last night--""

""You click too fast,"" he waves, standing and immediately rolling his neck to the side. You watch as the man, before as peaceful as a sleeping pup, now regains his usual thinning veiled level of threat. Bucky is dangerous -- it shows in the way he holds himself. He cracks his neck, rolls his shoulders, and groans. He exhales again, posture sagging a bit, ""I couldn't keep up.""

You're standing now, socks padding against the hardwood as you eye his cowlick with a budding bloom of affection. With his notebook between your index and middle finger, you offer it out. You cling to your empty coffee cup in the other.

""I didn't peek,"" you say warmly, ""Pinky promise.""

His laugh is more like a hot puff of air. Bucky manages a look that feels like an emotional dethaw.

""Thank you.""

You lead the way to the kitchen, stretching your own back as you go. You'd been up all night -- this is your third trip out here for yet another cup of coffee. The pot has been on for too long, though, and you know the coffee sitting there is beyond bitter. You're moving to dump it down the sink when Bucky grumbles.


""Don't.""


""You want it?""

""No,"" he mutters, reaching for a mug, ""But I don't want to waste it.""

""Wow,"" you chirp, ""The Great Depression just jumped out.""

""Yeah,"" he snorts, yanking open the fridge to search for something to eat, ""It does that.""

""Well, grandpa,"" you hand him the steaming cup and set out to make another pot, ""You're also living on Depression Era rations -- might I suggest some Dolly's? Because I'm starving and I've been up all night and I think that means I get to decide where we get breakfast.""

Bucky's look is soft -- but you don't see it. You're too busy scooping sugar into your cup, too busy nudging him aside to grab the milk. He's rooted there in the kitchen, watching you move about. You're comfortable. There isn't a trace of anxiousness in you, not in this moment, and he tries to remember what it looks like.

Your eyes find his and he clears his throat.

""Earth to Sergeant Barnes?""

""Don't start,"" he groans, albeit playfully, ""It's too early.""

""Oh, what? Too early for me to grill you on why you didn't tell me that little laptop in there was on loan from the FBI? To one Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes of the 107th?""

His face falls.

""Don't worry,"" you raise a hand quickly, leaning against the counter as you sip your coffee, ""I figured that out before I did anything massively illegal.""

Bucky rubs his face as he takes a sip of his coffee -- the bitterness is enough to slap him awake. He winces, swallows it back, and remembers the taste of instant coffee made in helmets on the line in Bastogne. He can smell snow, and the acrid sting of mortar smoke. Suddenly, he's craving a cigarette.

That hasn't happened in a while.

Bucky clears his throat. ""Did you find anything?""

You frown slightly, lips pulled as you hide your inward disappointment -- you push off from the counter and shake your head as you brush past him. Like a loyal dog, Bucky follows. Into the bedroom you go, and Bucky's again surprised he managed to get any sleep at all in that bed. Maybe it was the comfort of having someone else there, or the genuine exhaustion that had finally choked him out after hours of trying to understand what the hell you were even doing on there.

You plop into the desk chair and snatch up a piece of paper littered with notes.

""I couldn't do much of my usual snooping,"" you explain gently as you gesture to the chromebook, ""This thing might have been given to you in good faith, but they're watching you pretty closely. So, I worked a little magic and ended up running a virtual machine. Gave me enough wiggle room to avoid the malware and keystroke trackers. Even still, I wanted to be careful, so I just did a little looking.""


""Looking?""


""I can't dig deeper on Innessa, I know where to dig, but I can't,"" you frown, ""Not on this laptop, and definitely not on my personal machines. I've got the GRC breathing down my neck, and the files I need to poke are very much off-limits.""

""So, what? We're shit out of luck?""

""No, not entirely,"" you stand up and motion to the paper in your hands; your tone is tight, ""I know a few people who can help, but getting to them is going to be the hardest part.""

Bucky takes the paper, squinting at the writing as you settle on the edge of the bed next to him. You take a sip of your coffee and watch as his blue eyes dart across the notes; you point to the name scrawled across the top.

""There's a club in lower Manhattan, but you've gotta know the right people to get in,"" you mumble, scratching your cheek as a creeping sense of embarrassment bubbles up behind your words, ""It's in the basement of an old computer repair shop. It's like a blackhat networking event, but with strippers.""

Bucky squints at the paper and reads the name. ""The Glass Cannon?""

""Yeah,"" you huff, crossing your arms tightly as you stand, ""That's the one.""

Bucky looks up from the paper, attention now rooted on the pacing you've begun to do across the room. Back and forth. You're holding your coffee like a lifeline, gaze far away. That anxiousless way you'd been holding yourself before is gone. Now, he can see the tensing in your shoulders, in your fingers. You're suddenly nervous.

Bucky stands. His voice is gentle.

""You alright?""

""Yeah,"" you snap almost immediately, ""Just, y'know. Worried. I spent a lot of time there when I was younger. Did stupid shit. And now I'm about to waltz in after six years like I haven't put that part of my life behind me.""

""We don't have to do this,"" he says immediately, moving to stand closer and halt your pacing. The invasion of your space forces you to look at him. His fingers glimmering in the morning light. You follow the line of his figure up to his eyes. The emotion there makes your heart clench. You can't pin it down, and it's gone in an instant.

""It's the only way we're going to find Innessa.""

""You don't need to put yourself in situations like this for me,"" he says, stressing the for me part in both expression and tone. The depreciation makes you wince and you're fast to shake your head.

""That's what friends do, Bucky,"" you stand your ground, but you know there's more to your reasoning than that, ""Plus, she's a bad guy. And I know you said I technically wasn't the sidekick, but--""

""You're not the sidekick--""

""I know,"" you huff, nudging him gently with your arm, ""But, I wanna help. Do some good.""

""You do enough good,"" he mutters, ""You're a good person.""

Your words fail you at that -- and your mouth parts but nothing comes out. Bucky watches with an expression as solid as rock as you blink and look away. His hand, the one of flesh and bone, finds your wrist as you tighten your grip on your mug.

The touch, though far too tender for you to handle, feels like fire.

Like a slap in the face, you're reminded of how handsome Bucky is.

You slap that thought back, trading volleys, and remain quiet.

His tone is stern. ""I mean it.""

""Well,"" you finally muster, tone dipping sardonically into a cruel peel of humor, ""Just wait until you see me in my natural habitat. Maybe the tequila shots will make you second guess that.""

""I didn't know we were going out drinking,"" he chirps as he raises an eyebrow, ""Am I going to need to get you a leash?""

""We're gonna have to try and blend in as best we can. People are going to know me -- if they try to pin me with the GRC or the feds, we aren't going to get anything on Innessa. They probably won't even let me in the building if they suspect something's up, after all not everything that goes down in Glass Cannon is kosher.""

""This is already sounding like a bad idea,"" Bucky mumbles as he crosses his arms, ""I'm stating that for the record, by the way.""

""Well, I think standing around and working ourselves up about this is even worse of an idea,"" you chirp back, moving towards the door to muscle on your shoes, ""So I say we feed ourselves and don't worry about this until Thursday night.""

""Thursday.""

You nod.

All of a sudden, Bucky's eyes go wide.

""Today is Sunday.""

You freeze, hand on the doorframe. You shoot him a wide-eyed look at the sudden flare of panic that's shot up through him. ""Yea, Bucky, today is Sunday.""


""Shit.""


""What?"" you nearly cry as he disappears into the bedroom once more. You hear his closet open, then a clatter as he grabs something like keys -- you nearly run directly into his chest when he strides back into the kitchen. He's shouldered on his usual leather jacket, and in his hands is another.

He's got keys in his hand.

""C'mon.""

He shoves the jacket into your arms and you frown.

""What the hell?"" you cry, doubling back to snag your phone and bag as Bucky moves to the door, ""What is this?""

""Put it on,"" he says, holding open the door for you as you follow him into the apartment hallway.

You raise a brow and stand there as he locks the door.

""Why?""

""Because,"" Bucky mumbles, rubbing his face as he widens his strides to the stairwell across the hall; before you know it, you're desperately trying to keep up as he bounces down the steps -- light on his feet like the boxer he is -- towards the lower level of the apartment complex, ""We're late.""

You groan, trying to shrug on the jacket that smells like Bucky as you follow -- a smell you'd come to know as clean laundry and sandalwood. Must be something for his hair. He never wore cologne, that much was apparent. The jacket is big on you, especially on the shoulders. You were swimming in it, trying not to trip as he held the door open to the garage.

Suddenly, the air is cooler. Immediately you wonder how much his rent is if he had access to a ground level garage. Call it NYC instinct.

""Bucky,"" you nearly whine, throwing your head back, ""Where are we going?""

Before you get a reply, you run straight into his back. Bucky grunts, moving to grab both of your hands and push you to the front of him.

Sitting in the spot is a motorcycle.

It's a jet black Harley.

Bucky is handing you the helmet on the back seat as your mouth moves in disbelief. ""No way-- no, I'm not getting on that thing. I'd rather sell my kidneys. Stop, stop -- ow, Bucky -- you haven't even said where we're going!""

He's muscling the helmet onto your head and through the flash of the visor you can see a real smile, the sort born out of his never-ending amusement towards your fickle sense of humor. His fingers are nimble against your chin. He takes the time to strap it on, adjust it, and give it a gentle tug. Bucky taps the matte black helmet twice, then flicks the visor down.

""We're going upstate.""

It takes two hours to get to Elmwood Senior Living.

You spent the first forty-five minutes clinging to Bucky's waist with your eyes closed -- no fault of Bucky's, really. It was different from riding in a car by miles, and you had your own qualms with driving. You couldn't be in the passenger's seat anymore. Not after the accident with Jaimie, when Mom disappeared. Being out of control made you itch; and it's not until the fifty-minute mark that you ease up on the panic and remember who the man is that's driving the bike.

You trust Bucky. You trust him with your life.

Once it's open road, winding up towards the Northern part of the state, it gets easier.

Bucky can feel your grip around his waist loosen just a bit -- and it's enough reassurance that he stops looking back in the mirror every fifteen seconds. It's enough permission to open up on the throttle, and the bike roars alive. Your immediate reaction is a gobsmacked yelp, the sort that's pulled from a jolt of shock, but then comes the laugh. 

Bucky's own quiet chuckle rumbles against your chest. You hold on tighter, but this time with open palms against the thrum of his ribs.

Halfway through the trip, he pulls into a McDonald's.

You drop your ass onto the parking lot's curb as he leans against the bike and houses a burger. You laugh, eyeing him candidly as you take a large bite from your own lunch. Bucky is a mess with it -- cursing quietly when he ends up getting ketchup on his jacket.


""Shit.""


""Jesus, Bucky,"" you mutter, ""Did you even taste that thing?""

""Barely,"" he clears his throat and starts picking at his fries, ""These things taste different now. First time I ever had McDonald's was right before bootcamp.""

""How much was it? Five cents?"" you snort, leaning back and dropping a fry into your mouth.

Bucky watches with a half-smirk. ""Fifteen, but nice try.""

He spends the next five minutes on his hand with a wet nap, trying hard to get the grease out of the delicate plates along his palm. You watch, as you knock back the rest of your soda, as his eyes crinkle tightly in frustration. His mouth is pulled tightly into a fine line. For the second time today, you're reminded of how handsome Bucky Barnes is -- and how fucking stubborn he is, too.

""Want help?""

""No,"" he mutters, trying to get a spot between his thumb and index finger, ""I got it.""

""I have smaller fingers,"" you sing-song, gathering up his trash and your trash and crossing the parking lot to the bin; upon returning, you waggle them in his face, ""Good for hard to reach places.""

Bucky absolutely hates that can feel his blush hit the tips of his ears at the comment.

He's glad you're too preoccupied with his hand to notice. You're watching, like you always do, with respectful awe. To you, this part of him is a bit like a treasure -- you find it beautiful and intriguing and incredible. It's clear in the way you watch the mechanisms turn and tighten that you aren't frightened by it.

It unsettles Bucky every time.

Finally, once he's finished under your watchful eyes, he leans to muscle that helmet back over your head. You groan, squinting tightly.

""C'mon,"" he knocks your helmet with his knuckles, ""We're almost there.""

The rest of the ride is wide open space, farmland and mountainous peaks looming far ahead. It's warm, and the sun is hot on your back. The wind is howling around you and it sends your jacket collar flapping against your neck. Your chin rests neatly on Bucky's shoulder, trying to get a view of the road ahead.

Elmwood Senior Living is tucked into the back of a suburb.

The two of you weave through a neighborhood or two, dancing under the shade of age-old maple trees. They cast long, scattered shadows across the pavement as kids play on their lawns. A dog barks somewhere in the distance. Over the hill, church bells ring. Sunday service has ended.

Bucky rolls into the parking lot, past the large sign with swirling lettering. Suddenly, things make more sense. Suddenly, you're struck with a sinking feeling of grief. Nostalgia. Mourning. But, happiness.

There are folks sitting outside, basking in the sun, tethered to walkers.

Bucky's wrists crank back weathered knuckles, and slowly the bike rumbles into an open spot. Extending his legs, Bucky balances the bike with ease. You take that as your cue to swing yourself off the back clumsily, hopping a bit. Bucky leans, kicks the stand down, and with significantly more grace than you, swings his leg over.

You're shrugging his jacket off when he speaks.

""He's going to be different than how you imagine him.""

You exhale slowly, draping the jacket over the bike's seat. You peel the helmet off.

""I've sort of pieced that together.""

You can see the slight discomfort hanging in his posture. You reach and touch Bucky's arm.

""Come on,"" you nod to the entrance, covered by a shady overhang where someone is helping a family member out of their car, ""We don't wanna be late, huh?""

His eyes soften. Bucky nods.

You walk side-by-side into the lobby of Elmwood Senior Living and it's like time slows down. It halts in a warm, sunshine-colored still -- full of chatter, full of humanity, full of wisdom. The room is framed by big windows, by plants, by a man in a U.S. Navy ball cap. He's stationed by the door, watching the comings and goings. The main desk, where a young woman watches, sits in the corner. You follow Bucky with a content little look. He notices.

He stands a little closer at the main desk. The girl, who looks like she's incredibly out of place with her blue hair and piercings, is younger than you thought. Highschool, maybe. She offers Bucky an excited smile.

""Took you long enough,"" she chirps, moving to sort through a bin to her side with key fobs.

Your brows raise. You spy calculus homework on the desk.

Bucky snorts. ""I'm here, aren't I?""

He notices the same problem set you so, and purposely leans over the desk. Suddenly, you're seeing flashes of a more boyish version of Bucky -- one that reminds you of a man with siblings. Bucky taps the paper, jutting a chin to the girl as she tries to swat his attention away.

""How'd you do on that test?""

""I got a 96,"" she chirps pridefully, laughing, ""Thanks for the help, nerd.""

You're watching the entire exchange with a smile, backing up a bit to toss a curious glance over your shoulder. There's a dining room through open doors -- and looks like lunch is just wrapping up. Folks are moving around, back to their rooms or upstairs where you can hear the beginnings of a seated aerobics class begin.

Bucky nudges you with his hand.

""Thanks, Sarah,"" he says and waves the key she'd handed over.

The girl with the blue hair scoffs. ""Say hi to grandpa for me, Bucket.""

You laugh out loud as Bucky quickly flips her off. She's quick to do the same.

You follow him around the corner, grinning ear to ear. He spares you a sheepish look, then rolls his eyes.

""What was that?""

""She's a good kid,"" he offers, eyeing the key with the grey little fob attached, ""Reminds me of my sister.""

Your face softens. ""Sister?""

""Her name was Sarah, too,"" he says quietly, boots landing softly on the blue carpet. He's navigating the residential wing like he's done it a million times. There are rooms with flowers outside, with holiday garb, with little photos and keepsakes. Each room holds a lifetime of personality -- the sound of Jeopardy lulls along in the background.

You hum. Bucky sighs.

He meanders down a long hallway where a different door is -- this one heavy and locked by the little keypad. Bucky raises the key fob to the device and the door buzzes.

This side of Elmwood is quieter.

Down the hall, Timmy Dorsey and Sinatra play quietly over someone's record player.

There aren't as many folks in the hall in this wing, but doors are open and nurses flit about. Around the corner, there's a loud conversation going on about lunch -- and you watch as Bucky weaves towards the nursing station. It's a room overlooking the common area with windows. Inside are three women.

One of them immediately jumps when she sees Bucky.

""Oh, good! I was meaning to talk to you--""

""Everything alright?""

""About the same,"" she breathes as she stands, moving to grab at a Bucky's arm with a sense of motherliness that makes you smile, ""But, meals have been a bit difficult lately.""

""No kidding,"" he mutters, rubbing his chin, ""He just doesn't wanna eat?""

""He thinks Peggy is coming home,"" the woman whispers with a pained smile as she begins to lead you both down the hall, ""He thinks your grandmother made dinner for him.""

""Right,"" Bucky nods, ""Doesn't wanna ruin his appetite.""

""Exactly.""

You take note of the conversation, muddling through your own confusion. You're quiet, though. This isn't really your conversation to have. Bucky seems to be relaxed more -- even humming slightly to a song that plays across the hall from the room the nurse is knocking on.

""Mr. Carter?"" she calls gently, ""Your grandson is here to see you, and his...""

She looks expectantly at you. You bawk.

""Friend.""

""Right,"" she smiles and pushes open the door.

It's like a little slice of home.

Sofas, chairs, photos on the walls. There's a record player in the corner, a television, a coffee table stacked with books on the second world war. There's a dresser covered in baubles and warm light coming in from the window overlooking the street. It reminds you of your grandparents' sitting room -- everything looks so lived in, so comfortable, so alive.

And then, below the light of the window, is a hospital bed.

In it is Steve Rogers.

Not the one you know -- no, this one has lived a full life. This Steve Rogers has fallen in love, owned a home, settled down. This Steve Rogers has years of wisdom settled into his face, years of well-fought fights in his joints. His blonde hair has gone shock white, but his smile is all the same.

""Bucky.""

The way Steve says his name is like the man beside you holds the world.

To Bucky, he can hear a new weakness. A new exhaustion.

""Hi, punk.""

The nurse offers a little wave to you as Bucky ventures into the room, stripping his jacket off and moving to scope out the minifridge in the small kitchenette beside the bathroom. She leaves the door open, and you smile to her softly. Bucky rummages, poking his head up.

""You want a drink, Steve?"" he asks, tone almost like he's feeling out the lucidity of the man across the room, ""There's some of that lemonade I brought last week in here.""

""Sounds good,"" he says slowly, ""Please.""

You feel out of place -- not unwelcome, but... it's clear that Bucky has come and gone from here a thousand times now. He knows to get the glasses out, to get a straw, to turn down the record player on his way over. Doris Day's voice lowers to a soft croon. You watch with heavy eyes.

""I brought someone, Steve,"" Bucky says, ""She's a big fan.""

""Oh?"" Steve asks with a slow look to the corner where you're standing, ""That musta broke your heart.""

Bucky snorts as he moves to swing the hospital bed's tray over Steve's lap. He places the lemonade down, then the other glass on the nightstand. He's quick to move the armchair closer to the nightstand, and gestures for you to come over. Bucky's hands guide you by the shoulders as he plops you into the chair.

""She's one of the good ones,"" Bucky says, ""Reminds me of you.""

""No kidding,"" Steve says slowly, offering a hand that shakes, ""Steve Rogers. It's a pleasure.""

You exchange your name with a shy look, shaking that hand with reverence and gentility. ""It's an honor, Mr. Rogers.""

""Please,"" he mumbles, moving to slowly take a sip of his lemonade, ""Steve is fine.""

Bucky moves to take up a post on the opposite side of Steve, in the sun. ""You're losin' weight, y'know.""

That earns him a wave of the hand.

Bucky leans back and sips his lemonade. He waggles a finger and you watch the two begin to go back and forth.

""No, no,"" he swallows, ""No, you don't get t' shrug me off--""

""M'fine, Buck,"" a sigh, ""Really.""

""Mhm,"" he narrows his eyes, ""You're startin' to look like the Steve I knew before the serum.""

You lean back, hiding a quiet smirk behind your hand.

""I was wondering when you were gonna show up an' pester me,"" he says with a tired look, ""The only peace I get around here is when Peggy comes home.""

Your eyes jump to Bucky. He's watching you.

""Peggy?"" you ask gently, ""Is that your wife?""

A proud smile washes over his face. ""Still knocks me for a loop, too.""

""Steve,"" Bucky's voice is gentle, ""Peggy won't be coming around for a while. Remember?""

There's a look that flashes across Steve's face, then. A mixture of sadness, of confusion, of panic. It's clouded with a furrow of his brow, hidden by a tilt of the head. He looks at Bucky, mouth pulled in a fine line.

When he finally speaks, his voice is sad.

""That's right. I forgot.""

""S'alright,"" Bucky taps his head, maintaining an air of nonchalance, ""That's why you got me.""

""And why you've got her, no doubt,"" he turns to you with a winning smile and offers his hand again, ""Steve Rogers. Nice to meet you.""

You take it, you shake it, and you introduce yourself once more. Your smile is patient and understanding. ""I've heard a lot about you, Steve.""

Bucky breathes a sigh of relief. Steve smiles, tossing Bucky a look that borders on mischievous.

He sips his lemonade and clears his throat. ""How is Sam?""

""You ask every time,"" Bucky mutters, ""And every time I have the same answer.""

""Sam?"" you ask slowly.

""Wilson,"" Bucky finishes, ""Bird man.""

""You mean Falcon,"" you correct, shooting him a stern look, ""The Falcon. Are you ghosting The Falcon?""

""I don't know what that even means, so maybe,"" Bucky leans back and crosses his legs, ""I've been busy.""

You roll your eyes. Steve saw. He smiles.

""I'm gettin' why he keeps you around.""

Your face is smacked with a look of pure joy.

""C'mon on now,"" Bucky cries, nearly indignantly, ""No flirting--""

""M' not flirting--""

""I know that look, Steve--""

Steve is laughing.

Bucky has a stern look in his eye. ""You always do this--""

""I'm not doin' a damn thing--""

""And you better keep it that way, old man,"" Bucky shirks, voice splintering into a laugh in a way that you've never heard before, ""I swear, this is how it always goes.""

""Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, huh, Buck?"" you ask gently, leaning your cheek into your hand.

Steve laughs loudly at that.

Bucky spares you a smile -- the sort that's drenched in good humor and sunlight. It makes your lungs flutter, and you ignore the buzz in your fingers at the sight. You hide your laugh into your cup of lemonade, resigning to be a quiet counterpart in the conversation.

The two of them go on to chat about small things, then chat about old things. From the Commandos, to HYDRA, to amends, to therapy, to Peggy, to the itch the starch of their old dress uniforms used to bring. It takes a bit, a few redirections on the way, but it's clear by the end why Steve Rogers is in Elmwood's memory unit.

It makes your heart ache.

And if a super soldier is bed-ridden...

The two of you say goodbye around three in the afternoon after Bucky helps Steve shave.

The walk back to the bike is quiet.

Bucky speaks first.

""He's dying.""

You chew your lip, eyes on the pavement. You match his slow stride, bumping your elbow with his as you walk. It's still warm, and the clouds hang high in the sky. When you look up, Bucky's watching you. You sigh.

""I'm sorry,"" you finally muster, ""I am.""

""Don't be,"" he says, grabbing the jacket from the seat and holding it up, ""He's lived a long life.""

You let Bucky hold out the arm for you, and you press your hand through the sleeve. He helps the other side on, and you zip it up to your chin. When you turn around to face him, there are tears in your eyes.

They snuck up on you. You hadn't realized it until Bucky's face fell, until the first one fell along the weathered leather of the jacket. You blink, raising your brows as you swipe them away, and offer an apologetic look.

""I'm happy,"" you say, ""Y'know. He has you. But, he's a man out of time. Even now. That makes me sad.""

Bucky's quiet for a while. He's leaned up against the bike as you turn and watch Elmwood from the back of the parking lot. There's a big part of you that feels heavy with guilt -- and though Steve was in good spirits when you left, you can't help but ache to provide him with more company. It's clear that seeing Bucky means a lot to him, and that in turn it means a lot to the man beside you.

""Come on,"" Bucky says then, ""Let's go home.""

You nod, let him muscle that helmet onto your head one more time, and hold on a little tighter back to the city.

 You don't see Bucky until Tuesday.

In all honesty, it feels weird to not hear from him for two days. At the very least, you expected some sort of phone call -- but you remind yourself that you've been okay alone for a long time. There's no need to throw all your work on being comfortable by yourself out the window for Bucky Barnes.

It's tempting, though. God, it's really tempting.

You hate the ache in your chest when you finally see him lumbering towards the cafe counter before your appointments. You hate this new feeling -- so you shove it down and ignore the way his fingers brush yours when he hands you your latte.

He is ignoring it, too. He's been ignoring it.

No use in thinking about it though.

""You got plans later?"" you ask him in the elevator after your appointment, tilting your head, ""Apparently there's a Lord of the Rings marathon tonight on FX.""

Bucky stiffens -- and immediately he can feel the hot sting of anxious regret flood his cheeks. He clears his throat, tucks his hands in his pockets, and toes the ground. You watch with a confused look. Then he speaks tightly.

""...I've got a date.""

You could have caught flies the way your jaw fell open.

""Oh. Oh!""

You blink, readjust your expression, and swallow down a sharp stab of rejection.

Bucky clears his throat. ""It's... I wasn't going to but, Dr. Raynor--""

""No, no,"" you wave your hands and shake your head and try to seem genuine, ""No, I'm happy for you. Is this one of those Christian Minglers?""

Bucky groans. ""Shut up.""

""Okay,"" you say, ""Okay! Just, uh, be careful. Y'know? And call if you need anything.""

The elevator doors open, and Bucky walks side by side with you through the well-lit lobby. He holds the door open for you, and you pass through with a pained look at the ground. He lingers, though, rubbing the back of his neck as you wait for him to say what's on his mind.

""Thursday,"" he says, ""I'll stop by.""

""Yea,"" you say, waving your hand, ""Whenever.""

But, that doesn't end up happening.

No, Bucky Barnes shows up at your apartment doorstep at 10pm.

He's clutching takeout and a six pack of beer and wearing a horrified expression that screams of guilt and exhaustion. No, Bucky buzzes the door to your apartment and basically croaks that he's here -- he's asking if the marathon is still on while you buzz him up.

""Third floor,"" you say into the buzzer with a smile, ""Come on in, old man.""

When you open the door, you have to laugh -- because his hair is a mess and there's still a trace of lipstick on the corner of his mouth. Whereas jealousy threatens to flare, his incredibly regretful expression tamps it down. You cock a hip, eye him up and down, and jut your chin out.

""Get laid?""

Bucky rolls his eyes so hard you're surprised he didn't break something.

He pushes past you, moving to drop the beer on the counter and place the takeout gently down by the basket of fruit.

""I'm here for the cat,"" he grumbles, ""Not your witty commentary, sweetheart.""

You're moving quietly to the sink and gathering a paper towel with a smirk as Bucky looks around, admiring the decor and aliveness of your apartment. When you turn around, he's already pried a beer from the pack and popped the top off with his vibranium palm.

He winces when you reach up to swipe the coral lipstick from the corner of his mouth.

Then Bucky settles, letting you clean off the mess.

""Mhm,"" you hum, ""Right. Was it at least fun?""

""She had fun,"" he mutters into his first sip, ""It was a lotta tongue for my first night out in nearly a century, though.""

You wince. He nods with a sardonic smile that tells you everything about how the date went down -- and you're relieved. ""So, I take it you're not calling her in the morning?""

""No,"" he shakes his head, ""Nope. No, and I've decided no more dates. That was enough for me.""

You wince and pluck a beer from the pack. Wordlessly, Bucky gestures for you to hand it over. In one smooth motion, he twists the cap off with his hand.

""That bad?"" you ask, eyeing him critically.

""I decided halfway through,"" he says as he moves to take the takeout from its bag, ""I'd rather be watching Lord of the Rings with you.""

That stops you into silence. It's like someone's taken your own words and gagged you with them -- and you're left floundering for breath you never even realize you lost. You know he means it. You know it because he won't look at you, because that sort of confession isn't easy for people like you two. So you take those words and you glue them in a lonely locket and keep them close to your heart.

Poke's entrance saves you a mouthful of broken words -- he comes in, trots up to Bucky, and hollers.

Bucky laughs.

""Nice to meet you, too,"" he mutters, eyeing the cat that's eagerly rubbing himself along Bucky's leg.

You wipe your face, sip you beer, and move to the pantry across from the kitchen island. You come back out with a bag of salmon treats -- the good ones -- and offer Bucky the bag. He takes it, eyes still on the calico, and crinkles it a little.

You lean against the counter and watch Bucky kneel.

""If you keep it up long enough he might even let you hold him.""

He lights up at that.

You laugh.

You move to grab plates and forks and knives and groan when you open up the first box to see Pad Thai -- you make a mental note to properly thank Bucky for this. You meager dinner of reheated pasta really hadn't hit the spot. This will, though. You can tell from the smell alone.

By your knees, Poke chirps.

""He's cute.""

""I never took you for a cat guy.""

Bucky snorts.

You make a plate and flick his head as you walk by. ""You're missing the start of The Two Towers.""

""I'm going to be confused, aren't I?"" he asks as he stands and begins making himself a plate. He watches as you settle onto the couch and sip your beer, ""I was too busy being turned into a cyborg to read the books.""

You laugh out loud. It shocks you.

""Was that a joke? Did Bucky Barnes just make a joke?""

He's smirking. He rounds the counter with his food and settles next to you. Poke is following him, eager to curl up next to his new friend.

""I can be funny.""

""Funny lookin'.""

He elbows you on purpose. You snort into your beer.

There's a comfortable moment of quiet between you, and you clear your throat.

""Thanks.""

""Yeah,"" he says slowly, ""No problem.""

More quiet, and he's still watching you. Then, he asks what's been on his mind for the last three days.

""You got a plan for Thursday?""

""I've got anxiety, Buck,"" you exhale, swigging your beer and turning the television up, ""I always have a plan.""

Visiting The Glass Cannon doesn't go as planned.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

You do have a plan.

Maybe it's a little vague, a little messy, and a little up-in-the-air, but it's a plan.

Get in, find Kiwi, avoid a handful of unsavory characters, and access the Alexandria Library.

Getting the hell out The Glass Cannon once you and Bucky were in was going to be a whole different plan entirely -- one that was more improv than anything else. Hopefully, running a quick facial recognition program wouldn't take long. With any luck, it would get a hit on any more recent aliases Innessa Sidrova was using after parsing the motherload of information Kiwi held onto with her life.

Kiwi wasn't always known as Kiwi. She worked at SHIELD, like you, and back then she was known as Suji Awal. She stuck around longer -- and she'd stayed on board during the active collapse to do heaven-sent work. It was an absolute Hail Mary, but while HYDRA had tried to purge all of SHIELD's cloud data to protect their active agents and decades of progress, Suji had beat the hare in the race. Two steps ahead, she'd managed to pull nearly 97% of all confidential data including mission reports, agent profiles, and even electronic correspondence. While the metaphorical fire burned the documents behind her, she'd managed to salvage one of the only surviving, comprehensive looks at SHIELD before the curtain was pulled back to reveal HYDRA's infection.

It had been used to try multiple HYDRA agents in the wake of it all in the federal courts. It was significant evidence, but after nearly all was reaped from the crop, Suji had taken the aptly named Alexandria Library and gone underground. Now, Kiwi was just another hacker in the thick of it and the Alexandria files were all but whispers.

It's all about knowing the right people in the end.

Kiwi was a regular at The Glass Cannon. There was a nine out of ten chance you'd find her there. And if you didn't find Kiwi, you'd probably find Climber and... Well, going to him wasn't the most ideal situation, but out of the menagerie of acquaintances you'd gathered up throughout the years, you could trust Climber. He'd send you Kiwi's way if you finally called in that favor he owed you. Either way, you'd find her and you'd get the files.

You just needed to avoid Alexei Gardzov.

Easy. Ish.

In truth, you barely get anything done Thursday -- you're too preoccupied in your head, running over the so-called plan even now as you fold laundry in the basement of your apartment complex.

You'd dug around in your closet, trying to find some semblance of an outfit. It was difficult. It wasn't like the barely-there dresses and platform shoes were your thing anymore. Back then, your diet was mostly energy drinks and alcohol -- in a way, it's a relief to find that a good number of your staple outfits no longer fit. It made you feel like you really had put all this behind you.

You have.

Sure, it was the Rabbit you were going to have to be for tonight, but you're not the Rabbit you were eight years ago. Good thing, too. You're not too sure you and Bucky would have gotten along otherwise. Right now, your relationship with him was the biggest thing keeping you afloat -- for the first time in a long time, you feel like you have some sort of purpose, even if it was a vague one at best.

You knew Innessa Sidrova was a threat -- and you knew Bucky had to remedy that threat. You knew he felt responsible for creating her, for planting her in a position of power where she could manipulate and control. In truth, there was still a lot of vagueness surrounding his past. He'd made it clear he hasn't been himself for a long time, but you couldn't bring yourself to wade through the muck of his trauma to pluck out your answers. It just felt wrong.

If you were to say you hadn't been tempted to go out on your own and dig, that'd be a lie.

Even now, as you pull out the ink-black top from the dryer and fold it neatly on top of the other pieces of laundry needed for tonight, you can feel it sparking like a lighter in the back of your head.

He was keeping something from you.

""Penny for your thoughts?""

You nearly jump six feet in the air.

It's Miss Bonnie -- and she's laughing when her feet touch the cold concrete of the unfinished floor. Her basket of laundry is balanced neatly on her hip, and she walks with a smirk on her face. Her hair is piled neatly on top of her head, and as she bends to plop the basket down, she offers a wink.

""I could hear you thinking from upstairs,"" she ruminates, paisley and dyed skirts kissing the ground, ""Like a little steam engine.""

You laugh quietly into your task. You duck your head and heft a black bra and jeans from the dryer. ""I've got a lot on my mind.""

She looks up, eyes moving carefully from the laundry pile to your face. Her eyes glimmer with quiet curiosity. ""And a big night planned, huh?""

You snort. ""What was the giveaway?""

""It's always the lacey bras,"" she chirps and slides a smirk your way as she waggles a finger at your pile, ""And the strappy little bodysuit was a good hint, too.""

You exhale with a laugh, bracing a hand against the dryer. She's not wrong -- you'd really forgone comfort with this outfit lineup. It was temporary, though, and well worth the efforts if it meant helping Bucky tick off a name from his list of amends. You knew how much those meant to him.

""So,"" she continues, voice muddled as she continues to load the washer, ""I take it this friend of yours is really helping you out of your shell?""

""I guess so. Yeah. It's -- It's sort of a mutual shell-cracking, I guess.""

""Mm,"" a hum, ""You sound troubled, though.""

Your mouth opens as your fingers trace the line of the bodysuit. You pause, and you rock back on your heels. Miss Bonnie notices.

She waits patiently, bent at the knees.

""You ever just..."" you wave your hand, ""Feel like -- I don't know. He's my friend. My best friend, honestly, and that's... Really saying a lot. But, there's stuff under the surface and I know it's not my business but...""

Out comes a strangled groan.

""What? Like a crazy ex-girlfriend?""

""No, no -- I don't think so,"" you mutter, ""Wouldn't surprise me, though.""

""Handsome?"" she asks, smiling.

You close your eyes and ignore the smile on your face as you reply. ""Yea, handsome.""

""Well, have you tried asking?"" she shrugs as she stands, ""Not about the crazy ex, but about the stuff you're worried about? It never hurts.""

""Problem is, I don't really think it's too much of my business.""

Miss Bonnie hums at that and presses the start on her washer. She's quiet for a bit, swaying slightly as she weighs the conversation and you watch -- enamored with the older woman's calm wisdom. She gestures openly with ringed hands.

""I think it's normal for us to want to know everything about those we care about,"" she says, ""We want to know how we can protect them, how we can comfort them. But... it comes in due time. All of it does. You'll find a time when he does open up about the ex, or whatever it is on his mind. You're friends, after all.""

You're nodding, chest tight with thanks.

Miss Bonnie's face is soft.

""You got a picture?"" she chirps like a bird looking for a worm, ""I wanna see who this little friend is. And if he really is as handsome as you're suggesting...""

You scoff and lean to dig out your phone.

""Cut it out,"" you mumble as she moves closer, ""No playing matchmaker.""

""Sure, sure,"" she waves, leaning to watch as you scroll through your camera roll.

The only photo you have of Bucky is there from Tuesday night -- after he'd housed nearly an entire container of noodles and promptly passed out during the third Lord of the Rings movie. You'd woken up around one in the morning to find that Poke had unceremoniously curled up on top of the supersoldier's chest. Bucky's hand was still in the calico's fur as he dozed, the colors of the TV painting his face all sorts of peaceful. You'd taken the photo, shoving it in his face after gently nudging him awake.

He's laughed.

You gesture to show Miss Bonnie.

Like ice, she freezes.

You notice a microexpression dart across her face, but it's gone in an instant. You can't pin it, but the way she bends to pull the phone closer and zoom in on her face comes off as interest. You blink, label it as shock, and move on.

Her voice sounds different.

""Handsome,"" she mumbles plainly, preoccupied with the sight, ""I get it now. What's his name?""

""Bucky,"" you say as she hands the phone back, ""He's... He's a good person.""

Miss Bonnie just nods.

You tuck your phone away and plop your laundry into your basket. Ignoring the sudden quiet that had crept between you both, you haul up the stack and offer her a gentle smile. She's fiddling with the washer's timer.

""Thank you, Miss Bonnie.""

""Of course,"" she rushes out, smiling gently, ""And be safe tonight.""

""I will.""

With your promise, you ascend the stairs.

In that basement, Bonnie McLayne is no more, and instead, Innessa Sidrova remembers that night in Moscow, back in 1975.

She remembers the Winter Soldier.

Bucky calls you three times with no answer.

Normally, he'd just give up -- but it was Thursday, and you weren't answering the buzzer to your apartment either. He tries his best to ignore the strike of panic that sparks in his chest. It could stoke a wildfire, really, but he pushes it down and remembers to breathe. He doesn't let himself think about what he'd do if something happened to you.

After all, you're probably fine. Sleeping, maybe. The both of you had a long night ahead.

(Longer than either of you realize, really.)

It's nearly seven o'clock, and after trying your cell one more time from his perch on your apartment's stoop, Bucky decides to say fuck it.

A well-adjusted person might frown upon what he was about to do, but Bucky wasn't exactly well-adjusted, now was he?

He rounds the back alley with long strides and easily finds that, with a little maneuvering, he can hoist himself upwards on top of the nearest dumpster. With a well-timed hop, he can also snag the bottom of the fire escape's ladder and haul it downwards. The rest is easy, and he's scaling the fire escape to the third floor with ease before he even knows it.

There's even a smug little smirk on his face the whole time he does.

Finding your window is a little harder, but Bucky eventually spots Poke's round little body smushed against the glass -- it's a dead giveaway, and after some prowling, he finds the window to your living room and unceremoniously throws it open.

It's unlocked, for whatever reason, and he makes a mental note to have a conversation with you about safety and security in the city. After all, you never knew when an ex-assassin supersoldier was going to break in and pet your cat.

Upon opening the window, he pieces together pretty quickly why you're not answering. Could be the music coming from your bedroom, or even the singing that's coupled alongside it. From the bathroom across the hall from your room, steam has settled above on the ceiling. The whole apartment smells like fruit and soap and perfume and Bucky's not really sure how to parse through all the sensory experiences that greet him with he shimmies in through the window, legs first.

All in all, they make him smile.

Bucky shuts the window behind him as he's quickly greeted by Poke -- the calico offers a gratuitous little chirp when Bucky bends to scoop up the cat. Easily, he melts. Poke is purring loudly in his ear as Bucky takes a moment to survey your apartment a little bit closer. Mr. Poke Bowl rubs his face against Bucky's stubble as the man weaves through the kitchen.

It's very you.

He isn't really sure what that means at the end of the day, but all he knows is that he feels at home here. He feels safe. He feels comfortable. He feels like he can be himself. Not James, not Sergeant Barnes, not The Winter Soldier. Not even Steve's Bucky, but just... his Bucky. Himself. Sarcastic and exhausted and a little cynical.

Bucky lets Poke down on the counter and moves to the fridge.

There's still beer from the other night in there, tucked in the back, so he makes easy work on popping open a bottle and busying himself with petting a very adamant Poke.

As he sips the Leinenkugel, it's no small coincidence that his phone buzzes again -- for what feels like the hundredth time today -- with a message from Janelle.

She was nice -- pretty, too. Once upon a time, she would have been his type.

That was before he met you, though.

There's a little pinprick of mortification at that quiet confession that's been slipping into his heart more and more in the last few days. You are, after all, his best friend. He's your best friend. Guilt swims with the feelings that have begun to pluck his heartstrings and he has to admit he's not too comfortable with the song they play.

His biggest fear is fucking this up.

Fucking you up.

Honestly, his track record isn't great. The whole defrosted-international-threat bit made it a little difficult to date. Janelle seemed to think the date had gone well enough, though, hence the handful of texts he'd been getting every few hours asking if he's free.

Like usual, he ignores them.

Exercising his own free will is hard sometimes. Especially when it comes to saying no.

Taking another swig of the beer, Bucky shoves his phone back into his pocket and tucks his fingers back into Poke's fur. The calico's tail swings patiently as he sits and watches -- and it's a little weird how human his eyes are for a second there. He mmrrps and lunges for Bucky's hand when he comes close, bonking his head eagerly against the cool vibranium.

It's a different sensation.

That's another big adjustment -- learning how things really feel with this new arm. It's not just handling recoil or gripping knives or throwing punches. It's the soft tickle of fur, the gentle pressure of a warm rag to clean the joints. Meticulous upkeep wasn't something HYDRA did often. He doesn't miss the twinge of pain and molasses-like stickiness that came with a dirty arm. Blood was the worst. Always sat deep in the cracks.

He flexes his fingers. Poke meows again.

He moves to plop down on the couch. Poke follows.

You're singing, still, to some song that Bucky's never heard, when you push open your bedroom door and move towards the living room.

You jump six feet in the air and scream when you see him just sitting there, clutching a beer and petting Poke like he fucking lives here rent-free.

Bucky's reaction is muted, mostly because he's a little too preoccupied with your outfit and your jewelry and the pink eye shadow that creeps up your brow-bone. There's glitter on your eyelids and lip gloss on your mouth and he can smell some sort of candy-sweet perfume coming off you. The plunging neckline of the jet-black top is enough to leave him shifting his gaze back up to your startled expression with a tight jaw.

His face is blank.

Then he offers that stupid fucking smile he does. Y'know, the tight-lipped one where he somehow maintains a dead-eyed look the whole time. If you weren't trying to calm your racing heartbeat, you might have laughed. You hate the white-hot flare it sparks in your chest.

""How the fuck did you get in here?"" you hiss, waving your hands.

""We need to have a serious conversation about locking our windows,"" he says as he kicks his feet up on the coffee table and wags a finger at you, ""Also, what are you wearing?""

""You -- You fucking broke in through my window?""

""Yea, well, you were too busy pretending to be Britney Spears to hear me try and buzz up, and my phone calls.""

Sheepishly, you cross your arms. ""Nice reference--""

A shrug from Bucky. ""Thank you.""

""--Also, what are you wearing?""

He looks down at his usual t-shirt, leather jacket combo. He squints back up at you.

""I'm sorry,"" he chirps, ""You're talking to me? Did the department store run out of fabric, Rabbit?""

You self-consciously adjust the plunging neckline of the bodysuit as you frown deeply. ""I think I'm gonna skip on the fashion advice from the man who lived in a time where ankles were seen as scandalous.""

""I was born in 1917,"" he mumbles as he stands, actively avoiding another pass over your outfit because as much as he hates to admit it, it's not a bad look on you, ""Not 1817.""

""Point being, we're going to a club. And you look like you're going to the local Home Depot,"" you move to snag a set of dangly earrings that are sitting on the coffee table, ""We've gotta look like we're there to party, nothing more.""

Bucky sighs. He finishes the beer, places the bottle down and sheds his jacket. ""So, what?""

You pry your eyes away from the flash of skin -- his arm, flesh and blood, speaks to how strong he is. And, undoubtedly how easy it was for him to fucking scale three stories of the fire escape to bust in.

""So,"" you mumble as you thread the earring in, ""I have some of Jaimie's old shirts. There's probably something you can use... If they fit.""

Bucky exhales softly. ""You kept them?""

""Didn't have the heart to throw them out,"" you reply as you gesture for him to follow you into your bedroom.

The back of your top is arguably more crisis-inducing than the front -- it's an open back, and Bucky settles on admiring the decor rather than the curve of your spine. He has to. For his own fucking self-composure.

Your bedroom is nice -- and like the rest of your space, it makes him feel comfortable. It's all warm colors and posters and plants in the corners. Across from your queen-sized bed, there's a large desk with a triple monitor setup. That's where the music is coming from. The little knick-knacks on your shelves and desk make him chuckle.

Then, he stops, halfway to the closet, and stares.

You blink over your shoulder as you bend, digging to the back of your closet to pull out the clear bin you'd piled most of Jaimie's stuff into after the funeral. After you'd cleaned out his apartment on your own.

He's looking at the poster -- the one from Cap's USO tour. It's framed nicely, set up on the wall beside your desk. It's got a gold frame, and Bucky can't help but wander closer to look at the signature.

It's Steve's alright.

""How much did you pay for this?""

You scoff. Your necklaces tinker together. ""Don't even go there.""

""The jerk signed thousands of these,"" he mumbles, crossing his arms as he leans closer, ""And still, the fame didn't go to his head.""

You smile softly, leaning back.

""Jealous?"" you chirp, raising your brows as you pretend to swoon, ""Oh, Sergeant Barnes, I'd just love to meet your dear friend --""

Bucky's laughing as you swat at his knee, leaning back on the carpet like a damsel in distress.

""Shut up,"" he snorts, ""It's a sore subject for me.""

""Oh my god.""

""I'm serious -- do you know how many dates I had to set up for the chump? And then, boom. I'm invisible.""

""Yeah, well,"" you mutter with a smile, unclicking the lid, ""Some people just like blondes, Buck. I'm sure there were plenty of eyes on you. Stop being so dramatic.""

""Yea, the best friend, sure,"" he mumbles at the poster, ""Hell, he was taller than me. You know you don't need to lie to me--""

""Listen, if I was some Lauren Bacall-looking nurse back then,"" you wave your hands, ""I'd have gone for you. Alright? Stop lamenting and get over here.""

He goes quiet and ignores the warmth in his cheeks. He squats by your side. ""Shut up.""

""We seriously need to work on taking compliments,"" you groan, throwing your head back, ""I'm being serious, y'know, for once. And I'm not just saying it as your friend. You're handsome and everyone knows it except you, apparently. My neighbor agrees that's for sure.""

He squints.

You wave it off and gesture to your outfit. ""She saw me doing laundry.""

""That explains nothing,"" Bucky deadpans, ""Literally nothing.""

""I showed her a picture,"" you cry indignantly, moving to shuffle through some of the old t-shirts sitting on top of the bin, ""Relax.""

He moves to plop down, crossing his legs beneath him. He decides to let the topic die -- again, for his own self-composure more than anything. The compliment, though vehemently denied by the worst part of him, is tucked neatly in the homes of his heart. The idea of meeting you, before now, is a little intoxicating. What would it have been like?

Would you have even spared him a dance?

Bucky rubs his cheek. Poke meows and buts the door open with his head.

You're wrist-deep in the bin when you speak. ""He's obsessed with you, y'know.""

Poke has already taken up a post in Bucky's lap. Bucky smiles, petting Poke gently with his vibranium hand. The cat seems to like the cool metal. Bucky mumbles softly down to the calico, scritching his cheeks. ""I like him, too.""

You pause long enough to try and remember the sight.

Bucky's eyes find yours, and you're quick to turn back to the bin.

""Here we go,"" you exhale as you pull out the shirt you'd been looking for.

It's a long-sleeve button-down, one that you can distinctly remember Jaimie wearing to his engagement party's after-party -- a real typical night of Jaimie being Jaimie. It's black with a barely-there red floral pattern. It's flashy enough that Bucky won't look horribly out of place.

The only problem is Jaimie was a little smaller than Bucky.

""Try this on,"" you mumble as you dig around trying to find something else in case it doesn't do the trick.

Bucky catches the silk shirt and gives it a once over. He raises an eyebrow, and deciding against debating this, he simply nudges Poke off his lap and stands.

He moves to your bed, laying the shirt out. On your closet door is a full-length mirror. You want to snap it in half when you accidentally catch a glimpse of Bucky hauling off his black, cotton t-shirt and anxiously fumbling with the buttons on Jaimie's old shirt. You have to breathe -- and remind yourself that that's Bucky.

Your Bucky. Your best friend Bucky.

When he calls your name, it sounds far away. You're busy angrily sorting through old clothes.

""I look ridiculous.""

When you turn around, the first thing you notice is that it's a little tight. Not in a bad way, but the buttons are gapping along his chest, and it's tight around his arms.

Your eyes widen a little and you swallow. You tilt your head.

Bucky's frowning.

""Let me see,"" you offer gently, standing and moving close, ""It's not that bad.""

""You don't sound too sure right now,"" he mumbles as you enter his personal space.

You're nimble with undoing the top three buttons -- it gives him enough room to move his shoulders, though, and the dip of the shirt along his sternum brings dog tags into view. You reach, momentarily entranced, and read them to yourself.

You smell like vanilla and sugar.

Bucky shifts in his boots.

""Y'know,"" you say, moving to the sleeves, ""I think this works.""

You roll the sleeves, stopping at his forearm.

When you step aside, Bucky can see himself in the full-length mirror. He looks less than enthused.

It's not an entirely bad look -- he'll admit that much -- but he doesn't look like himself. No, there's too much chest and skin and... Christ, this shirt is tight. He does, though, look like some of those trendy folks he sees at Izzy's bar every now and again. Hipsters.

""I look like a douchebag.""

""That's the point,"" you chirp as you close the box and shove it back into your closet, ""Now the outfit matches the personality.""

He swats at your head on the way by. You laugh.

You've got boots in your hand, and you land on the bed with a bounce. Bucky is busy fixing his hair in the mirror while you zip up the thigh-high boots. When he turns around, you're about three inches taller. He blinks, yet again entranced by the outfit.

Then, you're muscling on the jacket.

It's neon pink -- and shaggy and cropped. It falls just above your waist and swallows you whole. But, Bucky's attention is mostly on the back.

There's a large, white embroidered Playboy bunny there, with RABBIT written across the shoulders in a chunky, blackletter typeface.

His brows are high on his face when you turn around.

You freeze.

""...What?"" you ask, ""Something on my face?""

""Playboy bunny, huh?""

You could smack him. ""Weren't you busy being a frozen dinner when Playboy came out?""

""I'll have you know,"" he says tightly as he follows you out of your bedroom and to the living room, ""The Russians enjoyed their fair share of editions.""

""The Russians? Sure, what's that saying? There's no sex in the USSR?"" you chide, ""You can just say Bucky Barnes enjoyed his fair share--""

The tips of his ears are red. You notice. It makes you split into a grin that worsens the pink shade that's crawling up his neck.

He coughs. ""Have you ever considered never opening your mouth again, Rabbit?""

You nudge his arm. ""Nah. Bothering you is more fun.""

He shrugs on his jacket, sighs, and decides that keeping quiet is just easier.

However, that's not entirely your plan -- and you speak quickly as you pull your purse over your shoulder. You're rummaging quietly, stacking your wallet and phone inside. You glance up at him.

""You ready?""

""As I'll ever be,"" he mumbles, bending to pat Poke one last time as you move to the door of your bedroom. He watches you flick all the lights off, and before you leave, you double check the calico's food and water. He's got enough for a few days. Bucky leans against the door frame, ""Care to run me through the plan?""

Nodding, you move to open your front door.

""It'll be easy,"" you explain as you make room for him, ""If we play our cards right--""

Bucky's stopped, though, and is digging in his back pocket as his cell phone rings. You watch him exhale tightly, eyes on the screen the entire time he squeezes by you and starts down the hall. You make careful note of the delicate scowl on his face, only before you catch Miss Bonnie out of the corner of her eye.

Her door is half-cracked across the hall, and she's watching.

She offers you a smile.

Bucky keeps walking.

You wave, lock your door, and jog to catch up to Bucky.

""Hey,"" you call, ""Earth to Mr. Claw Machine?""

His head snaps up. ""Sorry.""

""Who was that?"" you ask carefully, nudging his arm with yours, ""Falcon?""

""I wish,"" he mutters as he muscles the cellphone back into his pocket, ""I wouldn't feel so bad sending him to voicemail.""

""Yeesh,"" you wince, ""Lemme guess, was it the owner of the coral lipstick that was all over your face on Tuesday night?""

Again, that temptation to feel jealousy flares up in your heart. But, he's here, isn't he? With you. Ignoring her calls. And probably texts judging by the guilty look that's on his face. You feel a little bad -- but at the same time, Bucky's a grown man. Maybe a grown man who needs to create some more transparent lines of communication with the poor woman, but still.

""Bingo. I mean -- it's not that she wasn't great an' all but...""

You raise both hands. ""I'm not judging.""

He sighs raggedly as he bounces down the apartment's stairs. ""I don't think I'm ready for that.""

""What?"" you ask with a laugh, ""Dating? Yea, it's pretty fucking terrifying, Buck.""

""You sound like you're speaking from experience.""

You hold the door open for him and slide him a pitying look.

""Because I am.""

The walk to The Glass Cannon is spent walking Bucky through the plan -- and for the most part, he makes a point of nodding along and listening. His only real anxiety pops up at the mention of Alexei, which is relatable to say the least.

It's dark, the streets are relatively quiet, and the spring chill has pricked your skin. Your heels click against the pavement, and you stalk along. Shoving your hands in your pockets of the pink, shag jacket, you huff.

You're starting to feel the anxiety.

Fifteen minutes later, you're both approaching the blue glow of the storefront.

Computers & Stuff was a family-owned and operated computer shop from the 90s that was taken over by a lesser-known hand of the Russian crime family in New York, the Gardzovs. Alexei's father is the formal owner of the shop, and his son runs the lucrative activities of the underground club that lay beneath the graphics cards and motherboards.

Bucky, as you both near the entrance, speaks quickly. ""Anything else I need to know?""

""Just follow my lead, okay?"" you whisper.

The bell above the door dings when you pull open the glass door.

The lighting is sterile and if you're real quiet, you can hear the dull hum of the fluorescents. The store is empty, save for one man behind the register.

You almost duck out the entrance at the sight of him.

Igor has been a bouncer at The Glass Cannon for as long as you've been a patron -- and he's also one of Alexei's dogs. This part of the plan was something you'd considered only briefly, and for a second, you're thankful you worried over the million and ten ways this would play out for days.

""Well, if it isn't the little bunny.""

It's said with malice. Igor's tattooed hands land on the counter as he leans.

You, however, hold your head high. Bucky watches as something changes in your posture.

""Good to see you, Igor.""

""Is it?"" he growls, stalking around the counter and quickly encroaching on your personal space, ""Because I'm pretty sure you're not welcome here, bunny.""

Bucky gets a good look at the man now -- clearly an enforcer. He's got prison tattoos, a shaved head. The long beard is a weak spot. Doesn't seem to be armed. Blue eyes flick to you and the way you don't even flinch when the man leans to breathe right in your face.

You just smile.

""I thought you'd say that,"" you mumble, moving to swing your bag to the front and dig your wallet out, ""But, I'm not here to cause any trouble.""

Suddenly, there's a hundred-dollar bill slipping from your well-manicured nails into the vest pocket of the bouncer. There's a tense pause, then, while the two of you size one another up.

""Fucking your way through college paid off, huh?"" he hisses.

You stay quiet.

Bucky, though, moves between you both with a quick shove. Immediately, Igor's attention goes to Bucky as he sizes him up -- he laughs. His nose is nearly touching Bucky's.

""What's wrong, pretty boy?""

""You should watch your mouth,"" Bucky says evenly, ""Or I'll fucking cut your tongue out.""

You're careful to hide your expression; the feeling the words stir isn't one that you're happy about. This sudden protectiveness, though, makes you feel some sort of invincible.

Igor settles back on his heels.

He steps back.

He gestures to the back room with his head.

You keep walking when he calls out: ""Careful, bunny, the dogs are going to be looking for you.""

You grit your teeth tightly and push through the fabric curtain.

He barks, taunting you.

Bucky is by your side in an instant, gaze still rooted over his shoulder at the hulking bouncer. He waits until you've settled down until you've said his name. His eyes fall to you, then to the stairwell before them.

Above it, in curled neon tubing, reads The Glass Cannon.

The windows are blacked out, but from his spot at the top of the stairs, Bucky can feel the rattle of a deep bass vibrate his ribs.

""Come on. We're on a time crunch now.""

""Alexei?""

You nod as you lead the way down the stairs. ""Word travels fast. We need to be quicker. Stick to the crowds. Remember, we just need to find Kiwi -- then we bail.""

Bucky nods tensely.

Then, you open the doors.

Immediately, his eyes adjust to the darkness -- neon and strobes and the pulse of purple and pink LEDs make his vision swim. It's warmer down here, and the stairs leading down into the sub-basement is lined with people sipping drinks and chattering over the loud music. It smells like piss and beer and tobacco.

Again, Bucky watches as the person he knows melts away.

The Rabbit in front of him is different.

You reach, as if on reflex, for his hand.

When you turn around and flash him a smile, he has to swallow down a sudden rise of sheepishness.  

The sea of people part around you, and Bucky realizes quickly that people recognize you. He can see their painted lips moving, muttering things into curious ears about the pink-clad woman in front of him; there are smiles there and frowns, and shock. You're slow in your descent, making a show of the arrival -- all while Bucky begins to piece together that The Glass Cannon is larger than he originally suspected.

As they near the bottom of the landing, he can see out across the floor.

There's a square-shaped catwalk around the dance floor, laden with dancers on their designated poles. Tables line the outside of the cavernous room, and the bars along each wall are crowded -- even still, these glimpses of his surroundings come in temporary flashes of light. The music coming from the center of the dancefloor is loud. The entirety of the scene is raucous.

He can't imagine you finding solace here.

He tightens his grip on your hand. You squeeze back.

When both of you reach the bottom of the stairwell, the sea of people swallow you in a current of dancing and drinking and laughing, and you crawl into Bucky's personal space to shout in his ear.

You're still holding his hand tightly, pressed to his chest, as you lean upwards to brush your cheek with his.

""Follow me, okay?""

He nods.

You begin the methodical crawl through the dancefloor, working your way to the bar -- there, you pause long enough to be served a drink that's as pink as the glitter on your eyelids. The flecks dance in the lights, and Bucky graciously accepts a shot from the bartender who smiles sweetly like honey at you.

You bat your lashes, thank her, and stand gracefully from the barstool.

You take a pointed swig and scan the floor.

Kiwi would be in one of the private booths, you suspect -- she was enough of a high roller here. But, with the crowded club bursting at the seams, it was nearly impossible to get to the other side. You sway a bit on your feet, still tightly gripping Bucky's hand in your own. You refuse to let go.

For your sake and his.

Bucky is a silent shadow, eyes roaming the club -- he watches a dancer dip down low and snag a green bill from a patron. Someone beside him laughs loud, another bumping into his backside as you continue to weave to the outer rim of the room. The music is so loud his heartbeat could be mistaken for an 808, and he feels the thrum in his bones.

If he wasn't so overwhelmed, if he was drunk, maybe it could be fun.

Finally, out of the haze of bodies, Bucky can breathe.

You're leaning over again, speaking quickly.

""I don't see her.""

""I can't see shit in here,"" he calls back, eyes moving along the ridge of the room. He scans the booths set into the walls, set up on platforms, and roped off with velveteen, ""Where would she be?""

""Hard to tell,"" you mumble, ""But I think I might need to go to Plan B.""

Bucky follows your solid stare.

In the booth directly across the floor from you, there's a man in black -- black everything, save from his hair. That's the brightest blue Bucky has ever seen. He's swallowed by a harem of men and women who are laughing and drinking and dancing, and he's entertaining. Ringed fingers wave in the air, face split into a laugh so wide he swears it's a mile long. He's got glasses on and they're tinted blue.

Bucky watches carefully as you move to his booth.

It's like a prey surveying a trap -- you're careful.

Finally, when you stand before it, you let go of his hand.

""Hi there, Climber.""

The whole booth falls silent. The man stiffens, back turned to you totally. Bucky watches as his hands fall and slowly, the man you'd called Climber turns around.

His expression is stone cold.

His voice, however, is as warm as a hot poker.

""Oh my goodness, is that Rabbit?""

He ascends from the booth, platform boots leaving him to tower over you -- he's no small man, either. Bucky watches as he bends to kiss both of your cheeks and hug you tightly. He, however, doesn't pull away entirely.

""What the fuck are you doing here,"" he hisses, ""You want to be roadkill?""

""I need to find Kiwi,"" you whisper quickly, expression almost begging, ""Please.""

He pauses, dimpled chin wavering a bit. Bucky watches him sniff, push his glasses back, and readjust his posture. Climber licks his lips and his eyes dart to Bucky. He's thinking, Bucky realizes, and after a quick moment of deliberation, he seems to cave.

""Only because I owe you.""

""I know,"" you say, raising your hands, ""I know.""

In a dash, his demeanor changes once more. He's flying over to his harem, waving his hands and blowing kisses and promising he'll be back in a flash. They whine, they moan, but Climber appeases them with another round of jello shots from strobing syringes that a waitress is carrying by.

""Come on then,"" he says, ""And stop looking like such a prude.""

He begins to weave.

You follow hand returning to its spot in Bucky's like a lifeline.

You're sipping your drink, moving through the crowd easily. There's a slight sway in your step now, and at one point you and Climber even get noticed by a pod of people who recognize your faces. It's met with laughing and squealing and in the fray, the both of you slip back into the crowd. Bucky is taking it all in, desperately ignoring the tingle of a panic flaring in the back of his head.


Too many people.


Soon, though, Climber is moving towards a side entrance.

It's a back room.

Suddenly, the dim lights and neon dissolve, and instead, Bucky is flashed in the face with the abrasive sting of fluorescent lights. It no longer reeks of spilled beer, and his boots don't stick to the ground. No, there's quiet chatter back here -- Climber continues to lead the two of you through a maze of supply crates full of booze and soda.

Then, a right turn. And a left turn.

Someone is taking inventory.

""Kiwi, I know you're going to hate me for this--""

The woman who turns around is beautiful. She's in the midst of eyeing an open crate that looks just like the others but fitted with a hollowed center, marking off what looks like an inventory of burner cell phones. Her brown skin is decorated with glitter, her eyes streaked with the same green shade of her tightly shaved head. The green is bright and it reminds Bucky of summer.

Suddenly, her expression sours.

""What the fuck.""

""I know--""

""No,"" she snaps, raising her hand and waving to the assistant beside her to take her tablet and make themselves scarce, ""You need to get out of here.""

""I need your help,"" you say finally, tone heavy.

It's enough to make Climber sigh. Kiwi watches you, scratches her neck, and swallows.

She meets Climber's eyes.

Then she breaks.

""Where the fuck have you been, Rabbit?"" she asks, worries seeping into her eyes as she pulls you into a rough hug, ""We thought you were dead.""

""No,"" you shake your head, ""But you know I couldn't be around here anymore.""

""Yea,"" Climber snorts, ""Not good for your health, huh, love?""

""Alexei still wants your head,"" Kiwi chimes in, crossing her arms, ""Does he know you're here?""

""Igor was on the door, so I'm sure he's heard by now.""

Both of them curse.

Guilt flashes across your face as you screw your eyes shut and nod. ""I know. I know, I just... I seriously need your help, Kiwi. It was worth the risk. It's -- HYDRA. I need to tap into the Alexandria Library.""

Immediately, the woman stiffens.

Her eyes flash to Bucky in the corner. He stares back.

""He waits outside.""

""You can trust him--""

""No,"" she snaps, ""I can't. And I don't. And I won't.""

You give Bucky a pleading look. Between the two of you, a negotiation happens between your eyes. It's a compromise, and finally, Bucky relents.

""Fine,"" Bucky barks, tilting his head and giving you a tight-lipped smile, ""Fine. I'll wait out here.""

""He's cute,"" mumbles Climber as Bucky rounds the corner, long legs carrying him out of the supply room, ""Boyfriend?""

""Shut up, Climber,"" you mumble, waving your hand, ""Just listen--""

""Who is he?"" Kiwi asks, eyes still watching the doorway, ""And why did you bring him along?""

You sigh, rubbing your brow. ""He's the one who's trying to find this HYDRA agent. He knew her before.""

""So he's HYDRA.""

""No,"" you snap cooly, ""He's not.""

""So, just handsome, then?"" Climber asks, hands waving, ""Right. Great. Really making a case for yourself, Rabbit.""

""He's trying to find a woman named Innessa Sidrova. She was one of the original agents who helped form the American HYDRA cell,"" you explain quickly, ""I've got the GRC breathing down my neck, and... And he's a good person. He's my friend. I'm trying to help him, but I can't do it without you. Both of you.""

Kiwi hums. She sighs. ""That explains why you went MIA.""

""Aside from putting Alexei behind bars?"" you scoff, ""Yea, the GRC played a part in it.""

The three of you are quiet for a moment.

""Fine.""

You look up at Kiwi. Her hands are on her waist.

There's an immense wash of relief that floods over you at that moment -- and from the looks of it, Kiwi can tell. You move to grab her hand, and she grabs back. Both of you smile, and the hug that follows is warm. You've missed her. A lot.

""Thank you, Suji.""

Then, footsteps.

That relief is traded in for an anxious backfire of fear in an instant.

It's slow. Dress shoes on polished cement.

Then:

""Oh, bunny, bunny, bunny. Tsk, tsk.""

Climber and Kiwi's faces upturn to the doorway and they tell you everything you need to know.

So, you decide at that moment that you won't be the prey tonight.

You turn around and come face-to-face with a man playing devil.

Alexei Gardzov is a handsome man -- a beard and piercing grey eyes. His hair is tightly cropped, and intricate tattoos decorate every inch of his skin. Some of them are new, you realize, and there's temporary pride that bubbles up at them. They're from prison.

You almost smile.

Behind him, three goons loom.

""I've been wondering when you'd come hopping back,"" he croons as he enters the room with the swagger of a man who trapped his dinner, ""Well worth the wait, I think.""

His cologne hangs like smog in the air. He strolls up to you, and in a flash, he's got your hair in a vice grip.

He yanks it back, you grit your teeth.

The barrel of a gun digs into your cheek.

""Climber, Kiwi, and Rabbit,"" he sing-songs, ""All in one room again like it's NYU's 2014 hack-a-thon. Isn't that cute?""

Kiwi speaks. ""Alexei--""

""Shut up,"" he snaps, gun moving to flash towards Kiwi, ""And stay out of my business, Sujina.""

The gun's muzzle is cold. He's rough, and you try to ignore the twinge of pain that comes with his unceremonious yank of your hair. Once more, he tsks. His breath is hot on your face. He smells like cigarettes and whiskey.

""I spent seven years behind bars,"" he bites, ""All because a' you.""

""Me? I wasn't the one trafficking girls--""


""SHUT UP!""


The pistol cracks across your cheek and the cement floor hurtles towards you. The gasp that falls from your lips is from shock; your fingers dig into the cold ground as you try to blink away the blurriness. Your ears ring. Blood drips from your cheek between your fingers.

Again, there's a hand in your hair.

Now, the fight begins.

Climber and Kiwi are stuck, frozen in fear.

You don't blame them, because Igor and the others have guns already drawn. One of them, one that's young and you don't recognize immediately, has a baseball bat in his hands.

Alexei drags you by your hair as you grimace, refusing to scream. Your heels scrape against the ground as you try to get purchase, but he's quick to throw you back against the far wall.

""Don't worry, Bunny,"" he smiles, ""I won't kill you. Not right now.""

Then, a kick.

Right to the ribs.

You can't breathe -- you gasp earnestly at the white, hot shot of pain.

""Get up.""

You're not listening, you're too busy trying to catch your breath.

""I said,"" comes a growl as he reaches, hand in your hair again as he drags you up the wall. Your legs buckle, and you try to hold your chin high as you stumble upwards, ""Get up.""

Then, there's a hand around your throat.

Tight. Too tight. Can't breathe. Can't breathe. Can't breathe. Can't get his hand off your neck, can't breathe, can't breathe, can't fucking think, can't stand, can't see, can't breathe --


""Boss!""


A new voice.

The pressure is relieved for a second.

A new face has run into the room -- he looks frazzled, hair askew and gun out. He's eyeing the scene before him in a moment's pause.

""Can't you see I'm a little bit busy?"" Alexei snags as you gasp, clawing at his hand. He swings his head to the figure in the doorway with an annoyed bark, ""What is it?""

""The cops, boss,"" he stammers, ""They're here.""

""What?""

""They're here for her, boss.""

A slow turn to where his finger is pointing. His gaze lands on you. Alexei laughs.

""Well,"" he says as the goon disappears, ""Isn't that just peachy, bunny?""

The choking starts again.

Then, a metal hand.

Vibranium.

You watch it swing, you watch it grab Alexei's throat.

Suddenly, you can breathe.

Suddenly, Bucky Barnes enters the fight.

You make friends with the ground again as you duck, just as Alexei is rammed into the wall above your head by his throat. As you cough while Kiwi calls your name -- you can hear a fight. But everything's moving slow, and it's not until the first gunshot that you're kicked into action. It's loud. Your skin pricks alive.

Someone screams.

You stumble to your feet, eyes finding Bucky's form moving quickly between the three goons -- the gunshot had come from the pistol that had somehow found its way into Bucky's flesh and blood hand. One of the men is on the floor, suit pants stained with a bullet wound through the thigh. He's wailing. Bucky doesn't notice. Or he doesn't care. Maybe both.

His face is cold.

Another gunshot is fired off, this time richoting between you and Kiwi and Climber and embedding itself into the cement wall overhead. The three of you scream, ducking reflexively.

That's when Bucky snaps.


""Now would be a good time to go!""


Kiwi's hands are on your arm as you quickly break through the doorway through the storage room. Climber is following, checking over his shoulder at the carnage that Bucky begins to reap in the room.

He's hysterical, trying to jog in his white platform boots. ""What the fuck, Rabbit!""

Your voice is hoarse. You're clutching your ribs. ""Not now, Climber!""

""I'm parked in the back,"" Kiwi says, ducking through plastic flaps as she helps you through the back of the club, ""Come on, we'll go through the trucking entrance.""

You hear Bucky call your name -- he's jogging to catch up, gun drawn in his hand. Seems like he made good work of the others, sporting nothing more than a split lip. You turn, pausing for a moment to take inventory of his well-being.

And that's all it takes.

Alexei Gardzov, limping, steps in front of you and Kiwi and Climber at an intersection in the hallway.

There's a gun in his hand.

The first thing you feel is the impact.

Like a truck slamming into you at full speed. For the fourth time tonight, you have the air robbed from your lungs. It's instant confusion.

Then comes the pain. Hot. Hotter than the sun. Hot like white flames. It tears through your shoulder and all you can do is gasp; you're sent into a stutter step -- and while the world around you continues to move, you're busy reconciling with the fact you've just been shot.

A bullet flies by your head.

Alexei Gardzov drops.

You're grasping at your chest, staggering, when Bucky breaks into a sprint -- but you're okay. You're okay, it's just your shoulder, it's just your arm, you're okay, you can feel your fingers and you can breathe and the pain is nearly unbearable but you're okay.

Then, a baseball bat.

It clocks Bucky directly in the skull. He's clotheslined.

It's Igor.

The gun from Bucky's hands clatters across the ground to your feet, and you're too busy trying to get to Bucky to realize -- but, you've got tunnel vision and adrenaline and at that moment, you think a good sidekick doesn't need anything else in this life.

Igor goes to swing at you, but you duck. Your stiletto crushes through the top of his shoe. He screams and in a flurry of pain and panic, you manage to snag the bat quick enough to turn and clock him under the chin with a roll of the wrist.

His teeth clack together and he falls backward, unconscious.

""God, I really wish you could have seen that, Buck.""

You spit. Blood paints the ground.

The bat clatters to the cement as you fight through the pain. Kiwi and Climber are by your side in an instant.

""No, no!"" she screams, ""We do not have time for this--""

""I am not leaving him,"" you snap, nearly screaming at the woman, ""Come on and help me with him. Now.""

After a sigh of resignation, Kiwi shoves the gun she'd snagged from the ground into the back of her jeans. You've got your hands around Bucky's ankles as Kiwi and Climber take his torso -- and the four of you make a break for the back entrance. You can hear the cops outside now, and there's the chatter of Russian following you into the back parking lot.

""Hurry up!""

""He's not exactly light as a feather, you know!""


""Shut up, Climber!""


You've got Bucky halfway into the back seat of Kiwi's white Cadillac when another bullet whizzes by your head.

""Fuck.""

Kiwi hops into the driver's seat as Climber scatters to hop the hood and throws himself into the passenger's seat. You lean, clinging to the door of the backseat as Kiwi peels out of the parking lot. It swings wide open and you curse loudly. You can see Alexei's men watching from the back entrance, shouting in Russian -- so you muster all your strength to pull back and throw the door closed as Kiwi's car bounces over a speed bump and rams through the parking meter's gate.

In the rear window, the front of the club is surrounded.

Red and blue lights illuminate the street -- but Kiwi is quick.

No one follows.

And when she finally makes it to the Manhattan Bridge, you exhale.

Bucky's head is in your lap. He still hasn't come to -- there's blood coming from his nose and you're worrying. You lace your fingers into his thick, brown hair and chew your lip.

Kiwi's voice pulls you from him.

""When were you going to mention the vibranium arm, huh?""

You laugh. It's more of a breath of air than anything. Your head rests back against the seat. Your shoulder is still on fire. You're hot, but cold. You're bleeding still. Your ribs aren't right. You know that.

""I can't believe he shot you,"" Climber mumbles, ""He fucking shot you.""

""And your boy toy shot him,"" Kiwi says, sparing you a look in the rearview, ""So you better pray he's dead.""

You ignore the commentary.

""Where are we going?""

""Somewhere safe,"" she says, accelerating into Manhattan, ""Where I can get you those files and you can keep your head down.""

Sounds like a plan.

Better than the one you had, anyways.

Bucky wakes up with a headache that feels like someone's tapped an icepick between his eyes. A fire-bright burn radiates under his ribs.

It's a slow creep back to reality -- he just lays there and stares at the peeling wallpaper that meets the corner of the ceiling for a while, knowing deep in the back of his muddled, confused thoughts that he most likely has a nasty concussion, maybe a few broken ribs.

How? Hm. Fighting. Music? The club. 

Rabbit.

He sits up fast and Bucky's blue eyes struggle to adjust in the low-light of the scarcely furnished apartment. The searing pang of his headache is enough to make his stomach churn, but he's had worse. So much worse. This is manageable. So, he swallows down the nausea and looks around the room like a wounded animal -- and almost immediately, relief greets him at the sight of you in the armchair across from the couch.

Your hair is a mess, falling from it's previous style that you'd proudly worn to The Glass Cannon. Your lipstick is smeared, there's glitter on your cheeks, and your make-up has transitioned from starlet beauty to broken-hearted bombshell. Bucky notices, with a bit of dismay, that you're even missing an earring. There's a nasty bruise forming along the peak of your cheekbone and a gash there from when Alexei had cracked you across the face with the pistol -- and even despite all this, Bucky can feel his heart clench at the sight of you. A good clench. The sort that makes his heart kick into a stutter step.

You look... well, you look like someone who'd had the shit choked out of them and then was shot.


Shot. 


Your jacket, punched clean through with the single bullet hole, is hanging over the back of the chair and there's gauze taped to your shoulder. You're leaning your good cheek in your hand, attention turned totally to Bucky, where you've fallen asleep. From here, you're a picture of exhaustion.

Anxiety flashes in his heart and he swings his legs over the edge of the couch.

Suddenly, there's a hand on his shoulder.

""Take it easy.""

It's the woman from before, Kiwi, and she's got an ice pack in her hands. It's wrapped in a ratty, green dish towel, and she hands it off to Bucky with a pitiful little look. Rounding the couch, Bucky finally gets a better look at her.

She's older than you, maybe by a handful of years, but sharp and beautiful nonetheless. Her hair is dark as night and the tips are drenched in a lime-colored dye. Her eyes are dark, too, ringed by kohl and glitter, and Bucky wonders if he's ever seen her before.

""You heal quick,"" she says quietly as she plops down into the chair across the room. On a makeshift desk, there's a laptop, ""Care to explain how you know our dear friend Rabbit here?""

Bucky shifts uncomfortably. Again, his eyes fall on your sleeping form.

He maneuvers the ice pack in his hands, then gently presses it to his ribs. He melts a bit, ignoring the evident tears in the silk shirt. He feels bad -- he'd busted some of the seams in the midst of the brutal scuffle and it seems like this artifact of Jaimie's was most likely beyond salvation.

His dog tags jingle against his chest.

""Therapy,"" Bucky croaks, ""We, uh, we met in therapy.""

A new voice comes into the picture now, one that's muffled by a mouthful of food.

""That's cute.""

It's the other one, Climber. He's traded in his all-black, all-polyurethane outfit for an expensive-looking t-shirt. Without the strobes, without the tunnel vision, Bucky can now see the intricate buzz cut that sits beneath the mountain of blue curls on his head. There are patterns buzzed into his tight-shave. He's got a smile, too, the glimmers a little too artificially. Bucky spies crystals inset on his incisors between bites of what looks like a bowl of cereal with no milk. Spoon and all.

""I don't think we've properly met,"" Climber says as he plops down next to Bucky on the couch, ""What'd you say your name was?""

A hand is jutted his way. Bucky blinks. He shakes it with his vibranium hand.

""I'm Bucky.""

""Well, I'm gay and you're gorgeous,"" he says candidly, giving it a good shake, ""So, if that's of any interest--""

""Can you please shut up, Climber?"" comes an irritated rasp from you in your armchair. Bucky turns to watch as you raise your head and rub your eyes, ""Christ, I just fell asleep.""

""And your little super soldier just woke up,"" Kiwi chirps from her preoccupation with the laptop and contents on it, ""So why don't you stop being a little baby and let him look at that gunshot wound.""

Bucky's face falls flat. He drops the ice pack to the coffee table with a thwunk.

You sit up, gingerly trying to maneuver yourself so as to not bother both your ribs and your shoulder. It takes a moment, but finally you're sitting up with only a dull ache of pain throbbing beneath your skin. Now, the real sting comes from the bitter look Bucky has pinned you with.

""You haven't cleaned it yet?""

""The shits in the kitchen,"" Kiwi waves at Bucky, as if to say told you so, ""She fuckin' refused to let me take care of it.""

""You're going to get an infection if it stays in you any longer,"" he snaps, standing to his feet, ""Get up.""

""Kiwi isn't exactly the most gentle person I know,"" you manage to supply as an excuse as you move through the room, ""And I know that thing isn't coming out without a fight.""

He can feel the grey hairs coming in already.

You stand slowly, and Bucky looms behind you as you weave into the small apartment's kitchen.

It's barely lived in, but a few years ago it most definitely had life. Now, it's mostly abandoned save for a few necessities. Kiwi had told you, a long time ago, about this spot -- it was her parent's place before the Snap. After the Blip, they ended up moving back to Massachusetts. Now abandoned by anyone seeking to really live in the one-bedroom, it sits collecting dust until Kiwi inevitably needs it.

Like now.

""Up on the counter.""

You wince at his tone, but still thankful to be away from Kiwi and Climber's prying eyes.

For the entire time Bucky had been out, you'd been subjected to a myriad of questions -- all were fair, really, since Bucky did just bust out the Avenger-level super-moves on some Russian mafiosos for your sake, vibranium arm and all. The arm was really the biggest stuck point in the conversation as you tried your best to explain the nature of your relationship with the unconscious supersoldier on the couch. It was met with plenty of looks, both curious and skeptical.

You're slow to hop up on the dusty marble countertop. From there, you watch Bucky poke through the kit that Kiwi had pulled from under the sink.

Then, with the calculated process of a man who has pulled one too many bullets from himself, Bucky slams the kit shut and wanders into the bathroom.

He returns with a pair of large tweezers. He's silent as the dead as he rummages for a pan, fills it with water, and sets the gas burner on. He stares, watching the pot boil, as his foot taps against the floor.

You swallow down any comments.

There's a clean towel beside you, and Bucky casually reached into the boiling water with his vibranium hand to retrieve the tweezers -- whether or not he purposely ignored the pain is lost on you. You're too busy anxiously spiraling into silence.

(He's trying to ground himself, to feel something other than panic. It's a mild spike, but it's still panic. Because you're hurt. Because you still have a fucking casing lodged in your shoulder and he doesn't want anything bad to happen to you. Ever. Because he saw it happen and then it was black, and now that anxiousness is creeping in.)

Rubbing alcohol, tweezers, gauze, tape, and... Jack Daniel's. 

It's from the top of the fridge. It's got a layer of dust on it -- and it's unopened.

Bucky unceremoniously pops the cap and hands the open bottle to you.

You take it and pause.

Bucky's gaze is cold.

""You're gonna want to take a few swigs, Doll.""

You almost snarl. You take a long drink then, ignoring the burn of the whiskey down your throat. It's only when you've had enough to nearly gag that you hand the bottle back and then hiss:

""Don't call me Doll.""

He takes the bottle and unceremoniously slams it down on the counter.

His movements are rough as he washes his hands -- and if Bucky was a better person, maybe he'd take a second and parse through why he was feeling so damn irritable. But, no, no, he could figure out that he was angry at himself and you and Alexei Gardzov and Innessa Sidrova and fucking... everyone because he can't have any normal relationships in his life without there being bloodshed or pain or suffering. That was enough, and he didn't want to dig deeper into the nipping fear of losing you, not now, not when he had a job to do--

You suck in a sharp breath when his fingers brush your collarbone. He gently moves the delicate strap of your bodysuit, ignoring the soft skin beneath, and pulls the gauze away from your shoulder.

Your jacket had taken most of the impact it seems. Bucky frowns deeply at the pink fibers clinging to the entry wound. It's a nasty puckered bit of flesh, smeared with blood, right in the soft muscle of your left shoulder. The hole is a little smaller than a quarter -- Bucky recognizes it as shot from a 9mm almost immediately. He's taken a few of these in his days. He's glad it wasn't close range. The burns from the muzzle flash make for nasty scars. He'd know. He has one on his back, right above his hip.

Bucky's jaw is tight. He's gritting his back teeth. His headache throbs angrily behind his eyes.

Bucky leans, eyeing the wound carefully. His limited reaction is enough to spark a little light of bravery in your gut, and you move to look at the hole -- only to find a vibranium hand rooting your jaw in place. It's gentle enough as it recorrects the line of your gaze straight ahead. His thumb rests on the curve of your chin as his index climbs your jaw, and the vibranium is warm and cold all at once. It's an odd sensation. Not bad, but not flesh.

You like it.

(You find your mind quickly flashing with the thought of what that hand would feel like in other places. You ignore it.)

Your eyes are stuck on Bucky.

He's clearly upset -- the pinch between his brows and the evident scowl on his lips is enough of an indication. The bridge of his nose is busted and there's a bruise crawling under his left eye. The shirt you'd given him is a wreck, and as he bends to snatch up a rubbing alcohol-soaked pad, the feeling of shame creeps up on you. The anxiousness that's settled in the pit of your stomach doesn't help.

Arguably, it exacerbates the symptom.

The whiskey is slow to make an impact.

But, when Bucky finally swipes the gauze across the wound, your ankles have begun to tingle and it isn't blinding white pain you feel -- not yet. It's sharp and it feels like he's touching your shoulder blade when he presses his fingers into the holes to clean the immediate area. That has you grimacing tightly.

His obsidian-hued hand holds your face still through it.

So, you opt to stare.

His arm reminds you of some pottery you'd seen back at the Museum of Modern Art once, on a school trip. In a dimly lit room, spotlights lit up a row of vases that had been gilded back together with gold-dusted sap. You'd sat there for nearly an hour, staring at those things. You can't remember the name now, not while Bucky does one more pass across the wound. It started with a 'k'. It was beautiful. You loved that exhibit. Why can't you -- fuck -- remember the name? Kinsi... kinsigumi? Gumi. Kintsi --

You grit your teeth and grip the counter tightly. He pauses. You exhale.

You inhale.

Kintsugi.

The seams of his arm remind you of Kintsugi.

It's beautiful.

Bucky's eyes flit to yours. He sees your stare.

Maybe it's the pain, or the half-cocked daze, but the look in your eyes is enough to spur an immediate reaction. Bucky scowls. He yanks his hand back, retreating to the supplies on the counter. He's pulled, hard and fast, and now he seems miles away.

Quietly, and with a bit more chill than he intended, he speaks. ""If it was making you nervous, you should have said something.""


It. 


Your head snaps to him.

""What?"" you ask, nearly incredulously.

He's silent. He has the tweezers in his hand now.

Your eyes narrow critically -- and instead of shame and anxiety, it's hurt that flies off your tongue. It's drenched in enough pain that Bucky hears it in the waver of your voice.

""You think I'm afraid of you?""

It's nearly a whisper.

He swallows.

He ignores it. He has to. He doesn't want to know the answer. Either way that conversation goes is enough to drag him into territory he can't handle right now. Not when he needs to do this without his hands shaking.

""This is going to hurt.""

Your mouth is open -- be it shock or anger, he's not sure. Bucky, however, makes a point of ignoring your expression and your reaction by handing over the whiskey once more. You snatch it from his hands quickly. There's a look on your face that makes his chest ache. With one last pass over him with your eyes, you take a long swig.

You feel like crying.

You won't, though. Not now. Not while he does this.

You deserve this.

And holy fucking hell does it hurt. It's like someone's taken a hot poker and punctured your skin, then rotated it around and around and around. You can feel every time the tweezers touch the bullet because the metallic little click echoes in your chest. It's enough to make your head spin, and you grit your teeth and close your eyes and try to breathe -- but even after a handful of minutes, when Bucky finally retrieves the slug, there's no relief. Just a desperate throb.

Your hands are shaking when you reach for the whiskey once more.

You do cry, finally, when Bucky packs the hole.

He rolls the gauze up tightly into a cylinder and, as gently as he can, pushes it in.

It's a horrible choke of pain that you smother into your palm and pant through. It reminds you to breathe, and while you stare up at the water damage on the kitchen ceiling, Bucky tapes a square piece of gauze over the bruised wound and wraps your shoulder tightly. He takes his time, but there's a curtness to his actions.

Finally, when he begins to clean up the mess of bloodied gauze, you speak.

""If you're mad at me, then just say it.""

He snaps almost immediately, like a kicked dog. ""And say what, Rabbit? That I almost lost you?""

Your mouth slips shut.

Bucky pauses what he's doing. He drops the gauze onto the towel and he bares both hands against the countertop. He leans and exhales and drops his own head back -- then, you can see his own waves of anxiety knocking him against the shore of composure. His eyes move back and forth, he inhales, and then after a long while he speaks.

It's calmer. Not so horribly mean.

""You should have told me about Alexei.""

You go to speak -- but he stops you.

""I mean really, really told me,"" he explains, ""Had I known he wanted your fucking head mounted on a spike, I would have kept you far away from that place.""

""We had to--""

""No,"" he says sternly, standing up full height, ""No, we didn't. We never have to do anything that's going to put you in danger. Never. I won't do it again. You should have fuckin' told me.""

You're quiet.

""A few more inches to the right,"" he says, gesturing to your throat with his finger. His eyes are expressive and he's speaking like he's lived this experience, ""You'd be dead. Cold and dead and I'd be here, carrying the fucking guilt around with me because I wouldn't have been able to do anything."" 

His voice splinters at the end -- but he's moved to throw away the gauze and dump the tweezers in the sink. He can't look at you as he says it, and you know that. Because, just like before, people like you and him have a hard time looking the truth in the eyes.

You slide off the counter.

Your heart is sad. It's heavy and mournful and weighed down with guilt.


""Bucky.""


It's soft. He's scrubbing your blood from his hands.

He doesn't turn around. He can't. He can feel the prick of an anxious breakdown beginning to climb into his eyes. Instead, he scrubs and scrubs and scrubs and your blood is stuck in the plating of his hand and it's not going to come out--

Think of what could have happened if it had been a few inches to the right. The arched spray. Blood everywhere. She can't speak through the gargle, she's going cold, she's gone. And, like always, you're alone again, Bucky.

Then, your hands are on his.

The touch is enough to stop him. It's enough for him to move aside at the large, inset kitchen sink. You exhale slowly as you run the water a little warmer and gingerly run his hands under the tap. Your hands are smaller than his, a bit more delicate, and he's stunned into a sharp silence at the feeling of your fingertips gently washing away the crimson blood.

You grab another dishtowel from a drawer beside the stove.

Then, in the dim light of the kitchen, you take both his hands and dry them.

It's the vibranium hand that you pay special attention to, though. And Bucky feels like a fucking idiot -- just standing there, just watching as you run the rag between the gilded plating and use gentle pressure to get into the harder-to-reach spots. You turn it over, and you dry his knuckles.

You take your time.

You don't look up when you speak. You're focused. Almost reverent.

He doesn't deserve this.

""I'm not afraid of you,"" you say sternly.

His mouth is dry. ""Rabbit...""

Bucky shifts on his feet and takes a deep inhale. He feels lightheaded.

The whiskey, and the closeness of the two of you, makes your skin warm. His whole nervous system feels like it's on fire.

""I didn't mean to stare, I don't ever mean to,"" you apologize as your hands still over his arm. He watches your irises trace the plating above his wrist. The rag is forgotten, its purpose null. Your words are heavy, and Bucky can hear a little shake in them as you swallow, ""I just... think it's beautiful.""


You're beautiful.


Even now, blood-soaked and sweat-stained. With makeup running down your cheeks and your composure in shambles. Even now, on the run and apparently wanted, you're incredibly beautiful. Bucky hates how easy it is to admit and how hard it is to keep off his tongue. It nearly gets the better of him. He watches your eyelashes flutter. When you look up at him, the world is suddenly drowned in honey.

""I'm sorry.""

You mean it.

Your bottom lip wobbles.

Bucky, immediately, regrets being so goddamn cold.

You were just trying to help -- you were just trying to do the right thing.

""Stop it. Come here.""

The hug is the first time you can remember touching him like this. You think you'll always remember it, too. It's sturdy and warm and gentle and honest and you bury your face into the shoulder as his arms come up around your neck. He's careful of your own injured shoulder, and his fingers find the base of your neck. Around his waist, your fingers dig into the back of his shirt. Both of you ground yourselves in the other's arms, and for the first time in a handful of hours, you both find peace.

Quiet, sturdy, lovely peace.

And the two of you stay like that for a while in the quiet little kitchen.

It's not until Climber's voice rises from the living room that you're pulled away from Bucky -- and even then, your face linger inches from one another for a moment too long. Neither of you say a word, only swallow down confessions that could have been, and move on.

""Oh, girlie, you're gonna wanna see this.""

Bucky frowns. With your brows knotted tightly together, you weave through the kitchen and back into the living room.

Kiwi has sat up and both she and Climber have their eyes on the bulky flat screen on the dust-covered entertainment center. It's cable news, and as Climber leans to turn the television up, a picture of you flashes across the screen.

It's a photo from your arrest six months ago.


""Local authorities are asking that anyone with information on the whereabouts of this young woman call the FBI's anonymous tip line--""


""Is there a reward?"" Climber whispers almost excitedly, eyes on the screen.


""--Authorities are offering $100,000 dollars to the person who provides enough information to lead up to this dangerous fugitive's capture.""


""Dangerous fugitive?"" hisses Bucky.

""A hundred thousand dollars?"" cries Kiwi, ""Who the fuck did you piss off?""

You inhale deeply as you wave your hands. ""The bigger question is who the fuck knew I was going to The Glass Cannon last night. Because they're looking for me -- not you.""

You point at Bucky and the gears are turning in your head.

The pacing is almost immediate, and Bucky crosses his arms tightly as you begin to walk back and forth behind the full-length couch that Climber is currently spread out on.

It's cut short, though, by Kiwi's laptop chiming successfully.

""Well,"" she stands quickly, ""I have a feeling that someone knows you're onto them. And the facial recognition software just got a match. A three-point one, too.""

Your eyes brighten.

You'd given Kiwi the photo of the young Innessa, with all her decorated furs and blonde curls. She's laughing and she's young and she's in love and it's hard for you to imagine a woman like her to be dangerous. While you'd made sure Bucky was propped up comfortably on the couch and then finally calmed down from the adrenaline high enough to get comfortable yourself, Kiwi had dug out the hard-drive she kept on her at all times and began pulling data from the Alexandria Library files.

It had been a handful of hours, so it was clear that Innessa had hid herself well in the vast, expansive database SHIELD kept for all those years while it was in operation.

Bucky is quick to gather behind Kiwi, eyes scanning the screen.

Sure enough, when you come to look at the photos pulled up on Kiwi's screen, there's a hit. There's an identification card photo of an older woman, maybe in her forties, pulled up alongside the photo Bucky had given you. Her hair is no longer blonde, but deep auburn color. She's marked as having worked with Rumlow -- a supervisor of some sort. Makes sense. You didn't need to see a picture of Crossbones to remember Brock. Even when you'd interned, he'd been infamous.

And that was when he was one of the good guys.

There's a handful of other photos of her -- candids, professional photos, and even one where she is shaking Tony Stark's hand.

And in all of them, you see your next door neighbor Bonnie McLayne.

""Fuck.""

Bucky blinks. Kiwi turns to look at you over her shoulder.

Again, you speak. Your eyes are wide. You can't look away from the screen.

""Fuck, fuck. Fuck. Fuck.""

""Rabbit...?""


""Fuck.""


Bucky's face narrows considerably, confusion melting to make room for realization.

His voice is quiet.

""Do you know her?""

""Oh my god,"" you say loudly, shaking your head and blinking, ""Oh my fucking god, that's my neighbor.""

Bucky can feel his whole face go clammy.

""The neighbor who--""

""--Who I showed your fucking picture to,"" you nearly shriek, ""Like it was some cute little matchmaking game!""

Immediately both hands are over your face as you throw your head back. Now, the pacing has begun, and like you're being carried on autopilot, you begin to move back and forth and back and forth and--

""You don't think she'd hurt Poke, do you?""

""Rabbit.""

""Oh god, oh god--"" 

Oh.

Oh, you're having a panic attack.

Oh, that was quick. Brutally fast. Nearly immediate.

After all, she knows where your family lives. She gets Holiday cards from mom to give to you. She's been your closest friend for nearly six years. But she's not Bonnie, she's Innessa fucking Sidrova. She's seen you with Bucky. She knows -- she knows a lot and you don't know anything and you're miles from home, from Poke, from Mom, from Ana... Oh, god, the baby. The baby. 

""The baby.""

Bucky's voice is level. ""Rabbit, you gotta calm down.""

""I have to call my mom.""

""No,"" Kiwi snaps immediately, ""They're going to be watching for your cell phone pings. No calls, no texting, none of it. And god forbid this woman is one step ahead of the FBI--""

""Oh, god.""

You gasp like a fish out of water, paralyzing fear sending you to lean against the back of the couch.

You claw at your chest and try to remember what Dr. Hart said about these sorts of moments. Square breathing. In and hold and out and hold. Again and again.  

""Sit down,"" Bucky says as he returns to your side, nearly sweeping you up long enough to plop you down into the armchair from before, ""And do me a favor and breathe.""

The whiskey isn't helping right now.

""I'm trying.""

Another gasped breath.

Climber and Kiwi watch.

Bucky shakes his head sternly, kneeling on one knee and snagging your hands. ""Don't try. Just do it. You can do it. Just follow my lead -- you're the sidekick, after all. Remember? C'mon. There's the smile. Breathe.""

So you do.

In, hold. Out, hold. You draw a square with one hand on your jeans and hold onto Bucky's with the other.

Again, in and hold. Out and hold.

And again.

And then, you just listen to Bucky's breathing.

You're not sure how long it takes -- half an hour, ten minutes, who knows -- but finally you're able to calm the spiraling thoughts in your head. Finally, the loudness quiets down, you catch your breath, and the world isn't falling apart. The bite of anxiety still remains in the hollow of your chest and Bucky can see that when you finally open your eyes and squeeze his hand.

There's that look again between the two of you. The one from before, in the kitchen.

""Good?"" he asks quietly, blue eyes swimming with some sort of emotion you can't really pin down. Not now. Maybe, if you'd been a bit more collected, you would have seen it as infatuation. But, no. It's just... nice.

You swallow and nod.

""Damn, girl,"" says Climber from his spot on the couch, ""Now I'm starting to get the whole therapy thing.""

""Thanks, dickhead.""

""That's recent, isn't it?"" he asks, genuine worry crossing his face as he stands to gently pass a hand over your back, ""I don't remember it ever being this bad.""

Your face is sad. ""I was just partying through it back then. Distraction was always the best method and then... When I had no more distractions and it was just me? Alone? And, psh, the accident with Jaimie? It got worse. So much worse.""

Climber's eyes soften. ""I'm sorry, bunny.""

You try to put on a brave face.

Bucky stands from in front of you and begins his own pacing. This one isn't so much born out of anxious nature -- but more of a tactical logic born out of keeping you safe.

This wasn't exactly the turn he was expecting.

""You didn't recognize her?"" he asks after a moment, voice high and tight.

""I'm sorry,"" you wave a hand, exasperated, ""She doesn't exactly look the same as she did in the 70s.""

Kiwi frowns at the screen. ""Definitely botox.""

Bucky squints. He looks to you for an explanation.

You vaguely gesture to your face.

His brow lifts, he closes his eyes, and he sighs.

Kiwi is next to pipe up. ""It explains why the feds are looking for you, especially if she saw you with the one man she knows is looking to hunt her down -- so, I think it's best the both of you lay low for a couple of days.""

""Not to mention,"" Climber wags a finger, ""Bucky the Babe over here did just piss off one the smaller Russian crime families in New York. So, there's always that on top of the evil Nazi-HYDRA-woman-next-door.""

You groan.

""Poke has enough food for a week,"" Bucky says nearly reading your mind, ""He'll be fine.""

""So, what? We just wait here? Until something happens?""

""Sidrova is going to try and bait us out,"" Bucky mutters, ""She knows she can't just disappear. She's been settled for too long and we know too much. Engaging us in an altercation is how she'll do it. Plus, I have a feeling she wouldn't pass up an opportunity to shoot me in the knees after a few decades. So, we wait.""

""Few decades?"" Kiwi whispers.

""How old are you?"" Climber asks.

""Hundred and six.""

Both of them just blink at an unphased Bucky.

You sigh, finally standing on wobbly legs. ""This feels like a bad idea. I'm just stating that for the record.""

""Better than her hunting the both of you down,"" Kiwi supplies, ""You can stay here. There's cable, there's booze, and there's plenty of instant ramen to last you until winter.""

""Stale cereal, too.""

""Wait-- where are you two going?"" you ask, narrowing your eyes, ""You're leaving?""

""Keeping our hands clean,"" Kiwi says, closing her laptop, ""And letting you be the sidekick, bunny.""

The sadness in your heart grows a little heavier at those words, but there's a little bit of pride in Kiwi's tone. As she stands, she moves to wrap her arms around you in a gentle hug. Quietly, she murmurs into your hair.


""Your dad would be proud of you, y'know.""


Bucky watches.

Climber is next, and that hug is bigger, more brotherly, more like sunshine and less like autumn.

""Don't be a stranger, Rabbit.""

""I'm sorry,"" you blurt out as the two of them gather their belongings, ""For dragging you both into this. But, thank you. You didn't have to help me--""

""Yeah, we did,"" Kiwi chirps as she knocks Bucky on the arm three times, ""Keep her safe, khoobsurat ladka.""

The Hindi rolls off her tongue with ease.

Bucky laughs. ""Phir milte hai.""

Kiwi pauses mid-step. She narrows her eyes. There's a smile on her lips. ""Your pronunciation isn't bad.""

He shrugs plainly. ""I get lunch almost every day at the Indian place below my apartment, so. The owner has been teaching me some stuff on the side.""

An approving nod.

Kiwi hucks you the keys across the room.

She points at Bucky.

""I like him. Try not to fuck that up, eh?""

And then, the two of them are gone.

And it's just you and Bucky in the empty apartment.

On the run, but together.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

""So, you don't have any Avenger friends that could help us out of this one?""

You're laying on the carpet, parallel to Bucky's lounged pose on the sofa. You've been staring at the ceiling for the three and a half hours since Kiwi and Climber left, half shocked at how anticlimactic this is and half relieved there's been no grandiose threat on your life or, like, the entirety of New York City.

That would kinda suck. You've lived through enough world-stopping superhero conflicts to know that would just be an inconvenience at this point. Bad for traffic. Y'know? Plus, taxes went up enough after the Battle of New York. You really weren't looking for a repeat. You could barely afford rent.

Not like you're worth a world-stopping inconvenience, but Bucky's little mission to bring down a remaining HYDRA pawn was. Whether or not he liked it, you'd filled the role of sidekick pretty readily. Turns out there are consequences to actions like that.

And I mean, this is all sort of a lot to process -- hence why you're on the floor. Just... laying there.

Bucky's on the couch; he commandeered the Jack Daniel's rather quickly after assessing the booze stash Kiwi kept in a cabinet above the sink. He's leaned back against the pillows, boots discarded and jacket long forgotten. His attention is mainly on the PBS special on The Dust Bowl playing on the television above your head. The room is dark and Bucky's features are carved out by the light of the program's grainy 1930 photography.

""They aren't my friends,"" he says absently, taking a swig from the handle, ""So no.""

""Seriously?"" you ask, sitting up with your hair askew, ""Come on. You're likable. Fun. Even funny, sometimes, I'll give you that. You can't call in a favor? What about Falcon?""

Bucky spares you a deadpan look. ""Don't go there.""

You shrug, take that as the best answer you'll get, and then squint at the handle.

""Christ, Bucky,"" you whisper at the now half-empty bottle, ""Feelin' alright?""

""No,"" he says with a bit of disappointment, ""It's water.""

""It's really not,"" you muster as you slowly stand to your feet and ignore the hot flare of pain in your shoulder, ""It's actually the complete opposite.""

""Well, it tastes like water,"" he mumbles, ""Just worse.""

You snort quietly as you round the couch. He offers the handle as you pass him and you pause long enough to take a swig. You grimace, swallow it down, and ignore the burn in your stomach.

Your fingers brush his as you hand the bottle back.

You disappear around the back of the couch.

Bucky's attention, like always, has now been traded in favor of you -- he's finding it hard to pay attention on the PBS show when you're not in his immediate vicinity. Almost on cue, Bucky wonders if that anxiety will ever ease up. He listens and hears you begin puttering in the kitchen. You mumble a few curses, open and close a few cabinets, then sigh loud enough that it makes Bucky turn his head over the edge of the ratty couch to eye your shadow against the tile floor.

""Everything alright in there?""

""I need to change,"" you call back with a dash of tenseness he's been picking up in your voice since they've made it to the safehouse, ""And shower. And eat--""

""And change your gauze,"" he shouts, ""So go shower and when you get out, I'll reapply a clean set.""

You tiredly stomp back into the doorway. You stand there for a second.

Bucky does a double-take.

""What?""

""You know when you're just so,"" you wave your hands around your head, ""Wound up? And you just can't slow down?""

Bucky frowns. It's no wonder you're still anxious -- after all, the waiting game wasn't easy. He'd be lying if he said that he wasn't also wound up like a top, waiting for the next fight. It's a bad habit, and an old one. Bucky shifts on the couch and leans his arm against the back of the cushions.

""You haven't sat still since they left,"" he explains slowly, ""So c'mon. Sit down.""

""I feel gross.""

Bucky gestures to his current state; blood and sweat, and a silk shirt that's torn along the shoulders and back. His black jeans are dirty from the dragging, no doubt, and the busted part of his nose is starting to turn purple. It's safe to say he's seen better days -- and as you round the couch again to sit on the edge, you scratch your arm.

""You don't... feel..."" again, the finger-wagging, ""Overwhelmed?""

""Almost always,"" he says as he pats the cushion closest to him. You scootch over as he lays his head back and fiddles with the Jack Daniel's bottle, ""I'd say about, uh, 98% of the time?""

""You're good at hiding it.""

""Like a horse with blinders,"" he clicks, turning his head to offer a sympathetic look, ""So relax. I doubt Innessa is going to make a move tonight.""

You huff, hips bumping his. You lean to peel the thigh-high boots off and toss them unceremoniously under the coffee table. You stretch your legs, lean back, and if you close your eyes you could almost imagine you and Bucky back on that couch in the waiting room of Dr. Hart's office. Almost. You can hardly sit still.

""How's your head?"" you ask quietly, eyes watching the photography roll by of the dust-ridden prairies, ""Any better?""

""He rang my bell pretty good,"" Bucky shrugs, staring ahead, ""Not the worse, though.""

""You were pretty skilled with those tweezers,"" you mumble, head lolling back as you finally find a comfortable position. Your legs are tucked up, your arms pulled close. You're half leaning on Bucky's good arm, but he doesn't seem to mind.

""I've picked a good number of bullets out of myself before.""

""Really?""

He nods. Bucky settles deeper into the cushions and rubs the stubble along his cheek. He braces the handle of whiskey on his thigh and turns his head slightly to look at you in the low light of the living room.

""More than I care to admit,"" the look in his eyes is sad.

You frown.

You pull your arms around yourself a little tighter and fix your attention on the TV. If you look at him for much longer, you're convinced you'll implode. There's just... feelings. A lot. You're feeling a lot. Feelings are cool. And you've wanted to feel but... not now. Not right now. If the casual numbness you've been living with for the last five years could just, yknow, come back for a day or two? That'd be great. It definitely would make things a little easier to process.

Especially the indescribable feeling that hits you like semi everytime Bucky looks at you.

""Well,"" you say softly as you swallow down the emotional heartburn, ""I owe you.""

""I can say with confidence that making you pull a bullet out of my ass is the last way I want you repaying a debt to me.""

You snort. Bucky is smiling. Barely there, and mostly a tug at the corners of his lips, but it's a smile.

He offers the bottle of Jack Daniels and you wave him off. ""All yours, Mr. Avenger.""

He sips it and raises a finger as he does. After swallowing roughly, Bucky turns his head again to shoot you a look. ""Not an avenger.""

""You sort of are.""

""No,"" he corrects you, ""Definitely not.""

You turn, facing him fully. Your expression is comical. ""Why not?""

""I'm not a hero,"" another swig, ""That's why.""

""You saved my ass.""

""Yeah, well, you're my friend,"" Bucky explains with as much distance from his words as possible, knowing full-well he's walking into a trap of his own creation, ""And I care about you.""

""So, what,"" you lean your good arm back against the cushions, ""You're saying you wouldn't do the same thing for someone you didn't know?""

Bucky clears his throat. After a moment, he speaks. It's quiet.

""I would. But there are a lot of people who don't believe I would.""

Your face falls.

Bucky glances at you out of the corner of his eye.

Then, he exhales.

""Steve was the only one who really believed in me,"" Bucky fiddles with the cap of the handle, ""Even Sam -- Falcon, y'know -- he had plenty of reason to distrust me. All of them did. Especially Stark. And I don't blame them in the fuckin' slightest.""

He takes a bitter swig.

He sits up, enough to lean forward on his knees.

""I wasn't always like this.""

""Really?"" you say, trying to lighten up his apparent flare of melancholy, ""Coulda fooled me, I thought you came out of the womb with that metal arm.""

Bucky scoffs. It's mostly to himself. But, you take credit.

""I mean -- I mean I wasn't always alive,"" he leans back as his eyes find his vibranium hand, ""I was, sure, but... It wasn't my life. They called me an asset -- and honestly, between the brainwashing and the IV bags and the muzzle and the flash-freezes... I dunno. Sometimes I forget to be thankful I can walk down the street and order a coffee.""

Your face falls. You're quiet for a while after that; you sit with the words. All you can muster is a very quiet reply.

""That sounds like it could be really overwhelming.""

""Oh, yeah,"" he replies almost immediately, his brows raising as he stares off into the distance, ""The first time I ever ordered lunch for myself -- y'know, after the Blip when I'd come back to New York? I had a fuckin' breakdown in the middle of a Tasty Burger. Too many choices. I stood there like a dunce. Just froze up over a milkshake flavor.""

You scoff quietly out of relatability. You prop your head in your hand and watch his expression settle down. ""It's weird how it's always the small stuff, huh?""

""Always,"" his head turns as he nods, ""And haircuts. I... I can't do haircuts.""

You quirk your brows. Bucky notices.

He opens his mouth, pauses, then closes it. Almost like he's trying to figure out how to explain it -- but then he takes his forefinger and presses it gently to the base of his skull.

""They would wipe me,"" he explains slowly, ""And everytime, they'd sedate me and shear me like a sheep. Made it easier with the, fuckin'... uh, things. Oxygen and feeding tube and everything. And there was a chip back here -- just for tracking. And I remember... it was in the 90s... One of the agents in charge of preparing me for the ice tried to shave my head.""

His face warps. It's pain. He stares off past the TV.

""I killed him,"" he says slowly, ""So no more haircuts.""

You blink. Your expression remains calm, however, and Bucky's anxiety eases up at that. You gesture to the short crop of his hair now. ""What changed?""

""It was too long,"" he mutters, ""Kept thinking how my mum would roll in her grave if she saw it. So, I went to a barbershop in Brooklyn. And it was fuckin' terrifying.""

Your smile is gentle. ""But, you did it.""

Bucky's expression hesitates. He's drawn in by your smile, and ducks his head. It's almost bashful.

""Yeah, well, I looked like Rapunzel.""

""I'm sure it wasn't that bad,"" you chastise and knock his shoulder with your hand, ""Don't be dramatic.""

Bucky snorts. ""Listen, I don't have much to work with. The hair is usually my saving grace. Has been all my life.""

""Oh my god,"" you drop your head back as you groan, ""Do I need to buy you a mirror?""

Suddenly, you spy a look -- it's boyish, and suddenly he looks years younger. Not so much one hundred and six, but maybe twenty-six. Bucky's expression flits into one that's sunny, and he tugs the corners of his mouth down as he shrugs. He's gloating, almost, as he leans back against the sofa once more.

""I mean, you could always just tell me I'm better looking than Steve,"" he chirps, shrugging again, ""But, c'mon. We both know that's a lie--""

Your jaw falls open.

Then, Bucky finally laughs.

You, frantically, wave your hand between the two of you. ""I'm sorry, we were just having a nice moment, but no -- you had to drag Captain America into this...?""

""It's my deepest insecurity.""

""Clearly,"" you chirp and slap his arm, ""And I think it's a stupid insecurity. Along with the whole, 'I am no hero' thing. Just because you were forced to do bad things, doesn't mean you're a bad person, Buck. You're great. You're kind and you're caring and even if you're a little broody, all that other stuff is still true. And fuck HDYRA.""

You both share a knowing nod.

His silence is contented. Comfortable.

You take it as a cue to turn your attention back to the television -- but, almost as soon as you do, he speaks tenderly.

His focus, again, is on you. Completely, totally, whole-heartedly.

""I like when you call me Buck.""

""Better than Jimbo,"" you chirp, trying to smother the desperate ache in your heart. You catch his gaze for a second too long -- just like before -- and squirm against the sofa, ""Or Jimmy.""

""Watch it, Bunny.""

Your frown is immediate.

Your face feels hot.

""Shut up.""

He snickers to himself. He leans back, and the two of you watch that stupid PBS documentary.

At some point, you're not sure when, you fall asleep.

It isn't the best sleep seeing as you're curled up into a ball on the sofa, having collapsed towards the other end and carefully steering clear of disturbing your little injury from last night. However, when you wake up, the sun is out and there's a blanket over your shoulder and the shower is running.

The first few seconds of being awake is met with confusion -- mostly because Bucky is gone.

Then, you hear the humming.

Quiet and muffled.

You swing your legs over the edge of the couch and stretch out the nasty kink in your back before hobbling up and rolling your neck. Almost immediately, you miss Poke -- he would have already pestered you for breakfast by now. But, no.

Off the kitchen is a hallway that leads to the master bedroom. In there, the shower is running, and in there, you hear the continued melody. But then it stops, and then he starts humming again -- almost like he'd forgotten how it went. It's hesitant. Quiet. Slow. Deep.

For a minute or so, you stand there and you listen.

Rubbing your eyes, you laugh a little. You lean against the doorframe to the master bedroom. Then, you knock on the frame twice.


""Son of a bitch."" 


It clearly scared him enough to jump because the clatter of shampoo and soap is enough to make you croak out a quiet little laugh. Bucky, beyond the other wall, sighs loud enough that you can hear it. You stand there, leaning against the doorframe, and watch the steam seep from the partially cracked door to the master bathroom.

""Vera Lynn called,"" you say loud enough that he can hear, ""She's wondering what you'd like for breakfast.""

After a second or two, the water shuts off. Then, after some rummaging, Bucky's face appears in the crack of the door. His hair is a mess -- you can tell he'd just run the towel he's clutching around his waist over it. It's sticking up in an array of dishevelment.

""Do me a favor,"" he chirps, narrowing his eyes at your evident smirk, ""And tell Vera to fuck off.""

You drop your head back and laugh.

As you meander back to the kitchen, you call over your shoulder:

""That's no way to talk to a lady, Sergeant Barnes!""

Kiwi's stockpile is pretty meager. It was evident she really didn't find herself spending time in this apartment often -- there are the bare essentials in the cabinets and fridge, and arguably way too much canned food. But, there are half-stale Cheerios that you happily pour into a bowl and munch on as Bucky finishes up in the bathroom.

You do a double-take when he comes into the kitchen.

""Could that shirt be any tighter?""

He rolls his eyes as he ducks past you to the coffee pot.

""I found it in the closet -- Kiwi had a few things in a bin under the bed, too. So, if you wanna change out of..."" he gestures vaguely to the open back of your bodysuit, ""Be my guest.""

Your brows climb your face as you take another bite of a handful of Cheerios.

""Oh, right, I forgot,"" you wave him off, ""Grandpa gets nervous around too much skin.""

""That cannot be comfortable,"" he says almost immediately as to avoid your dig; he leans back against the counter, ""I mean, how do you even get into that thing--""

You turn to face him, and in that moment, catch him pulling verified elevator eyes.

He clears his throat and purposely turns back to the coffee pot.

You laugh.

""Go ahead,"" you chirp as you chew, ""Keep going, you're almost starting to sound believable.""

""Shut up.""

You finish the cereal quickly, dumping the bowl in the sink. On the way by, you toss Bucky an amused look. He's sipping his lukewarm coffee as you do. With a solid pat on the arm, you turn on your heel and weave through the kitchen after calling out:

""If I need any help getting it off, I'll make sure to ask.""

He opts to keep his mouth shut, grit his jaw, and sip his coffee.

The bathroom isn't anything special -- in fact, it reminds you of your own bathroom when you first moved in. This space is a bit neglected, a bit older, and the shower is a tub-style stall. It's not horrible. It could be worse. The water is still warm, too, from Bucky's earlier shower, so it doesn't take long for it to heat up.

Your reflection is a little startling.

You almost laugh -- your hair is a tangled mess, your make-up is looking more like an impressionist painting by the minute, and the nasty gash across your cheek has swollen partially. It's a delicate lilac color, and a deeper red by the inch-long cut. You turn your head and gently touch your cheek.

You wince.

Your reflection, however, is different.

In the last five years, all you've known is vacant mirrors.

Seeing yourself was enough to kick the daily dissociation into action -- and though you knew the slope of your nose, the quirk of your smile, the round of your cheeks, you never really knew the woman staring back at you. She was far-away, and you were somewhere else. Never here, nor there.

But, now?

You're here.

You're bruised and you're bloody but you're here.

Despite it all, it makes you smile.

It is, admittedly, getting your bodysuit off that ends up being the biggest obstacle. Not-so-shockingly, getting shot in the shoulder does a lot insofar as impeding your movement. Wild. Absolutely didn't see that coming -- or, well, maybe you didn't want to admit the fact getting shot wasn't all it was cracked up to be in the movies. It was more poetic in a Tarantino film.

But, your pride be damned. You end up getting the bodysuit off. And it only takes about, like, fifteen minutes of sweating and cursing.

Half-way through, Bucky knocked on the bathroom door, too. Gently, he asked if you need any help. With the suit half off and your pants flung unceremoniously in the corner, you'd bashfully hollered that you were fine! Totally fine!

(Not fine, definitely not. Your neck was cramped up.)

You do, however, stand under the water for a while. You're overly careful of not getting the gauze too wet, and you decide that this is the only time you'll ever settle on using a three-in-one, but after about 16 hours of sitting in your own blood, sweat, and tears, this shower was perfect.

When you finally shut the water off and step out, there's another careful knock on the door.

While you'd taken your time in the shower, Bucky had paced outside like a guard dog.

In all fairness, it was the pained curses that brought him into the master bedroom the first time. Then, he'd decided that he'd dig out some t-shirts that were about your size from the bin in the closet. There's one from a vacation with California scrawled across it. It's faded, but it looks like it will fit. There's even more clean undergarments in the dresser to the side. Clearly Kiwi's. Bucky feels a little weird tossing a pair on the bed, so, like a grown man he quickly shuts the drawer and makes a note to let you know.

Y'know, like a grown man with a bad case of heart-eyes for his best friend.

Hell, he'd watched you fall asleep like he was cradling his whole world last night -- and he caught himself doing it, too. All he could do was rub his face, curse, and try to push those feelings down and out.

It hadn't worked.


Big surprise there, James.


Bucky clears his throat as he knocks on the bathroom door.

He's got the first aid kit under his arm.

You open the door and steam surrounds you like a halo. Bucky blinks a few times, tries to ignore the dewy glow on your face as you smile sheepishly at him, and rattles the first aid kit in his hands.

""I'll be quick.""

You nod and pull the door open.

Immediately, his face is hot. You clutch the cream colored towel around you as wet tendrils of hair cling to the sides of your face. Bucky sets up the kit on the counter of the sink as you lean backwards against the quartz countertop. He ignores the way the towel falls along the tops of your thighs. Or, well, tries. He makes a point of taking his time digging out the right gauze and the right tape.

It's a lost cause.

""I put some clothes out for you.""

""I guess the body suit is a lost cause, huh?""

You're smiling.

He snorts softly through his nose. He spares a look at the crumpled pile of clothes in the corner.

""I was nervous I was going to have to bring the jaws of life.""

""You almost did,"" you jut your chin in the direction of your shoulder, ""Didn't realize how bad this hurt.""

Bucky frowns as he enters your personal space. Carefully, he reaches to pull at the edge of the tape keeping the square piece of gauze in place, his eyes flick up to your face. He's looming over you, head tilted down, lip pulled between his teeth in quiet concentration.

Your eyes find his face.

He's handsome.

You remember thinking it the first time you ever saw him -- and it's still true. Even with a busted nose and a nasty bruise forming under his eye. He's tall, dark, and handsome. He's your best friend.

And even worse, you're starting to think these feelings for him aren't going to go away anytime soon.

Almost immediately, you're caught in the act of tracing his features with your eyes; his blue eyes connect with yours and the two of you stop breathing. The closeness is smothering. It's like the world stops -- and there's a feeling like plunging into the deep end that falls into the pit of your stomach. His fingers still against your skin.

Then, ever so delicately, his thumb and forefinger find your chin like before. He guides your face to the side; his breath is tight. It tickles your neck.

He's trying to focus.

You try to catch your breath.

You stare at the wall.

Bucky's voice is quiet. Smooth.

Suddenly, he's tracing a scar on the underside of your jaw with the tip of his finger. It's a contemplative action but the trail of his touch burns like a match on gasoline. It ignites your skin. You inhale deeply.

""I never noticed this.""

His fingers still over your throat.

Your voice shakes. You swallow.

""It's from the car accident.""

You pull your hair back and gesture to another set into your hairline by your temple.

Bucky watches as he reaches for the new roll of gauze. As you begin to talk, he's quick with cleaning out the packed wound -- quick enough that you only have time to wince before he's moved on.

""When, uh, the Snap happened,"" you say, ""We were taking a trip up to see a house outside of Albany that Jaimie and Fei were looking to buy. My mom was driving and Jaimie was in the backseat and... I dunno. Next thing I know, Mom is gone. I remember being so confused, and then I tried to grab the wheel, and then... We hit the median at 70 miles per hour. It all happened fast.""

Bucky's silence is mournful. His eyes find yours.

""I'm sorry, Rabbit.""

""It wasn't only us,"" you fiddle with the hem of the towel, ""Accidents were happening all up and down the highway. It was... It was like a fuckin' warzone. Jaimie was ejected. The car crumbled like a paper ball. I'm lucky, though. Broke my arm, but I only have those two scars to show for it.""

He runs his thumb along the new line of tape he's put down.

""You and I both know,"" he says slowly, ""Shit like that leaves different sorts of scars.""

He's right.

But, you don't need to tell him that.

He smoothes the gauze, clicks the first aid kit shut, and turns towards the door.

For the rest of the day, your skin feels like it's been kissed by fire.

Bucky can't sleep.

Considering he's been up for a grand total of about 45 hours, he was hoping that the moment he'd sprawled himself out on the apartment floor, he'd pass out. But, no. Instead, he found himself tossing and turning for about three hours on the hardwood -- and then for another two on the couch. Every time he'd get even remotely comfortable on that ratty old couch, he'd roll and nearly throw himself off. Truth be told, he was just too long for it.

So, that's how Bucky finds himself staring at the door of the master bedroom at 10:47pm.

You'd gone to bed a handful of hours ago after scarfing down some ramen and tylenol -- leaving Bucky to surf the handful of cable television shows until he settled, once again, on PBS. This time, the documentary was on badgers. Pretty quickly, he'd turned on CSPAN and let it run. The background noise usually helped him fall asleep and stay asleep, but nothing was working tonight.

There's a part of him that wonders if the bed would be a viable option.

After all, he'd unceremoniously passed out in his apartment's bed the night you'd first tried to dig up dirt on Innesaa. But, you're in that bed, and Bucky is having a bit of crisis trying to figure out if sleeping on a mattress would actually help, or if a part of him is just yearning to be close to you.

... Okay, part of him is yearning to be close to you.

That's a given.

A horribly cruel given that's currently making him press his palms into his eyes and lean back into the couch.

Fuck.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Whatever, y'know what? Fuck it.


Fuck it!


... Nope.


Sit back down, Barnes. 


So, he sits there for the next fifty minutes debating whether or not he should knock on your door -- and finally, eventually, like it was always destined to happen, he knocks around midnight.

You shoot awake.

You're not sure what you say -- but it's a panicked sound that's born mostly out of a deep sleep, mid-REM cycle sort of confusion. Bucky almost laughs, but it quick to quietly move into the room and say your name once more.

""It's me.""

""What's wrong?"" you ask immediately, eyes barely open and hair askew, ""Innessa?""

""No,"" he says shyly, ""Can't sleep.""

You relax, almost instantly melting back into the sheets. You're propped up to avoid putting too much pressure on your shoulder. You look like some story-book princess. Bucky feels incredibly conscious of his everything.

""You wanna sleep here,"" you mumble, rolling to make room, ""S'fine.""

""You sure?""


""Mm.""


The look on his face is openly fond. You're already falling back asleep, though, and there's no use in hiding it. Just him and his demons are there to see it.

So, in gym shorts that are way too short and a t-shirt that's one size too small, Bucky Barnes climbs onto the bed. The borrowed clothes aren't exactly comfortable, but even above the sheets he can already feel himself melting back into a quieter state than before.

Your breathing evens out, and Bucky turns his head to watch you.

For a moment, all he can do is smile.

Then, he falls asleep.

In the other room, your phone rings through to voicemail.

as always, you can find me at whirlybirbs.tumblr.com!

Thank you so much for the patience on this chapter!

As always, you can find me at whirlybirbs.tumblr.com!

It's that dream again.

The one where Andrei's life is being snuffed out, and his wife is crying, and the Winter Soldier is turning Innessa Sidrova into the monster she will inevitably become. The dining room is cold. Bloody veal stains white, bone china plates. Little forks and sharp knives. Red carpet. Red curtains.

Someone brings out cake on a golden tea cart. It rattles by.

Andrei's body is slumped in his chair. No one moves him.

Blood.

Then, Bucky's eyes open to sunlight.

And to you.

You're sitting up over him; worry is carved deep into your brow as you clutch the fabric of his shirt -- and he realizes almost immediately he must have been talking in his sleep. You smooth his shirt down upon noticing the sleepy state of his blue eyes and exhale. It's a gentle touch. It grounds him.

You look like an angel.

Warm light filters through the curtains -- and you're glowing, bathed in gilded light.

It takes him a moment to register this isn't some domestic fantasy, but that the two of you are still locked away in this fuckin' safehouse. Waiting.

""Bad dream?"" you ask gently, sitting back against the pillows as he rubs his face. You pull away, focused tightly on the closeness the two of you had shared all night.

You'd woken up tucked neatly beside him, with your cheek touching his shoulder. Despite having been swallowed by the sheets, you'd gravitated towards his warmth at some point in the night. It was his voice, low and fearful, that had woken you up. You couldn't make out what he was saying. He was deep enough in his sleep that he had barely moved when you'd tried to gently poke him awake.

""A memory,"" he says roughly as he sits up -- his voice is hoarse with exhaustion, ""Innessa.""

You frown, rub your eyes, and roll to check the bedside clock. It's nearly noon. You'd slept like the dead. Apparently, you needed it. This morning, your chest doesn't feel alight with the ever-present prick of anxiousness -- like a looming blow to the heart. You can handle that anxiety now, like wading in rough water. You're not drowning.

""When we finally find her,"" you say slowly, taking advantage of your morning-born courage. You swing your legs over the side of the bed, ""What will happen?""

Bucky watches you look out the window.

""She will be apprehended by the Feds -- questioned, arraigned. Most likely, she'll serve a life sentence for her crimes against the United States.""

""Treason?""

""Among a lot of other shit,"" he says as he stands up and rolls his neck. It pops. He swings his vibranium arm, loosening the stiff joints. You turn to watch him over your shoulder, ""Finding people like her, the ones that slipped away, is part of my pardon. Feels wrong -- because I made her into the person she is. And here I am. Free.""

""You know that wasn't you. It was the Winter Soldier.""

""Was it?"" he says as he moves towards the bathroom, ""Because some days, it's awfully fucking hard to seperate me from him.""

He closes the door to the bathroom gently after a long look in the mirror, and then the shower turns on.

And you sit with that.

He isn't really free -- that much is apparent. The nightmares, the burden, the echoes... What they did to him has stuck and it's stuck hard. He is learning how to be human, how to feel and how to live. You don't like the sour taste his self-deprecation leaves in your mouth. It unsettles your stomach and it makes you angry in a way you don't know how to understand. Maybe it's because you know Bucky is a good man.

Maybe it's because you're in love with him.


...Fuck.


Yea. You are.

Aren't you?

Fuck.

You sit with your knees pulled close on the edge of the bed and watch the distant skyline of the city. Outside, the world turns on. It's disorienting to feel so removed from it, even if this is the third day spent in the isolation of the safehouse. There's a part of you that's hoping, with a little bit more time, things will die down and disappear. But, you know better. You broke the conditions of your parol, and Innessa made sure that obstacle would stop you from finding her immediately.

It gave her enough time to plan.

To get the upper hand.

Bucky was right about a lot of things, though -- the two of you knew too much. She'd been in Brooklyn for too long now to uproot and reconfigure her identity. She's older. Tired of running. She'll want one of two things: revenge, or absolution.

You desperately hope it's not the first.

You think about it for a while -- and when Bucky exits the shower, you're still there. Perched on the edge of the bed, you turn at the sound of the door opening.

Bucky pauses in the doorway.

Your eyes immediately fall to his bare torso, to the way his vibranium hand clutches at the once-soft towel around his hips. He stiffens considerably once your eyes land on the bruising around his ribs -- and you try to keep your shock as quiet as possible. Worriedly, you stand and round the bed. As you stand, you ignore the own ache of your muscles and sting of your shoulder.


""Jesus...""


""Not my name,"" he chirps, trying to deflect as your hand meets the hot skin of his back.

Bucky inhales sharply at the contact -- and he tries, desperately, to ignore the burning ache to feel more. He'd sell his soul a thousand times over for the promise of your hands across his skin. You're horribly gentle, and so careful that Bucky finds his heart turning black with self-pity. 

He doesn't deserve this. You.

Christ alive, he's in love with you.

Every part of you -- the slope of your nose, the way you say his name, the way you look at him like he's a man worth redeeming... 

It hits him hard. Too hard. 

It's almost painful how much he feels in that moment.

He swallows roughly.

""I didn't know they were this bad,"" you say as you press into his back, making him rotate. The muscles along his ribs are well-defined. The bruises are purple and haloed by ghosts of yellow.

Bucky clears his throat.

""I heal quick. It'll be fine.""

He does -- his nose is already mostly healed and the bruise beneath his eye is considerably lighter than it was twelve hours ago. Still, it does very little to alleviate your pout.

For the sake of himself, he pulls away.

You recoil your touch.

There's a frown on your face, but Bucky ignores it -- and you make enough room for him to dig through that bin of clothes Kiwi had stored under the bed.

With one more lingering look at him and the carnage of his bruise-kissed skin, you snag your jeans and meander into the bathroom.  

By the time you both reconvene, you're both dressed -- but in clothes that are either too big, or too small, with jeans that have seen better days. At least you have clean socks. And you're alive. And the world hasn't started to fall apart. Yet.

Bucky makes the coffee, and you gather your usual bowl of cereal, and you think that maybe today will be just as boring as the other days, but...

You're wrong. Very wrong. 

It's only by chance that you look at your phone. You, honestly, were missing Poke terribly. He was your constant companion, and the idea of leaving him home alone with a literal killer next door was a bit worrisome. You reached for the phone, hellbent on seeing as the little, round calico that was your lock screen. Seeing his photo would be enough to beat back the guilt and sadness.


Or not.


Over Mr. Pokebowl's face sits one notification.

A voicemail.

Your gut sinks.


""Bucky.""


He's in the kitchen, digging through the fridge -- as much as he likes his coffee strong and black, he desperately needs something with it. The caffeine does little for his anxiety. Even a piece of toast would be good, but... He guesses he will settle for the dry cereal you've been eating like a heathen.

When you call his name, though, he knows something has happened. It's the sound of it. Like you've been plunged into ice-cold water, like your gasping for air.

He half expects it to be something on the news -- but when he rounds the wall and sees you staring at the phone in your hands, he knows. He knows it's Innessa. He knows she's made her play, and they need to get ready.

He sees the notification.

""Play it.""

It's from Fei.

Fei. Your beautiful sister-in-law was more level-headed than your mother -- and while mom would go out of her way to leave you voicemails, insisting that those were not direct communication and therefore would not break the conditions of your pardon, Fei was careful. She had said, once, after the sentencing, that she would only ever call if it was something serious. She wanted you to be safe, to be happy, to grow from the bullshit of the past six years.

And she had the baby. Naomi is six months old. She's got your brother's eyes.

Fei's voice is shaking.

You can hear rustling, like she's trying to gather something up -- clothes, maybe, or papers?


""Bunny, it's Fei -- she has mom. She came in here and she has mom and she had a fucking gun -- she said she was your neighbor, the one we send the cards to and this was about business between you and her. What is going on? Where are you? Are you safe? Please call me back. I-I, uh, I don't know what to do--""


And it cuts off.

Then, like some twisted, stupid horror movie, Bucky's phone begins to ring.

You swear this is all too much all at once -- your own brain is beginning to have trouble slowing itself down enough to retrace the events of the last few days, and now with the added fear creeping in at the prospect of Innessa having somehow dragged your family into this as--


Leverage.


Bucky knows it's leverage.

It's good leverage, too.

It's Dr. Raynor.

He picks it up with a shift in his eyes.

""Doc.""


""What the hell is going on.""


Less of a question, more of a demand.

""Oh, you know,"" Bucky mutters as he begins to pace, ""Just a regular Sunday.""

""Yeah, well, does a regular Sunday include a phoned-in threat to my office?""

""Shit.""

""Yeah,"" comes Raynor's unenthused voice as she turns in her chair and clicks her pen, ""What's going on? Are you with--""

""She's helping me,"" Bucky says tightly, pinching the bridge of his nose. He purposely gives no other details, and her tone is terse, ""What did the call say?""


""Something about the Brooklyn Bridge -- and a whole hell of a lot of Russian.""


""I'm sorry,"" he says suddenly, ""For putting you in this position.""

""James,"" she says with a slight bite of ferocity, ""I'm going to have to call in the Feds. You know this. If someone is making threats on the public--""

""She's trying to,"" Bucky's fingers twitch, ""That's her play.""

Then, he hangs up.

With ease, Bucky pries out the battery from the back of his phone, and snaps the flip phone in half. Innessa would have been tracing Raynor's calls. He knows that much. She isn't stupid.

Quite the opposite.

You're busy in your own world -- his conversation is miles away in the background. You're too busy realizing this is it. That this is the moment you'd been waiting to happen. You'd thought, maybe, it wouldn't come. But that was unrealistic. Now, there's no use in panicking. The anxiety wasn't going to help.

You need to get your fucking head on straight.

There comes a point when you're standing on the edge. You can let yourself be pushed, or you can enjoy the view. You can breathe, and you can ground yourself, and you can deal with the fear when you get there. In the end, the only one who pushes you is yourself.

You know that.

Your knee stops bouncing.

""Balls in our court.""

Bucky stills in the middle of the living room at the sound of your voice.

He turns to eye you as you lift your head, and there's a ferocity in your eyes that makes his lips quirk.

""So let's kick her ass.""

You leave the safehouse about three hours after the call.

The plan is relatively simple.

Get your shit, get an eye on Sidrova, and de-escalate.

If possible, avoid getting arrested in the process.

Your apartment is the one you both pass first. It's a long walk, but Bucky is careful to check for anyone following. He looms behind you like a guard dog on the busy streets. It's crawling with cops, still, so you both just keep on walking.

Overhead, clouds roll in.

You're both in hoodies, sporting half-assembled outfits that look a little odd when you make the trek towards Bucky's apartment; the entire time it's like walking on eggshells. You duck around corners, avoid showing your faces, and Bucky makes a point of hiking up the fire escape into his own apartment rather than being seen taking the front entrance.

He comes back down with a single duffle bag.

In it, he's got a jacket, a holster, two handguns and a knife.

In that back alley, he suits up. You, as the dutiful sidekick, keep your eye on the street. It's getting dark quick. The clouds are a deep, frightening gray.

""Come on.""

He taps you to follow him, and soon you're in the garage.

He hands you the helmet to the bike, and you strap it on.

Black hoodie, black jeans, black thigh-highs boots. Not exactly a practical outfit for the sort of situation you're about to throw yourself into, but when an internationally wanted terrorist frames you and takes your own mother as a hostage, fashion isn't really the main concern.

Then, Bucky hands you one of the handguns. He sees your eyes beneath the glint of the visor. You don't look scared. You look angry. Dead-set. Like you could take on this woman all by yourself.

Part of him is proud.

""This is the safety. Flip that off, aim, and pull the trigger. Minimal kick-back. Don't flash it unless you have to.""

Then, he leans around you and tucks it tightly into the back of your waistband.

You nod as you pull your hoodie over the gun.

""Dr. Raynor said something about the Brooklyn bridge?"" you ask as you watch him muscle on his gloves.

Bucky circles the bike, moving to fold up the now empty duffle and store it quickly. The keys jingle in his hands. He spares you a look, nods, then inhales.

""If I had to make a bet,"" he says slowly, ""She already knows where we are. She dropped a line, and now she's waiting.""

You exhale.

Bucky holds your gaze.

Then, you nod.

""You have a plan?""

Bucky swings his long legs over the seat of the bike, rights up straight, and starts it. You hop on behind him. Over the roar of the engine, he turns his head to chirp:

""Sort of.""

""Care to share?""

The throttle is cranked and the bike roars.

""Just follow my lead.""

The moment you pull out of the garage, the weather has changed. There's a shift. It's colder now, the wind is combing through the trees up and down the street with angry gusts. Overhead, the clouds swirl. The streets have gone quiet, and as the two of you pull on the ramp towards the Brooklyn Bridge, the skies open up.

On that bridge, beneath the flashes of lightning and the downpour, Innessa Sidrova is already waiting for the Winter Soldier.

as always, come say hello over at whirlybirbs.tumbr.com!

In this exact moment, Bucky Barnes knows two things.

The first is that he cannot remember his mother's voice -- he hasn't been able to for years now. You forget, really, how easy it is for the sounds of someone to melt away in the waves of your mind until it's just a little too late, and then it begins to slip.

It's been nearly eight decades since he's heard her voice.

But, the moment the two of you get close enough on that bike for Innessa Sidrova to step out of the small car now adjacent to traffic, rip your mother from the passenger seat, and promptly spray oncoming traffic with a heavy assault weapon, he knows another thing: that you're angry.

It's the scream of a mother, pleading for someone not to hurt their child that glues the two thoughts together in his mind.

Innessa has carved out a warpath in the short time that the three of you have orbited one another's cosmos.

The bridge has come to a stand-still, and in the pouring rain, Bucky can see people abandoning their cars. The woman in black, dressed head to toe in leather and wearing ammunition like jewelry, stalks forward with cat-like ease. There's a gun pressed tightly to your mother's ribs, a hand digging into the back of her neck.

She looks like you. Same nose. Kind eyes. 

The bike throttle is pulled back in a gutsy roar, but Innessa keeps moving forward.

Then, the gun is raised.

She fires an almost lazy spray towards the two of you. Like she's tired of waiting, like she's gotta do the work to get you two in front of her.

Bucky feels the impact twang off the engine, and the windshield to the car to his right shatters in a burst of crystalline danger -- you wince, dig your arms tighter around him, and grit your teeth. Bucky, fluidly and with ease, jams the handlebar tightly to the side as the bike skids to a nasty stop in a small opening between cars. It's all burnt rubber, crowned with a flash of teeth in the crack of lightning.

Angry.

Bucky is angry.

Rain runs down his face. He plants a leg down. He kicks the stand down to the bike.

You throw a leg over.

Innessa keeps on walking.

""Nice of you two honeymooners to finally come play,"" she calls out loudly, roughly shoving your mother when she stutter-steps at the sight of you pulling that rain-soaked helmet off your head, ""It's awfully cute, y'know, this whole--""

Another pull of the trigger. This time, it sprays along the cars to the right, and more people go running.

""-- Sidekick thing. Never took you for the type, Soldat.""

Bucky, beside you, stiffens considerably at the viper-like hiss -- and you plant both boots down on the wet pavement with a harsh scowl. The two of you look like something out of a movie, you reason. All black and leather and soaked to the shivering bone.

Your mother winces at the clawed grip that digs into her neck.

""Hi mom.""

""You --"" Innessa's voice is different. Not how you remember it, ""Shut up.""

She's no Miss Bonnie now. No, she's traded in that personality for her true self.

Her hair, once free-floating wisps that reminded you of some Yoko Ono wannabe, is now piled in a tight ballerina-like bun. It shows you the sharp angles of her aged face -- and you come to realize you hardly knew this woman at all.

There's something funny about that. After all, you'd hardly trusted anyone in the last handful of years. The one person who you'd even considered as a friend? To apparently be some absolute piece of HYDRA work? You knew this was going to be a hot topic the next time you saw Dr. Hart.

If you make it to next Tuesday.

Your smile twitches up in rebellious spite.

""Sure, Miss Bonnie.""

The dig strikes a nerve. You almost regret it -- almost, because you can see a sudden flash of pride in your mother's eyes.

To her, you look different, too.

Not so small, not so sad. Not so terrified of the world. Hell, here you are beside... an Avenger? Flashing your hubris in the face of a woman holding a fully-loaded machine gun. You're suddenly burning so bright, it feels like she's holding a lightning strike in her palm.

And it's lovely.

Daring is a good color on you.

Innessa swings the strap back, suddenly procuring a handgun in a flash -- and with a tilt of the head, she steadies her aim between your eyes. Behind her, thunder roars.

It's Bucky's turn to aim his weapon. He's fast -- unnaturally so. The handgun is balanced perfectly in his palm and you note his cool demeanor. He's watching, trying to figure this out.

""You know there's no way out of this, Innessa.""

His tone is tight.

She snarls. ""Thanks to you, you fucking pig. Y'know, I have half the mind to put a bullet between your eyes right now... But, I don't think Andrei would be happy if I ended it so soon. No, you should suffer for what you did--""

""It wasn't my choice.""

""Bullshit,"" she spits, dropping the gun for a moment, ""I saw you. You liked the killing--""

She sees the discomfort that flashes across his face. It's like permission, like this is the cue she needed to disassemble his confidence -- it's mental chess. And Innessa Sidrova has played it for decades.

""Has she seen it?"" the barrel of the gun is flicked haphazardly in your direction, ""You? Losing your control? Turning into the dog you are?""

""No.""

""No?"" she laughs, ""No, no. No, she doesn't see the fucking monster who killed my husband. She sees this new, skinny-jeans-wearing motherfucker you are--""

Suddenly, the sound of sirens interrupts.

You turn, eyes over your shoulder. Through the rain, you can see the police cruisers nearing the center of the bridge -- their sirens wail and mingling with them is the sudden staccato of chopper blades.

A spotlight hits your eyes.

You raise a hand, wincing. The news chopper begins to circle the bridge.

The rain swirls in a hail of ice.

""Seems we have an audience!"" shouts Innessa, ""Good!""

Suddenly, the handgun is pressed firmly to your mother's temple. The little game is over, now,

She lets out a startled sound, nearly collapsing at the knees -- and Bucky reflexively moves forward.

""Ah, ah, ah,"" Innessa tuts with a colorful, maniacal sense of humor, ""I don't think so, Soldat.""

Bucky's lip curls into a snarl.

Then, curtly and without emotion, Innessa looks at Bucky and snaps a command. Her eyes snap to you.

""Shoot her.""

The whole world goes quiet.

Bucky freezes -- and then, he gets it. There's nothing else to this plan of hers. Only to drag him down the darkest part of sorrow, of loss, of grief. It's not redemption she wants. It's retribution. And he's walked you right into it. Panic suddenly crawls under his skin like fire, and he realizes he fucked up.

He should have kept you out of this.

He was stupid.


He was fucking stupid. 


When Bucky doesn't move, Innessa's temper flares -- and the gun is dug deeper into your mother's temple.

""You shoot her,"" she says, ""And you learn how it felt, or I do it. And I kill her mother, too. And we add a few more bodies to your tally. Because at the end of the day, this is all your fault anyways, isn't it? You know that, Soldat.""

There's another beat of hesitation.

You inhale sharply when Innessa's voice raises into a razor sharp scream -- and she fires off a terrifyingly close shot between both you and Bucky.

""I don't have anything to fucking lose!""

Then, Bucky turns.

The gun is raised to your face.

He tries to steady his breathing.

You realize, quickly, by the look in his eyes, that Bucky Barnes does not have a plan.

The News 7 helicopter does another pass in the dark around this live wire of a confrontation, illuminating the waves of rain and the four soaked figures -- in the bright white light, you look up.

And you see... red?

A glimpse. A flash on a high wire -- far behind Innessa, and oh so high, high, high, up.

Oh.

Alright.

You have a plan. Half a plan. More of a Hail Mary. Better than nothing, though, because you were seriously beginning to question whether you could play dead long enough to convince Innessa to give it up.

You meet Bucky's eyes once more.

This time, there's a twinkle in yours.

""Do you trust me?"" you ask, quiet and steady.

""Always,"" is his slow reply.

You give him a smile.

That's all the permission you need to break into a sprint, ramming past Bucky and unceremoniously throwing yourself off the edge of the Brooklyn Bridge.

His heart stops.

One hand on the rail, a hard push, and over your legs go. You dive headfirst into nothing but air -- and it's the most terrifying feeling in the world.

You can't even scream.

Just freefall as lightning dances around you.

But, you've lived in New York City long enough to know that flash of red. Sure enough, before a scream can even be ripped from your throat, there's something stopping you in midair long enough for a body to come crashing into yours. The air is knocked out of you, and just like that, you're flying.

Meanwhile, Innessa lowers her gun.

Her face is dead-set in irritation.


""You gotta be fucking kidding me.""


Bucky's face is split wide in horror -- but he doesn't have time to chase you down.

No, Innessa is aiming for him now; and so begins the catalyst of their story. She fires a round, sending Bucky ducking behind a car as Innessa roughly shoves your mother to the wet pavement. It gives Bucky enough time to raise his own weapon. He tags Innessa in the shoulder, earning a fed-up snarl from the HYDRA agent.

""Fucker.""

Then, Bucky watches your mom brutally kick out Innessa's left knee from her spot on the pavement.

...That works.

The woman buckles with a scream of pain, sending Bucky towards her in a flash -- but she's quick, regaining her stance by the time he collides with her, his knife in hand. She blocks, jabs, and manages to spin quickly to catch him between the ribs with her elbow. Bucky drops the knife, catching it low, attempting to swing high for her face.

Enter the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man.

And you, apparently.

""How'd you know I'd catch you?!"" Spider-man had shouted as he swung the both of you upwards.

You'd breathlessly laughed, half shrieking at the pull of gravity making you feel weightless. ""I knew he had Avenger friends!""

The landing is less than graceful, but in one of the smoothest moves since you clocked Igor upside the jaw with that baseball bat back at The Glass Cannon, you are sent into a tumbling roll -- skidding to a stop on your back, beneath Innessa with that handgun Bucky had given you out and aimed right at her face.

""Hey, bitch.""

Innessa's concentration is lost, and Bucky smiles -- then he lands a brutal uppercut to the woman's cheek.

Suddenly, the hand with the gun is stuck to the car beside her. Spider-man lands beside Bucky, leaning haphazardly against the hood.

""Hi, Mr. Barnes.""

""I'm kinda busy, kid.""

It's a gruff grumble, earned as Bucky ducks a swing -- and then Innessa's glove slips free from the webbing. She leans back, bearing her weight against the car, and plants both boots onto Bucky's ribs in a vicious kick.

Then, with wide eyes, you roll out of the way -- her own knife is now aimed for you and you tumble out of the way.

Your mother is quick to try and pull you away.

Bucky scrambles and Spider-man jumps into action. The kid is quick to tag Innessa's jacket, pulling her back and away from you, but not soon enough. She's managed to claw at your ankle, and she drags you close. The knife drags up your thigh and you scream -- only to turn to see Bucky hauling the woman up and off of you before bringing her down onto the hood of another car.

This seems like it's enough to finally take the fire out of the hellcat.

Bucky's grip is tight on her collar, face pulled into a horrible snarl.

The police have finally moved in, and from your spot on the pavement in your mother's arm, you watch Bucky regain his breath.

He beats back the rage.

Rain is running down his chin, his hair is hanging in his face. Innessa's eyes are drowned in fear -- and he realizes that she expects him to kill her. To finally end this.

But instead, his grip loosens when the Feds rush in. And he lets them haul her up, and cuff her.

""I am no longer the Winter Soldier. My name is James Buchanan Barnes, and you're a part of my efforts to make amends, Innessa Sidrova.""

Her face is set in shock.


""No--""


""Come on--"" barks a man in a dark blue jacket, one of the ones leading her back to the horde of cruisers.

""No,"" she's screaming as they drag her away, ""No, finish it! Finish the fucking job, Soldat! Do you hear me?""

He's not listening.

No, his attention is on you -- and the sudden laughter that's being peeled out of your throat as you lay there on the pavement in the rain.

""I knew you were an Avenger!"" you shout, hand raised as you point to him, ""I fucking knew it!""

Bucky's face splits into a grin.

""I'm not--""

""Wait, you aren't?"" comes a spry chirp from the arachnid themed hero to your left, ""I totally thought -- Hold on, you're definitely on the email list...""

More laughter. And Bucky, finally, hangs his head and begins to laugh, too.

Your mom, too, pulls you into a tight hug with the brightest smile you've seen from her in years. Her grip is tight. You cling to her -- and when she pulls back, you offer an apologetic smile.

""Hi, mom.""

""Hi, dear,"" she says, pushing a hand through the wet hair clinging to your face, ""Does this make you a hero now, too?""

""-- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stand up and turn around.""

Your head snaps around.

""Apparently not.""

The Feds are still there -- waiting, it seems, for you.

""What's this?"" you mom asks.

You won't lie, you sort of expected this to pass. But, looks like they've still got a job to do. You hobble to your feet, blinking between the lot of them, ""Sorry, mom.""

Bucky steps forward, brows knitted tightly. ""She didn't do anything wrong.""

""She's broken parol,"" comes the terse reply of the arresting officer, ""It's not our call, Sergeant Barnes. Take it up with the judge.""


""Oh my god--""


""Mom, it's fine--""

""This is ridiculous,"" she calls, ""She helped apprehend that nightmare woman--""


""Mom--""


The cuffs are tight as your wrists are brought behind your back and clicked in place. You can't help but still feel some elation when you look back up -- because despite how bullshit this might be, Innessa is already being loaded into a secure van and shuttled off the Bridge, no doubt heading towards her own personal maximum security cell.

You stand there for a second as they pat you down.

Bucky steps forward.

Your grin is cocky.

""Still cool with me being the sidekick?""

Then, both his hands find the sides of your face and he kisses you.

He kisses you, and you're so stunned stupid you almost forget to breathe -- because he's kissing you and suddenly the whole chaos has stopped still. Bucky Barnes is kissing you, cradling your fucking face, like you're some treasured idol, and all you can do is scramble to kiss him back before you're being hauled backwards by the officers. The two of you are pulled roughly away, and you suddenly miss the feeling of his hands on your face.

You're breathless. Gobsmacked.

Like an idiot, all you can manage is:

""Does that mean you're bailing me out?""

Bucky just laughs. His cheeks are red.

Elation is burning his lungs.

""Yeah, bunny, I'll bail you out.""

As you're shoved into the backseat of the cruiser, you're smiling.

You're carted off, away from the Bridge and Bucky and Innessa.

The rain lets up. The moon shines bright.

You're happy.

The end of the beginning of their story.

That bonsai tree looks different.

...Maybe it's you.

I mean, you're certainly different. You feel different. The last time you busied yourself with staring at that lovely little tree, Bucky Barnes wasn't an unwavering fixture in your life, you weren't some off-brand sort-of-sidekick, and up until that point in your life you'd never been shot -- so safe to say the last few weeks have changed a few things.

You weren't hopelessly in love with Bucky Barnes back then, either.

The waiting room feels smaller.

Behind the big ol' desk by the far wall, Paula plucks away at the keys of her computer -- occasionally, she'll slip a look your way with a good-natured smile. Just like usual.

(When you'd come in, she'd mentioned that she'd seen you on the news -- and it seems like everyone and their mothers had, too. That's a testament to being spotted beside both Spider-man and The Winter Soldier, you guess. When you'd finally been released on bail, you'd had a string of texts from your sister-in-law, and even a few NYU classmates.)

Dr. Hart calls your name.

You settle in, perched in your usual chair, and the silence feels awkward. The last week has been pretty nightmarish -- and even still, you feel sunny. Unstoppable.

Your disposition had definitely left Dr. Hart worried, but you'd promised that you were alright, that you'll be at your appointment on Tuesday. After all, the court hearing to determine whether or not your broken parol was warranted wasn't until Friday -- and Bucky was currently busy testifying in Innessa's case which had garnered a fair amount of public attention.

After all, everyone thought that HYDRA was snuffed out. That people like Natasha Romanov and Kiwi and the Avengers had done their job. It felt like, in a way, someone was fanning the flame of the red scare all over again. You feel bad -- Bucky hadn't exactly been thrilled when they'd called him in to testify. You knew well enough that his own anxiety around sitting in a courtroom and recounting his own personal history with Innessa wouldn't be a walk in the park.

(The fact he'd spent the morning pacing in your apartment in slacks, a dress shirt, and suit jacket said enough about how he felt.)

Yeah.

That's... Ha.

Dr. Hart clears her throat. You're pulled from your thoughts.

""So,"" she starts, ""Are you nervous?""

""For the hearing?""

""Mm.""

You swallow, shrug and let your head fall to the side. ""I'm hoping that they see reason -- that I was trying to do the right thing.""

""And what about Mr. Barnes?""

Dr. Hart watches the way you light up like a star in the night sky at the mere mention of the man. It makes her smile to herself. She reaches for her pen as you wet your lips and laugh.

""What about him?""

""I saw that little smooch--""


""Oh, c'mon--""


""Half of New York did, too, I think,"" Dr. Hart jokes, wiggling in her chair, ""That News 7 chopper had a great view of the whole thing.""

You feel hot. The embarrassment feels girlish -- and it reminds you of when Jaimie used to rib you for having a crush on his best friend in grade school. You scoff and knit your arms together tightly over your chest, an action which causes Dr. Hart to raise her brows.

""Am I making you uncomfortable?""

""No! No, I just--""

You let an embarrassed sigh.

""Me and Bucky haven't exactly talked about it,"" you mumble, waving a hand, ""Y'know, between my little 24-hour stint in jail, then my mom whisking me away -- I only saw him for a bit this morning and... I dunno, how do you even bring something like that up?""

""How about 'Hey, about that kiss?',"" she chirps, ""That's a good starting place.""

You frown. Dr. Hart smiles.

""I don't--""

""Ah, ah,"" she raises a finger, ""No second-guessing. None of it. I have seen such a huge transformation in your self-confidence in the last handful of months -- and while I don't really condone you going out and playing sidekick, I have to admit this has been good for you. He has been good for you.""

... He has, hasn't he?

 You weren't expecting anyone tonight.

That's why, when the buzzer goes off you meet it with late-night, post-take-out induced confusion. Poke even stares, lifting his head from your lap on the couch with an inquisitive little sound. Scooping him up, you're careful to place him on the bundle of blankets you kick from your bare legs. The show on the television continues to bathe the dark of your apartment in colorful light.

You press the button, hop up onto your tippy-toes, and speak into the callbox.

""Who is it?""

""It's me.""

Your heart stills. Oh. 

Without missing a beat, you hammer down the button to buzz him up and quickly rush to, at the very least, make sure your hair looks alright.

If only you'd known Bucky had been doing the same thing in the lobby window downstairs.


Christ, he needs to shave.


The door buzzes, and Bucky hauls it open. With ease, his long legs carry him up the stairs to the third floor. He's not exactly surprised to see the apartment across the hall has a hardy lock and crime scene tape barring entrance, but it does feel weird -- after all, he'd just been absorbed in the case all day.

Shifting on his feet, Bucky rolls his shoulders and comes to a stop before your door.


C'mon. 



...C'mon! Just knock.


He raises his fist, knuckles ready to rap on the bare wood, but then pauses.

Mostly because, fuck, his heart is racing.

Kissing you was maybe the worst idea he's had since he's been given a life again.

Not that it wasn't everything he'd been wanting for days, weeks, months -- not that the mere thought of the moment didn't make his century-old heart hammer in his chest like a piston engine on the brink of fiery collapse. The mere thought of the kiss is enough to send him in a tailspin. And frankly, kissing you is all he's thought about all day.

Forget breathing, forget speaking, forget fuckin' existing.

That kiss hadn't been nearly long enough.

Maybe it's a testament to the fact he's realized over the last few days how desperately he wants to be touched by you -- and how the need worsens tenfold when he even fantasizes, for a fucking second, about the feeling of your fingers on his skin in between the sheets.

...Forget it. Fucking forget it. He's a lost cause. He's doomed to eternally beat down the gnawing want in his gut to finally break in that bed in his apartment. With you, mostly. Mainly, actually.


Completely.


That's the biggest thing he's realized over the last few days.

If it's not you, he doesn't want it.

Bucky groans, dropping his head, and rubs his face one more time before pulling the trigger and knocking.

When you open the door, it's sort of like an uppercut to your heartstrings -- because there he is with his tie loosened, his jacket open, and a case of beer dangling from vibranium fingertips. You try to spur the world into turning again, but, in that moment, all you know is that you have it bad for James Buchanan Barnes.


Really bad. 


Like the sort of bad that makes every love song on the radio fit perfectly in the heart-shaped locket you wear just for him -- the sort of bad that has you counting petals and wishing on stars and whispering little dreams when the clock hits 11:11am. And god forbid you think about that kiss in the rain -- and the feeling of his hands on your face, the press of his lips. Stubble that tickles. His nose fits perfectly against yours.

You want to know how the rest of it goes -- you want to know him in every way.

In the sweet citrine burn of intimacy, too. Certainly so.

Bucky is no fucking better when you open that door. Seeing you after the hellish sort of day he had is like ice on a burn. His relief is immediate and met with a well-worn smile from a man who has seen years of a life that's no longer his.

""Hi.""

Your smile is beautiful -- and you laugh, a little huff, and drop your head as you hold the door open. Bucky mirrors the expression. His blue eyes flick along your figure, taking in the relaxed state of you. Your t-shirt swallows you whole, bare legs poking out from beneath the long hem. He fixes his posture, swallows roughly, and laughs a little.

""Hi,"" you say back, still rooted there in the doorway. Your good arm is leaned across the threshold, ""Rough day?""

Bucky whistles to himself and then rocks back on his heels. He waggles the six pack. ""What gave it away?""

There's a tenseness between the two of you that wasn't there this morning -- and you hate to say that you like it. Bucky, too, feels like he's wading into molasses and decides, almost immediately, he will happily drown himself at the cost of seeing you smile at him one more time.

He finds himself leaning on the doorframe, one arm above his head.

His expression is soft. Fond.

You smile up at him.

""Never really took you for the tie type..."" you say slowly, as you reach to run the fabric of the jet-black tie between your thumb and forefinger.

Bucky's brows raise.


Oh, we're flirting?



We're flirting.



This is flirting.


He hesitates, biting back a boyish smile. ""I mean, I'm not... But, uh, does it... Does it at least look good?""

Your smile is coy. ""Yeah. Real good, Becky.""

He almost snorts -- almost -- but he bites it back in favor of a real smile. The sight of the expression, as rare as a shooting star, makes you beam in pride. You like that you can worm one of those out of him. You like that he trusts you enough, likes you enough, to show you that softer side of him. It's endearing.

Hot.

Really hot.

He scratches the three-day-old stubble along his jaw as he laughs, and leans a little deeper against the doorframe.

""Can I be honest?""

You raise a brow. ""Always.""

""I just wanted to see you,"" he breathes out, eyes holding your own, ""And... And see Poke, of course, but... Mostly you. Always you.""

His words steal your breath.

""We need to get you a cat,"" you deflect, eyeing him up and down as you move to make room for him to come in, ""Pronto.""

Bucky laughs at the ground as he takes a long step forward. You close the door behind him. He speaks slowly. ""I saw an ad the other day on Facebook. A cute little white one. Alpine. I kinda like the name...""

You gesture for the beer, he hands it over, and stands behind you as you load the six pack into the fridge for the time being. As you do, though, you continue the conversation unaware of Bucky's horribly affectionate look and how he's completely forgotten the conversation in favor of staring at you openly.

""You gonna get her?""

""I dunno,"" he says, half there. The tension between you is like a tightrope -- and Bucky walks it. Happily.

""Why not?"" you chirp as you stuff the orange juice to the back and, satisfied, stand up, ""You're two seconds from stealing my cat, anyway.""

When there's no response, you turn around after closing the door.

Bucky's expression is still soft, like before.

""...What?"" you ask, breathy and tender, as your face splits into a dreamy little look.

Without missing a beat:

""Can I kiss you again?""

You don't know what to say.

Or do, really.

All you can do is look up at him for a long moment, swallow down the sudden flare of shyness, and nod.

The permission seems to make the golden parts of him shine even brighter; but you're not prepared for the hauntingly gentle way he steps up to you and takes your face into his hands just like that night on the bridge. The coolness of his vibranium palm kisses your cheek as his thumb graces the high slope of your cheekbone. His entrance into your personal space brings comfort, but nervousness -- because he's Bucky and he's so woundingly handsome that all you can do is stare up at him like he's promised you the world.

Your fingers find stability along his waist and intertwine in the fabric of his suit jacket.

His voice is quiet and warm. ""All I've been able to think about is kissing you again.""

His face is close, now, and you feel your smile creeping in. ""The first one wasn't nearly long enough.""

""Blame it on the circumstances,"" his nose nudges yours as his eyes flick from your lips to your eyes, ""I would have kissed you all night if I could have.""

""You can now.""

You're smiling when he kisses you again, and this time you dissolve into the moment -- you melt into his arms like the kiss Klimt pieced together all those decades ago. Golden and warm and lovely, you happy kiss him back with a tepid slowness that speaks to your contentedness in this moment.

Bucky, personally, feels like his heart could give out -- and it worsens when you wind your arms close to his chest and your nails grace the estate above his heart. It's gentle, everything is so damn gentle, that he feels like his skin is on fire.

Then it shifts.

You're the one that drags her teeth across his bottom lip, and he's the one that corners you against the counter -- and it takes the both of you, descending into this ooey-gooey tempo, to laugh through Bucky hauling you upwards into his arms and propping you up onto the quartz island. You cling to him, and Bucky flashes a pride-filled grin as you wind your arms around his neck and kiss him again.

And again. And again. And again.

Then, your nails run through his hair, and he groans.

It's enough to make you giggle -- fucking giggle for Christ's sake -- as Bucky holds your face in his hand like he did when dressing your wound in the safehouse. But, this time, it's so he can brush a horribly slow kiss to the curve of your jaw; so he can venture towards the column of your throat as you inhale sharply.

His hands, both flesh and vibranium, knead your thighs.

Your eyes flutter as Bucky nips gently at the skin -- and you squirm when he gives a throaty laugh at the way you sigh and keen.

""Sorry.""

You laugh, swallowing as his hands come to rest on your hips. You shake your head. ""Why are you apologizing?""

""M' getting carried away,"" he mutters, forehead coming to rest on your shoulder, ""Gotta reel it back in.""

It's your turn to hold his face -- to gently usher his gaze to meet yours.

For a moment, it's just you and him and no tomorrow or yesterday or fear or anxiety. Just the two of you. The stranger from the waiting room and the girl who likes the bonsai. The Avenger and his sidekick. Bucky and Rabbit. The world is quiet, and as you kiss him again, you shrug.

""You don't have to reel it in.""

He searches your face. His expression is surprised.


""...No?""


""No,"" you laugh, shaking your head, ""I mean -- if you... if it's okay with you.""

Bucky's mouth moves but nothing comes out. Mostly because, fuck, he can't even remember the last time he's had sex. Fuck. 


When...? Before deployment? Oh. Oh, Christ alive, yeah. Before deployment. 


""Is it, uh,"" he swallows roughly. His Adam's apple bobs, ""Is it okay with you?""

God, sometimes you genuinely forget how much of a fucking nerd he is.

""Yeah,"" you nudge him backwards and slide off the counter with a smirk. You snag his tie, ""Yeah, very okay.""

Bucky is dragged along, his eyes twinkling. ""And all along I thought you were a Cap girl.""

You yank on the tie, undoing it, and swat him with it. He chases the swing with a laugh and manages to sweep you into a kiss that sends the both of you stumbling towards your bedroom. Through the living room and past the bathroom, you're both entangled in a kiss the whole way.

""I'm trying to have sex with you,"" you breathe between kisses as Bucky presses you against the wall, ""And you're talking about Steve.""

He's laughing as you undo his dress shirt, so much so that he has to break the kiss to hide his grin into your cheek -- the moment it's open, you're taken by surprise when Bucky unceremoniously (and with terrifying ease) reaches to haul you up. He wraps your legs around his waist and smothers your yelp with a long kiss.

His voice is hoarse when he finally speaks. ""Can you tell I'm nervous?""

You run your nails along his scalp and he groans again -- you take the moment to nudge his nose, rut your hips, and grin.

""I think it's charming.""

""I think you're gorgeous.""

Sometimes you forget about the super-strength -- and then you're reminded, like now, when you're thrown onto your bed with such ease it seems like Bucky was lifting a feather. It's easy with him to forget who he is, because to you he's just Bucky. Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

Everything is Bucky.

He's on top of you -- his bare hand has worked beneath the t-shirt swimming on your shoulders. He touches your stomach, his fingertips skimming your ribs. His other arm props him up; you melt into the thousandth kiss of the night and fight the white hot flutter of butterflies when his hand moves to hike your leg up over his hip. The closeness is welcomed. You wind yourself closer, only before letting your hands run up his chest.

His stomach jumps.

""Too much clothing,"" he mumbles into the skin of your neck, ""Don't you think?""

""Mm,"" you nod, ""Yeah, yes, definitely.""

Bucky is quick to slap his jacket to the floor. His shirt goes next.

Fucking hell.

You just stare for a second -- and he notices. His cheeks are rosey. He clears his throat and leans back on his knees. ""What?""

""Nothin',"" you mumble, pushing up onto your elbows; you're grinning, ""Nothin' at all, Sergeant Barnes...""

It's a croon.

Bucky's face splits into a look of disbelief. ""Are you teasing?""

""Maybe--""

""C'mere, bunny,"" he chirps, grabbing your leg behind the knee and tugging you down the bed to him, ""This is a no teasing zone--""

""Isn't that half the fun?"" you mumble, worming out of your t-shirt.

Bucky's voice hitches. He swallows.

God, he's having a crisis. He hopes you don't notice the way his hands shake. You're so damn beautiful -- the relaxed sense of it all, too, has him feeling weak. You're just... you. Home alone for the night, relaxing in your pajamas. For God's sake, you can make anything look good. He's completely and utterly convinced.

""This is nice,"" he says, thumb following the band of the bralette, ""Might be nicer off, though.""

Your heart jumps. ""That was smooth.""

""I'm trying.""

You grin and sit up. ""You're doing a good job.""

He is -- and he does do a good job.

A great job.

I mean, he's pretty damn impressed with himself when he's able to get you off with his fingers alone, nevermind the handful of minutes he spends in heaven when he goes down on you. For a century-year-old war machine, he's still got some tricks up his sleeve. Mostly, it's fueled by you and the way you say his name, by the way you come undone in his hands.

You're like putty, happily writhing in the sheets when he finally kicks away his boxers and fumbles with a condom that you'd procured from your nightstand -- it feels weird for his new arm to be brought into this scenario, but Bucky's self-criticality is driven from his mind the moment you reach and lace your fingers with his vibranium ones. Gently, you drop a finger of his into your mouth, and Bucky damn near loses his fuckin' cool right then and there.


Breathe, Bucky. Breathe.


It's fine. It's fine. She's just everything you've ever wanted in a person -- kind and smart and funny and just as cynical as you and she's got pretty eyes and a nice voice and...

The fit is as good as it gets.

It's been a while since you've had sex -- and the tight ache that starts the show melts away in a handful of seconds; pain is traded in for pleasure that has you digging little half-moons into his biceps. You're going to kill him if he doesn't start moving.

You never thought, a few months ago when you saw him for the first time, that you'd be here. Beneath him, sprawled in the sheets, you huff a happy sigh when he rocks his hips gently into you.

His face is close to yours. ""You alright?""

You swallow. You nod. His eyes are full of love.

""Never better, Buck.""

Whatever composure you both hold is gone in a matter of minutes. It melts away in easy pleasure that comes from two adult who forgot what this was like -- what comfortable, caring, affectionate sex felt like. As you grip Bucky's shoulders and wind yourself tighter to his skin, you feel safe; and he reasons that he's never wanted to protect anyone more in his life.

He's kissing you, and in the dim light of your bedroom, you swear you see stars.

His hips meet yours, you gasp, and the pace begins to stutter; the white hot coil in your gut has wound tight as a spring, and all it takes is Bucky saying your name -- not Rabbit, but the one that sounds so sacred when he whispers it against your lips. Your nails dash across his shoulders, your back arches and Bucky knows he's done a good job when your legs begin to twitch in between kiss-smothered whimpers.

He's not far behind. He's chasing down the pleasure -- and when he finally comes, it's like getting shot in the chest.

It damn near kills him.

It's all you, everything is you, and it's wonderful.

In the aftermath, the best he can do is not crush you -- but he's desperate to feel you. His hands are pulling you close to his chest the second his shaking fingers discard the mess of the condom in the trash beside your desk. You're sprawled in the sheets, arms above your head, face turned to the sight of him, and eyes closed.

It's bliss.

You roll eagerly into his arms when he returns to the bed; Bucky accepts the languid toss of limbs with genuine happiness. In a pile of pillows, he's tugging the sheets over the both of you. You're happy, warm and loose. Both of you are tired.

This is nice.

You realize that you want this.

Not for tonight, but for always.

The thought comes with a bitter taste of sadness. You frown into his chest.

With a hoarse voice, you speak up after a handful of long moments.

""Bucky?""

""Mm?"" his vibranium hand is tracing the curve of your spine.

""What happens now?""

His eyes open slowly.

He sees your frown. Immediately, his heart lurches.

""Bunny,"" he mumbles quietly, ""If you think I'm gonna just disappear--""

""I mean,"" a shrug, ""I know you have things you need to do...""

""And you're my sidekick,"" he says firmly, thumb lifting your chin as he speaks, ""So lose the pout. Yep. No pouting. I need my sidekick -- she's the only person in this century that keeps me sane.""

Your sour expression breaks into a laugh.

""...You sure?""


""Promise.""


A quiet hum. You share a look with the supersoldier, then hide a slow smile into his shoulder when he leans to brace a firm kiss against your temple.

You roll onto your back.

""What about Friday?"" you ask quietly.

Bucky flops onto his back, too, and you both lay there, shoulder-to-shoulder.

""Your hearing?"" Bucky scoffs, ""Don't worry -- I've got something up my sleeve.""

You sit up, sheets falling along your chest. You give him a look.

""I hate surprises.""

""Do you trust me?""

A quiet look -- one that's half-annoyed and half-affectionate. You lay back down. Then, you turn to squeeze his cheeks.

""Always.""

He laughs.

 

Friday is met with... well, more anxiety than you've had in the last week totaled up and multiplied by ten.

It doesn't help that your mom is fussing, that your sister-in-law, Fei, is fussing, or that the baby in the carrier is picking up on the fussing and beginning to fuss herself, all while you try to find parking for your mom's car outside NYC's busiest court-house. You figure the three of you must look insane -- because mom is yelling about your lipstick while Fei tries to fix some fly-aways while juggling the carrier and you've got the damn diaper bag slung over your shoulder.

C'mon, people, let's just cross the road first. Then we can pull out the compact.


""Mom--""


""Look who's finally showed up!""

You turn around to see Kiwi on the steps, waiting with the one and only blue-haired accomplice, Climber.

""Oh my goodness!"" your mom shouts, immediately throwing her arms around Kiwi and quickly moving onto Climber, ""Suji! Ian! It's been forever, what are you doing here?""

It gives you enough time to wrangle the compact out of her hands and check your appearance. Kiwi, however, interrupts with a well-aimed punch to the arm.

""I'm a character witness.""

You snort.

The conversation is interrupted by the roar of a motorcycle engine -- and you turn to squint into the morning sun only to see Bucky on that damn bike, rolling up to an open spot right in front of the courthouse. In a flash he's cut the engine and swung his long legs over the seat; the helmet has him pushing a hand through the mess of brown tufts, and he tucks his sunglasses into his shirt.

When he sees you, he grins.

""Nice of you to show up!"" shouts Kiwi, tsking at the supersoldier.

It's your mom that rushes to Bucky first -- her new favorite person. She's obsessed with him, frankly, and more obsessed with the idea of you and him being an item. You've kept the more intimate details of your relationship on the downlow (like how every night this week -- besides last night when you'd gone home to Morristown -- he's slept in your bed with you and Poke). 

She rushes up to hug him and he's laughing, happily kissing her cheeks as he sweeps towards Fei to do the same.

Happily, he bends to coo at Naomi in her carrier.

Then, like it's as easy as breathing, he snags the diaper bag and lets you begin to decompress.

You squeeze his arm. He finds your hand and squeezes back.

""Nervous?""

""Try terrified.""

""Don't be,"" he says with a sly look, ""I like the suit, by the way.""

It's pink. A pink blazer and pink slacks. You've had it since -- god, who fucking knows -- college? It's... horribly hackrabb1t.

And you love it.

""You've got nothing to worry about,"" Bucky says as he begins up the steps, ""I promise.""

""Tell that to the judge.""

He holds the door open. You slide inside.

Kiwi, Climber, your mom and Fei follow -- and soon enough, the peanut gallery has settled into the front row of the hearing. Others are there, too, like Dr. Hart and Dr. Raynor, even a handful of federal agents who Bucky seems to recognize immediately with curt nods and waves. Your lawyer, a young woman from Manhattan with bright eyes and sharp cheekbones, greets you in the center aisle.

You take a seat at the long table before Judge Dodd.

He handled your case before -- when the GRC had sunk their claws in.

When he enters, the room stands. He offers you a nod, and you give it back.

The beginning is a swirl of formalities and charges and back and forth from your lawyer and the judge -- but the tempo is different, and when the time comes for the verdict following your violation of parole, there's a pause.

""I have a letter here.""

Your brows furrow.

Judge Dodd stacks his papers neatly against the desk before moving his glasses down his nose and leaning forward. He's an older man -- kind, when the moment calls for it. You've seen it in your own circumstance. His ruling was, by no means, cruel. And now, as he clears his throat, you can't help but wonder what the hell this is about.

""I believe it's safe to assume that everyone in this room knows who Captain Steve Rogers is.""

You can't help the way your jaw falls open.

""--And,"" he chuckles, waving the paper, ""It seems that you've made quite the impression on Captain Rogers, miss. He's written, asking for a formal pardon.""

Your head snaps back.

Bucky, in the first row, is grinning at you like the cat that got the canary.


That fucking bastard.


And, by Steve Roger's never-ending grace, it works.

You're granted a full pardon, the only remaining conditions being your work with the GRC and the mandated therapy. You walk out of that courtroom with your family -- and with a split grin that's brighter than the sun.

Bucky's laughing as you slap his arm on the steps, swatting at him with playfulness that he mirrors in a rough hug; but it quickly melts into a tender one, and you squeeze him tightly when he buries his face in your hair and mutters:

""I promised everything would be okay.""

Your smile is everything to him.

""I can't believe you.""

""Yeah, well,"" he slides his sunglasses on, ""I got a Senator I need help taking down and you're my best girl. Couldn't have them taking you away from me.""

You just stand there, shake your head, and fight the urge to kiss him.

Kiwi and Climber smile at the pair of you.

""Anything for you, Buck.""

He smiles, and for the first time ever, he realizes he doesn't regret stealing your seat in therapy one fuckin' bit."

One-word prompt: voice

""There was an accident.""

""What?! What kind of accident?"" Steve demanded. ""Is everyone okay?""

""Is yes  and  no an acceptable answer?""

""What does that mean, Tony?""

Two adorable brunette children walked into frame on the long distance video call. Two very small children with very familiar faces.

""Hi, Thteebie!"" The little boy waved and smiled, showing off the gap where his two front teeth should have been.

Steve knew that face, maybe better than his own. ""Bucky?""

""Told ya."" The boy elbowed the little girl by his side with the huge blue-green eyes in a petite, elven face. The girl raised her hand and flicked a few small fingers in a wave, then scooted behind Tony's leg to hide and peer out at Steve.  ""Thath'th Darthy! Thee'th thy. Thy. Th--""

""Shy,"" Tony interrupted. ""Darcy is  very  shy and easily startled by loud noises, so we're going to remember to use our indoor voices and tell Steve everything we remember about what happened.""

""There wath a big exthplothion, Thteebie! You thoulda theen it, pal!""

Poor Buck. That lisp was the worst. ""Can you describe what happened for me?""

""There wath a flath of light and a crath and then thomeone cried and I wath wearing a giant pair of pantth! Wif kniveth, Thteebie! Lotth and lotth of kniveth. Before that, I wath in the lab. I think I went down there to thee if Darthy could come out to play thtickball at lunthtime."" He scratched his head. Obviously, some of the details were a little soft around the edges. Asking Darcy if she could come out to play? Grownup Bucky had only just started trying to get to know Dr. Foster's lab manager. Three successful lunch dates later, Steve didn't think playing good old fashioned  stickball  was on anyone's lunchtime agenda.

""The lady pushed a button,"" Darcy whispered into the back of Tony's pant leg so low, Steve was pretty sure he was the only one who heard it.

""Which lady, Darcy?""

""The one with the Pop-Tarts. She said I could have one if I was good and quiet.""

""Darcy."" Tony clucked his tongue and bent over to lift her into his arms. He tapped her nose gently with a grease-stained finger. ""We went over this. You can have whatever you want to eat, whether you behave or not. No one is withholding food for bad behavior."" Tony cast a long, meaningful glance at the camera--at Steve. ""Which is why I'm on babysitting duty and Foster is barred from unsupervised contact with the kids. Scared this one pretty bad until she realized Darcy's memories are limited to the vocabulary and understanding of a three year old.""

""I'm five,"" the tiny imp in Tony's arms insisted, shoving all five fingers at his nose and making Tony laugh.

""And I'm thixth!"" Bucky bounced on his toes and waved, jumping to make sure he was seen and acknowledged, too.

""I assume you have a plan?"" Steve asked the engineer.

""I do, but I need to spend some time down in the labs. Darcy is an angel. Plenty of patience to sit and ask questions for hours. This one--"" He laid a hand on Bucky's bouncing head. ""Not so much.""

""I'm on my way home.""

[UPDATED 12/4/2018]This advent story has become something of a holiday tradition for me to update every December. I post updates every December now. I write for fun and I update as soon as I'm able to edit each chapter. Encouraging comments, kudos, and validation fuel my creativity and imagination. Suggestions and prompts are always welcome, though I can't guarantee every prompt will find a place in this story. If your idea meshes with my story plans, I'll do my best to work it in at some point, so don't be afraid to shout out those ideas!

Extra thanks go to MichelleLynne for pre-reading this update (and my outline) and her assurances that I'm not doing the kidfic wrong.

Suggested listening: Coming Home Part II by Skylar Grey

 

One-word prompt: home

""Buck! Tony!"" Steve called out as he entered the common room, dropping the shield and his go-bag by the door. ""Jarvis? Where is everybody?""

""In the service kitchen, sir, and if I may, welcome home.""

""Thanks, Jarvis. Yeah, I'll just..."" Steve wandered to the outer part of the kitchen off of the common room, toward the sound of pans clattering and chattering voices coming from behind the swinging service door. The door led to the commercial kitchen usually reserved for caterers and serving large events. The team rarely used it unless someone had a hankering for something baked or reheated in the oven. He peered through the pass-through window over the sink and a smile curved his lips at the sight of Tony, tiny Darcy, and his little pal, Buck, covered head to toe in dusty smears of flour, eating mini chocolate chips straight out of a trio of bags.

""Well, that's one way to combine the ingredients, I suppose.""

All three started abruptly at the sound of his voice, Tony cursing as he banged a knee on the prep table.

""Thteebie!"" The lisped exclamation preceded the bang of the door as it swung wide and a fierce hug around Steve's knees before that familiar pair of steel-blue eyes traced his legs up, up, up and widened in surprise. ""Whoa. Mithter Thtark thaid you wath a grownup, but I didn't think you'd got tho big! How'd you get tho big, Thteebie?""

""Joined the army,"" he answered with a wry twist of lips.

""Wow, that'th thwell, pal. Jutht wike your pop, huh?"" He grinned that big toothless grin and Steve melted.

""Yeah, just like my pop, pal."" He reached out to pat him on the head, halting inches before his hand touched Bucky's hair. Then, giving in to the urge, he ruffled his best friend's messy brown mop until he giggled and twisted away. Bucky's expression suddenly fell, turning more serious than he'd ever seen on six-year-old Bucky's face.

""Mithter Thtark told me we wath both grownupth--before the exthplothion--and that-- and that--"" His little lip wobbled. ""I'm real thorry about your ma, Thteebie.""

""Me, too, pal."" Steve picked Bucky up and held him close.

""Mithter Thtark thaid my ma ith gone, too."" The whispered words and sniffle in his ear were almost more than Steve could bear. Bucky hid his face in Steve's neck. ""But he thaid you'd be my famiwy now, jutht wike him and Darthy, and he'th gonna find a way to fixth uth tho we can be big again, too, thomeday.""

""Mister Stark is right--I'll be your family now, and I'm real sorry about your ma, too, pal."" Steve pressed a kiss to his best friend's head and squeezed him as tight as he dared until Tony's head appeared at the door with Darcy propped on his hip, peeking around the door frame, too.

 ""Thanks,""  he mouthed to Tony, so, so grateful for sparing him the worst of that heartbreaking conversation with his friend.

""He thaid you have a lady fwiend now, too, one that you libe wif in the towah, thometimeth. Did you get mawwied wifout me, Thteebie?""

Steve blinked rapidly in surprise at Tony, begging silently for help that was not forthcoming.

Tony grinned.

""When do I get to meet Mith Natathya?"" Bucky wiggled in his hold. ""Mithter Thtark thayth Mith Natathya'th a thuperhero and a real pretty one, too, like the fanthy ladieth in thothe paintingth at the mutheum the nunth took uth to that one time. And that thee'th a redhead.""

Delighted with the trip down memory lane, Steve spun them both in a circle and patted Bucky's butt with a resigned laugh. ""You always liked the pretty redheads, huh, pal?""

""Yuh-huh."" Bucky grinned, his tongue poking through the gap, then twisted around to glance at Darcy with a small, secret smile. ""Brunetteth, too.""

One-word prompt: bundle (look, I know this one is a reach, okay? :-P)

 

 Darcy and Bucky sat on one side of the long farmhouse table in the common room, across from the infamous, redheaded Natasha and the equally redheaded Pepper.

Bucky crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. ""Tho, we meet at watht..."" he began and Tony had to turn away, coughing a laugh behind Steve's shoulder where they stood watching the meeting from behind the kitchen island. ""Thteebie tellth me your name ith Natathya Aliabnobna Romanoba."" Nobody so much as breathed, so Bucky continued, ""That'th reawwy hard to thay.""

Steve caught the barest hint of a twitch--the beginnings of a rare Black Widow smile, before the stoic mask slipped back into place. ""You may call me Nat, if that's easier.""

""Thankth, Mith Nat."" Bucky stuck a hand across the table to shake, climbing up on his chair to extend his reach. Natasha took the offered hand gamely, flicking a glance in little Darcy's direction. Bucky remembered his manners at the silent rebuke. ""I'm Jameth Boochanan Barneth. Ever'body callth me Bucky, and thith ith my fwiend Darthy. Thee got blowed up, too. Thee's thy."" He compressed his lips, annoyed, and tried again.  ""Thy."" 

"" Bashful , if I may assist, young master Barnes.""

""Yeah, Darthy's  bathful.  Thankth, Mithter Jarvith. You're thwell."" Bucky grinned up at the ceiling.

""As always, it is my pleasure to assist you, Master Barnes.""

Clearing her throat, Pepper laid her palms on the table, smoothing away imaginary crumbs along with her rattled nerves. Steve sympathized. None of them knew a damn thing about raising kids. His own advantage ran out after acknowledging that he'd met Bucky Barnes, age six, and knew all his likes and dislikes. Beyond that ... not so much. Rapidly, Steve was developing an all new respect for his own mother who sent him out into the world every day, knowing any moment could be his sickly young self's last, or that he'd come home again with bruises, bloodied and beaten for whatever great injustice little Stevie Rogers stumbled across that day.

Parenting was terrifying. Steve would almost prefer wrangling a horde of Chitauri over a six year old any given day. Today was not that day, however...

""If I understand correctly,"" Pepper started, ""neither of you remember your adult lives at all.""

""Kinda."" Bucky waggled his hand back and forth and cocked his head as if in deep thought. ""I think I wath gonna hab lunth with Darthy when the accthident happened. I don't know what elthe I fo'got, though.""

""Darcy?"" Pepper looked at the quieter half of the pair. The little girl threw a startled glance over her shoulder at Tony, looking to him for support.

The engineer nodded and moved quickly to crouch by her side. ""This is my fiance, Pepper Potts. She's my lady friend like Natasha is Steve's lady friend. Pepper knew grownup you, too. You were going to work for her someday soon, helping her run the offices in this building and our big company. Grownup you is very smart and good at organizing people and things. No one expects you to do your grownup job right now, though,"" he hurried to reassure the little tike. ""Do you remember anything about being an adult?""

She lifted a small shoulder, but kept her eyes trained on her hands in her lap.

""Darce?"" Tony dropped his voice to an even gentler tone. ""It's okay if you don't remember, honey, and Doctor Foster isn't here right now. No one beyond this room will hear what you have to say, if you do remember. There are other more important things for all of us to worry about, anyway, like bedtimes and what kind of candy-scented bubble bath is your favorite and finding you Powerpuff Girls pajamas."" He tweaked her nose when she smiled and slid across the chair to wrap an arm around his neck.

""I like Dexter's Laboratory and Lester the Rat,"" she whispered, hugging Tony and laying her head on his shoulder.

Tony laughed. ""Lester from Beakman's World. That's my girl."" With a relieved smile, Tony patted her back and glanced at Pepper in a silent appeal for cooperation. ""We'll introduce you to Bill Nye Science Guy on the big screen later, too.""

Pepper tried a new tack. She rounded the table and crouched beside Tony. ""Hi, I'm Pepper and I didn't do such a good job introducing myself. I'm sorry about that."" She offered her hand, waiting until Darcy loosened her death grip on Tony and reached out to grab and shake her index finger. ""I don't know many kids and I might mess up sometimes, but I'll do my best to take care of you just like Tony. First things first, you and Bucky definitely need pajamas and toothbrushes for tonight. Then, we can all get to know each other better.""

""A porter has been dispatched with a list of approximate sizes, styles, and preferred characters,"" Jarvis interjected. ""I extrapolated, based on what is most popular for young boys this year and what boys born in the same year as young Master Barnes preferred, which characters the young master might prefer in the modern era for his pajamas and other garments. All-natural, dye-free personal care products and other necessities have been ordered, as well, and the kitchens are working on Captain Rogers' request for family-style dinner service in the common room for the entire team this evening. Neither Miss Lewis nor Master Barnes have any food allergies listed in their medical intake files, but Master Barnes' file may require updating.""

""No known food allergies at this age,"" Steve spoke up. ""We'll keep an eye out, though. Thanks for the reminder, Jarvis.""

""You are welcome, sir. Dinner will be served at five-thirty this evening, as an eight-thirty bedtime is recommended by experts at the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization for children of a similar age to Miss Lewis and Master Barnes.""

Chuckling, Tony tipped his head to the side and glanced up at the nearest security camera--sharing a proud look with his A.I.

""Thank you, Jarvis."" Pepper smiled and Darcy's lips curved in response. ""Then, we'll introduce you to the rest of our ...  family  in residence at dinner, and while you're getting ready for bed tonight, Jarvis and I can find the other big things."" She waved away Steve's and Natasha's protests. ""Nonsense. A few pairs of shoes, play clothes, a pair of coats, age-appropriate toys--how hard can it be?""

Steve grimaced. Famous last words, Pepper, because Steve helped Sam carry bags for Sam's sister during the back-to-school shopping trip for her three girls. Once. Only for Bucky and Darcy's sake would Steve ever offer to run that terrible, glittery pink- and neon blue-hued gauntlet again. He shuddered and glanced at Bucky--a little boy who'd never been in a modern toy store.

A little boy who was, at that very moment, tugging at something under the table. ""Hey, what'th thith?"" he asked, yanking open a velcro strap and pulling an eight-inch bowie knife from the underside of the tabletop.

Cursing, the adults scrambled, Natasha relieving Bucky of the knife while Steve started crawling around on the floor, looking under every table, chair, drawer, and box to see where the three assassins formerly in residence had stashed more of their emergency hoard. Pepper herded the children away from the growing collection of weapons bundled on the table.

""The cupboards, too--pots, pans, the storage drawer built into the stove, and the bread-warming drawer,"" Natasha called out to Tony as he ran his hand along and under the kitchen island, looking for more lethal hidey holes. Natasha asked Jarvis to request a backup gun safe for the common room when it became apparent that the armory closet on that floor would be too small to safely contain all of the found weapons Tony and Steve turned up within just the first minute or two of their search.

""What ya doin', Thteebie?"" Bucky asked, kicking his feet from his spot on top of the high kitchen island where Pepper had temporarily coralled the two kids until the room could be cleared of its nasty surprises.

Steve had to laugh. ""Baby-proofing the living room, pal.""

""I'm not a baby! I'm five!"" a tiny voice insisted.

Surprised, Steve popped up from behind the sofa. Darcy had her hands on her hips and a determined look on her face. ""I can write my name and read, too, Mister Captain Steve!""

""You are as brilliant as you are sassy, little lady."" Tony kissed her forehead. ""Baby-proofing is just a buzzword for making a room kid-friendly--safe for you to play without finding knives and sidearms under every flat surface, for instance.""

""Oh."" She settled down and scooted closer to Bucky.

Credit where it was due, Tony managed not to roll his eyes at his teammates' preparedness planning, but even Steve was a bit shocked by the sheer volume of unsecured weapons they discovered. Jarvis helpfully directed them to all known locations as the A.I. reviewed security footage of the common room.

""You know how ta play jackth?"" Bucky asked to distract and entertain his new friend.

Darcy shook her head 'no'.

""That'th okay. I can teath you."" Bucky flexed his fingers like he wanted to pat her on the leg--like he would have done with Steve when they were kids. Darcy caught the movement out of the corner of her eye and tucked her hand into Bucky's, blushing and blinking when their eyes met and they smiled at each other.

The look on Tony's face in that moment, though?

Priceless.

The response to last chapter BLEW my mind. What, WHAT? I was so worried about it, I was sure I was going to lose half of you. What even, you guys? Thanks for being awesome! All the great comments and the prompt suggestions for tiny!Bucky and Darcy are the best fuel to feed my muse. Keep 'em comin'!


 One-word prompt: eat 


 

 

Dinner went better than expected, though probably not what anyone would call 'smoothly'.

Bucky couldn't eat ninety-five percent of the prepared food and had to wait while something else was brought up from the kitchens because of his missing and loose teeth. He also had a mystery bruise forming on his elbow and scraped right through the knees of the only pair of jeans the porters brought back from Jarvis' emergency run that actually fit his sturdy little frame. Gravy fingerprints smeared the right thigh of the jeans.

Darcy didn't know how to use her knife and everyone but Tony forgot they'd need to cut her food for her. She ended the evening sitting in Tony's lap, wearing a stained grease rag from his pocket as a makeshift bib, and picking at the food on their shared plate with her fingers while Tony plied her with little nibbles of everything the kitchens sent up. The less processed the food, the harder it was for Darcy to chew with her tiny milk teeth.

Grilled porterhouse steak--no good.

Lightly steamed broccoli--nope.

Multi-grain dinner rolls--not even close.

Her eyes lit up when Tony sliced a grilled sausage link into neat little coins, then handed her a shrimp fork to spear the pieces herself.

""Kids love miniature things,"" he said with a nonchalant shrug. ""Jarvis, tell whoever's on duty for dinner tomorrow night that we'd like sliders on plain white rolls, peas or cut green beans, and those little fried potato nuggets they do at that drive-in I like in LA.""

""Tater tots, I presume, Sir?""

""That's the one.""

""I wike tatuh totth,"" Darcy said with certainty around a mouthful of half-chewed food. Tony piled up more mashed potatoes on their plate and sculpted them into funny shapes to pour gravy over and make Darcy laugh, spitting bits of sausage and potato down her front and Tony's lap.

Pepper poured herself another glass of wine and counted to one hundred.

Meanwhile, Bucky glommed onto his share of the mashed potatoes, too, and got caught flicking little blobs of them down the long table at Hawkeye with surprising accuracy. Steve laughed when Bucky suddenly stopped like a deer in headlights, catching the stern look on Natasha's face before putting down the potato glob on his finger. Glaring down the table, he pointed to his own eyes with a pair of messy fingers and turned them on Hawkeye, murmuring under his breath, ""Later, Hawkath.""

Bruce sat opposite Clint, next to Dr. Foster, who eyed the two children and Tony warily as she scarfed down her meal, said goodnight to the room at large, and hurried back to work. Thor was still away on Asgard. Blessing, curse--Steve couldn't be sure. He was more worried about what might happen if the children accidentally met Hulk, rather than the over-excitable, Labrador-like Thor.

Enthralled with Tony's potato sculpting, Darcy asked for another small pile and started in on it with her bare hands.

Then Bucky saw what Darcy was doing and had to have his own fresh scoop of potatoes and gravy to fingerpaint with.

All in all, it was a successful, if messy family dinner. Steve was reasonably sure both children had eaten enough of  something  to fill their bellies. Then Tony announced it was time for dessert. Pepper didn't entirely manage to hold in her groan of dismay.

""Watch this,"" Tony whispered to the kids as he poured a spoonful of hot chocolate sauce over a large, hollow ball of milk chocolate. It melted in a cascade away from the center, collapsing in on itself to reveal the fancy confection within, surrounded by berries covered in more chocolate sauce. Mindful of the struggle with utensils, Tony held the spoon with them as they each melted their own dessert ball, then showed the kids how to pick their dessert up with one hand and eat it like a small sandwich.

""Tony's pretty good with them; don't you think?"" Steve asked Natasha on the way back to the apartment he shared with Bucky after dinner. Though Natasha frequently spent the night, she didn't actually live with him. Yet. She was a tough nut to crack, but he had hope they'd get there someday. He was surprised when she got up with him to follow along as he carried an exhausted six year old home for the night. It was ... nice. Normal in a way Steve didn't know he'd been missing.

Natasha hummed, bumping shoulders with him, and taking hold of the fingers of his free hand. ""I think Stark knows better than most of us what it's like to be a small child at a table full of adults who've never raised a child before.""

""Mithter Thtark ith nithe. He hugged Darthy weal good when Doctuh Fothter made hew cwy, then he yelled at Doctuh Fothter that thee wath bein' an unreathonaboo athhole.""

""Buck!"" Steve barked the reprimand, shifting Bucky from his shoulder to hold him out in front a few inches. ""Your ma would wash out your mouth if she could hear you right now.""

""Jutht repeatin' what Mithter Thtark thaid. Don't wanna be caught lyin'--do I, Thteebie?"" The little brat had the nerve to grin.

""I ever told you what a cheeky punk you are, James Buchanan?""

Sucking in a sharp breath, Bucky whipped around to Natasha with a look of mock horror. ""Did ya heaw that, Mith Nat? Thteebie'th callin' me nameth!""

Natasha leaned against the doorjamb, blocking their entry. ""Is this how it's going to be?""

They shrugged together, matching smiles on their smug faces. Steve knew, even though he couldn't see it, that Bucky's cheek would dimple just so and his eyes would sparkle.

The Black Widow didn't stand a chance against six year old Bucky Barnes' charm.

She sighed and stepped aside with a shot across the bow, ""You both need to clean up your language and  you  need a bath, James. Plenty of soap should do the job all the way around."" Then she shoved them in the direction of the bathroom and announced she was going to track down pajamas for Bucky to wear after his bath. Under her breath, she told Steve to take his time so she and Jarvis could clear Bucky's room of weapons.

As he started filling the tub (and holding onto a griping, squealing Bucky one-handed), he heard Natasha ask Jarvis to remind Pepper that they'd need to do a sweep of Darcy's apartment, too, in case she unexpectedly returned to it as a child rather than the arranged guest room in the penthouse. It was a good idea and plain good sense. Natasha looked at the whole picture and saw the potential for things to go south. If Clint could get anywhere in the tower by air duct, so could a pair of small children. Actually, they might find some new way around that the larger duct-crawler had missed.

""Aw, Thteebie, come on, pal. Not a baff!"" Bucky started wriggling the moment they stepped over the bathroom threshold and didn't stop until he was half-drowned in a lakeful of apple-scented bubbles, soaking Steve up to his armpits.

""Try to remember how much this sucks for both of us the next time you're flinging handfuls of mashed potatoes and gravy at spies across the dinner table,"" Steve grumbled, trying to pin Bucky down to pour a cupful of clean water over his shampooed hair.

""Mithter Hawkeye'th a thpy? Like in da nickel nobbelth?"" Bucky's soapy eyebrows shot up in surprise. ""Jeeperth creeperth, Thteebie! That'th neat!""

""Yeah, real neat. Next time, he's the one scrubbing all the crap--""

In the other room, Natasha cleared her throat. Loudly.

""--all the dried stuff off of you afterward.""

Holding up a pair of purple and blue plaid flannel pants and a shirt with a bunch of crazy cartoons on it, Natasha stood in the doorway and asked, ""How do you feel about Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends?""

""I wike it jutht fine ath long ath it'th any Fothter but mean Doctuh Fothter from da lab."" Bucky shrugged and continued to pile up bubbles at the front of the soaphawk he'd fashioned on his head.

The rest of bathtime was subdued as the adults considered Bucky's strong feelings about Dr. Foster and Bucky continued smearing wads of bubbles everywhere Steve washed them off. Eventually, though, Bucky consented to a warm rinse-off with the handheld shower head. From parts unknown, Natasha procured a child-sized Captain America hooded towel. The hood looked like Steve's cowl and kept falling over Bucky's eyes. He grinned and giggled and made silly faces behind it as the adults worked to dry him off.

When they were done, Steve cleared his throat. ""You're still pretty upset with Dr. Foster, Bucky. You wanna talk about it before bed?"" he asked as he took the tiny Hulk underpants from Natasha and held them out for Bucky to step into. Then the flannel pants, and finally, the T-shirt.

It took Bucky a few tries to get his head through the neck hole instead of one of the armholes because he tried to talk and get dressed at the same time. ""Nah, Mithter Thtark took cawe of it. Jutht didn't exthpect ta thee 'er again tho thoon at dinnew. I'll twy ta 'membuh my mannerth bettuh nextht time, Thteebie. Pwomithe."" He crossed his heart and held out his pinky.

""What's that for?"" Steve asked.

""It'th a pinky thwear. Darthy taught me."" Bucky hooked his pinky with Steve's and shook them up and down. ""It'th WAY better than thpittin' in ya hand ta make a pwomithe, that'th fo' thure,"" he said before climbing into the big bed Steve pointed to.

""You want a book or anything, pal?""

Bucky's brows drew together. ""You know I can't wead, Thteebie. The nunth thaid we don' wearn that til nextht yeaw.""

""Right, right... I forgot. Umm..."" Steve looked around his best friend's spartan bedroom, a smile lighting briefly on his lips when he spotted the Bucky Bear gifted to grownup Bucky by Sam as a joke on the bureau. ""Grownup you doesn't keep any kids' books handy. Uh, I can check my room...""

""If I may--"" Jarvis interrupted. A children's' interactive storybook hologram appeared on the far wall.

""Hey, I know this one! We'll have to watch the movie after we finish the book."" Steve settled down on the bed with his back to the headboard by Bucky's side and started reading,  ""Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much..."" 


FUCK CANON, YO--FRIGGA LIVES. Also, here, have some plot and tears, and tiny!Darcy, and a blushing Tony, along with a heaping helping of 'what the fuck is Jane's problem?'--RESOLVED.

 One-word prompt: red

 

 

In the morning, Steve found a pair of shopping bags, overflowing with durable little boy clothes and a half dozen boxes of shoes in different styles sitting outside his apartment door. A pair of the tower's porters stood nearby, waiting for the go-ahead to store Sgt. Barnes' king size bed and frame and replace them with a top of the line loft bed. A note from Pepper (on behalf of herself and Jarvis) said the loft bed gave Bucky the best of both worlds: the top bunk with a safety rail and more floor space to play in his bedroom.

After a quick perusal of the bags' contents, Steve outfitted Bucky for the day in a fresh pair of blue jeans, an unbranded baseball tee, and a pair of tiny Converse in fire engine red.

Insisting he could do it himself, Bucky tied his own shoes and, while he was distracted playing with his new electric toothbrush, Natasha tightened up and double-knotted the loops. Afterward, she offered to take Bucky up to the common room for their turn at table-setting duty while Steve dealt with the deliveries. While he helped uncrate the new frame and piece it together, Jarvis confirmed that Clint and Pepper cleared Darcy's apartment overnight of all adult paraphernalia, tasers, knives, and everything Jarvis thought might be questionable if discovered by a small child. Not that Darcy was expected to return to her apartment before they reversed the results of the lab accident, but an ounce of prevention, as they say...

""How is Darcy doing today, Jarvis?"" Steve had no idea why he felt the need to make conversation with the A.I., but being around the porters always made him feel awkward, and he needed to fill the silence with inane chatter.

""Miss Lewis ... had a difficult night. As with anything new, I assume there is an adjustment period to be expected.""

Digesting the cautiously optimistic status report, Steve inquired, ""Anything I can do to help?""

""Miss Potts has an unavoidably full morning, but Sir could, perhaps, use an extra pair of hands for an hour or two so he can rest his eyes for a bit.""

""Did he sleep at all?""

""Very little, I'm afraid.""

""That bad?""

""Miss Lewis was in some distress throughout the night. We are both learning and the Stark family doctor has been summoned to look over both children this morning, if you will agree to have the doctor check young Master Barnes, as well.""

""I appreciate that. Thank Tony for me, Jarvis?""

""Of course, sir."" There was a pause. ""The porters have finished and Agent Romanov reports breakfast is served. You are to move your rear, so to speak, or young Master Barnes will have your bacon.""

Steve chuckled. ""Thanks, Jarvis. Tell her I'm on my way.""

A few minutes later, though, he walked into a scene like nothing he expected.

Bucky sat on the counter, sniffling in Natasha's arms. Pepper's eyes were red like she was trying not to cry and Bruce stormed out, looking much too green around the edges for safety's sake as Steve stopped in the middle of the room. Perched on top of the fridge, Clint had murder in his eyes, a knife in his hand and at the ready.

Bawling in Tony's arms, Darcy all but gagged on the thumb she had jammed in her mouth. Her face was flushed with splotchy red patches and her limp hair stuck to her forehead. Tony looked like hell, too. His eyes were watery,  bloodshot with dark circles like he hadn't slept in days rather than a single rough night with a clingy five year old. He had Darcy zipped up inside his hoodie with her legs hooked over his hips while Pepper tried to slip a set of noise-canceling headphones playing soothing music over the little girl's ears.

""Wh...?"" Steve didn't know where to begin trying to find out what happened. Everything was fine five minutes ago!

Without a word, Tony gestured to the big screen in the living room. The scene from the accident in the lab the previous day looped over and over again; the moment before the screen turned to static snow, a flash of something dark and red expanded like a gaseous cloud between Dr. Foster and Darcy. Both of them looked furious, like they were in the middle of a heated exchange, but Foster's eyes were black, the whites no longer visible, and strange red lines snaked across Foster's skin. Milliseconds before the screen blacked out, Bucky dove in front of Darcy, grabbing her by the shoulders and partially obscuring her from the full blast of whatever the hell went down that day.

""What is this?"" he asked, approaching the screen, drawn to it as if he needed to trace the lines on the doctor's skin to understand what they meant.

""We figured out why Darcy didn't want to talk about the accident or her adult memories,"" Tony explained. ""She started crying in her sleep last night about the darkness and dark elves.""

Sniffling, Pepper tucked Darcy's lank curls inside Tony's sweatshirt. ""She begged for her blankie and wouldn't stop crying about the darkness. We thought it was just a recurring nightmare, but Tony asked Jarvis to play the footage from the accident while Darcy was helping Natasha and Bucky in the dining room just now. She heard Dr. Foster's voice and, before we knew what was happening, she was standing in front of the screen, shaking and screaming about the darkness again--like last night.""

""Foster had a run-in with the Aether--the Reality Gem--in London,"" Tony murmured. ""Darcy was there. We talked about it once. What being in its presence did to her. She knows what Darkness looks like."" He took a deep breath and still looked like he might crawl right out of his skin.

""Where's Foster?"" Steve demanded. ""It's time we got some concrete answers.""

Whimpering, Bucky turned his face into Natasha's neck when another video began to play, the sound off this time, captions splayed across the bottom of the screen. Natasha ran soothing hands across his back, reassuring the little boy in her arms as she murmured to him quietly.

The new camera angle showed Foster on the roof of the tower at what appeared to be dawn, screaming at the skies for Heimdall to send Thor or anyone who could help. ""I think I did something terrible and I can't fix it!"" she shouted. ""I can't even remember it!"" she raged, hands buried in her hair, maddened eyes swirling black until all traces of light disappeared. Trails of the same red miasma twisted up her arms and neck, then temporarily disappeared in a flash of light. Standing on the helipad in the background, the Warriors Three and Lady Sif stood armed and ready for battle. In silence, the warriors known as Hogun and Fandral escorted Foster to the center of the great bifrost sigil, returning from where they came in another burst of blinding light.

""I return to the prince's side. Bring good news when you have it."" Volstagg saluted Lady Sif, disappearing in a second flash of light.

""Guardian Jarvis?"" Lady Sif called out.

""Yes, Lady Sif?"" came the reply.

""Please inform the Avengers of Midgard that Dr. Foster is in the custody of Asgard, being treated for her condition. We are aware of the event that occurred in your Halls of Science. I shall return with one of our Elders to see to the children and repair the damage done here.""

""I will pass on the message, gladly. Thank you for your assistance, Lady Sif.""

""Before I depart, I would know-- The children are well? Heimdall only briefly described what transpired in your Halls of Science before delivering us in dispatch of our duties. Thor will worry for Lady Darcy's well-being especially. I would bring news, if there is aught to report.""

""She suffers frequent nightmares and has difficulty sleeping. She's frightened, in a strange place with strange people.""

Lady Sif closed her eyes, her sword arm dropping as a range of emotions crossed her face. ""I'm sorry to hear it. Please give her our love. I will return with help,"" she repeated, lips firm in a determined line, then disappeared in another burst of light.

""We have visitors,"" Jarvis announced as the video feed ended and both the elevator doors and the balcony doors opened simultaneously.

From the elevator, an elderly, Asian gentleman with snow-white hair and wire-rimmed spectacles entered the room, immediately homing in on Tony and the troubled children. The other visitors, clad in clothing reminiscent of Asgard, waited patiently on the threshold to the room.

""Anthony, you haven't gone and started a family without telling me,"" the old man demanded in kindly fashion.

""No--have you?"" Tony asked with a wry smile.

The old man waved him off with a laugh. ""And my Ben would--what? Give up his car collection for a minivan full of booster seats in our old age? Not likely.""

During the exchange, Tony's face relaxed and Steve felt something tight and strained loosen within himself. On top of the fridge, he saw Clint relax by degrees, too. Pepper crossed the room to welcome their off-world visitors while the others watched their human guest with wary eyes.

""So then, what? You worried our last visit didn't take, Doc?"" Tony quipped, sliding a hand up Darcy's back in a soothing gesture.

""I may not perform many vasectomies, but I do a thorough job, young man, and I do it well."" He tapped Tony on the nose with a familiarity Steve had never seen Tony engage another person. ""What I didn't expect was to read about your vasectomy in Vanity Fair, after the deed was done."" He raised one distinguished brow and Tony laughed.

""Doc Lin."" Tony kept his voice down as he introduced their guest to his charges, ""this is Darcy and that's James. Who they are is a lot harder to explain.""

""Why don't you start at the beginning while I look over this young man?"" He leaned over and peered into Bucky's tear-stained eyes. ""If that's okay with you, James.""

The little boy sniffled and buried his face in Natasha's breasts. Steve really, really hoped Jarvis was getting video footage for later. The home movie nights would be fantastic for years to come, he thought with a small smile.

""You've had an upset. I'm sorry to hear that,"" the doctor said to Bucky as he pulled up a barstool after Tony explained the circumstances of the lab accident and what they thought they knew. ""Would you like to talk about what happened?""

Bucky shook his head 'no', burrowing deeper until Natasha grunted from the force of his nose against her breastbone. ""Thorry, Mith Nat,"" he muttered, turning to face the doctor.

Natasha gave him a squeeze. ""You worry too much for a little boy, James,"" she murmured into his messy hair, resting her cheek on his head.

""Da uv'er doctuh yelled at Darthy and thcared hew,"" he whispered. ""An' me, too,"" he finally admitted.

""I'm a different sort of doctor altogether."" Dr. Lin assured him. ""Did you know I was once Mr. Stark's pediatrician?""

Bucky blinked. ""Ithn't that a baby doctuh?""

Dr. Lin nodded. ""Yes, I also delivered Anthony many, many years ago at Stark House, just a few blocks from here in the city.""

""Mithter Thtark wath a baby?"" Bucky asked with wide eyes.

""Mm... Yes, and quite a handful sometimes."" The doctor laughed.

The sniffles dried up and Bucky scooted closer to the doctor. ""I'mma han'ful, too,"" Bucky stage-whispered.

The doctor gasped. ""You don't say?!""

Bucky threw his head back and laughed. Natasha joined in, laughing and running a hand through Bucky's tousled hair. Their remaining tension melted away as the doctor continued to ask questions meant to put Bucky at ease. While they got to know one another (and trusting Natasha implicitly to see to Bucky's needs), Steve drifted to the other conversation underway in the living room.

An Elder Aesir woman with long, curling blonde hair coaxed Darcy out of Tony's hooded sweatshirt into an oversized, red garment. ""My son sent this for you with his apologies,"" she explained. ""He's so very sorry he forgot to leave it on Midgard when he departed.""

""Is this..."" Pepper paused. ""Is this Thor's ceremonial cape?""

""Indeed it is."" The Elder wrapped the little girl up expertly in the royal raiment. ""One of his favorites. I put a little something extra special in it just for his darling friend, Darcy."" Her fingers traced a line of protective sigils Steve recognized from the designs on Mjolnir.

Darcy pushed the headphones up out of the way as she scrambled to get a hand back on Tony's neck. ""You're..."" Her little brow furrowed. ""I knowed you,"" she said as if remembering, the tips of her fingers ghosting down the woman's cheek.

""I listen often for your prayers,"" the woman subtly shifted the subject away from Darcy's memories. ""What has happened to you and your young friend--this was accidental seidr. Uncontrolled potential in the hands of an untrained novice. The doctor, Lady Jane, once came in contact with a dangerous relic not of this realm. She meant you no harm, but a trace of the relic remained within her, dormant, awaiting an opportune confluence of events to reawaken. She deeply regrets the harm caused here and begged me to attend you to ascertain if I might help.""

""Will you undo it?"" Tony asked, tightening his hold on Darcy.

""It isn't as simple as 'undoing' a known spell, I'm afraid. This is unskilled seidr--the combination of science and magic, as you would call it. These types of spells simply draw to an end when they are no longer effective, or the need which generated the original, accidental spell ceases to exist.""

Tony stared at their guest, puzzling out the meaning of her words. ""You think this happened for a specific reason.""

""It's possible, yes,"" she agreed. ""I will consult with the Norns to be sure, but I suspect this is a result of some unresolved problem or problems faced by the people affected most.""

""Because I yelled at the lady?"" Darcy whimpered.

""No, darling. More likely you needed something that was revealed in the heat of the moment, some thought or feeling or unfulfilled desire that could only be accomplished through this act of seidr."" She pushed aside the shoulder of Tony's sweatshirt, to reveal a dark, thick strap. ""This--you've already begun to fill this need for your young friend.""

""What is that, Tony?"" Steve asked.

His interest piqued when Tony blushed bright red to the tips of his ears and tried to disappear into the shadows of his hood. He cleared his throat. ""Jarvis and I did some research last night. Darcy exhibits a lot of self-soothing behaviors--sucking her thumb til it bleeds when she's nervous, inconsolable crying for her blanket after a nightmare, clinging to the only adult she trusts or assuming no one will help her when she truly needs it--all subtle signs of neglect. And I knew a little of Darcy's history--from before. There's a parenting movement that opposes the cry-it-out method--attachment parenting, babywearing, co-sleeping. It's supposed to be responsible for increased IQ and improved language skills, too.""

""As many as twenty to thirty IQ points,"" Jarvis added helpfully.

""This is a good start--a wise choice to fulfill your friend's need, Anthony,"" the older woman assured him.

The woman--Frigga, she called herself--helped settle Darcy in Tony's sweatshirt--inside the sling carrier strapped across his chest. Darcy's thumb slipped from her mouth. She rubbed the silky edge of Thor's cape with her finger and damp thumb. ""Thank Mister Thor, please, Mrs. Frigga.""

""Certainly,"" the woman agreed, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Darcy's hair and another to Tony's cheek. She whispered something, too--an incantation, maybe, because a soft glow emanated around them for a moment. ""Just a bit of help so they'll get some much needed rest,"" she assured Steve who smiled in genuine gratitude.

As Frigga made her farewells, promising to return after speaking to the Norns, Bucky and Natasha hurried over to join the others. Clint handed a small bundle over to Bucky and called him a good egg. If only Barton knew...

But Bucky surprised him again. Holding the bundle up to Frigga, he asked a question too low for Steve to hear. When she nodded, Steve got a peek at what was in the bundle--the Bucky Bear from Sam. Thor's mother placed a hand on the bear's head. It glowed a soft golden-pink, then Frigga was gone and Bucky hauled an exhausted Tony by the hand over to the inside corner of the large sectional in the living room.

""Polarize the balcony windows and dim the lights ninety-six percent, Jarvis,"" Pepper requested as Tony settled on the sofa with Darcy.

Bucky scrambled up beside them, tucking himself into Tony's side and holding out the bear. ""Ith fo' Darthy. He'th mah Bucky Beaw fwum mah fwend, Tham, fwum when I wath gwowed up. Mith Fwigguh put the whammy on 'im to help Darthy hab no mo' nightmaweth.""

Tony's arm fell across Bucky's shoulders and pulled him in close. ""Clint's right. You  are  a good egg, kid.""

one-word prompt: snowflake

The first time he woke up, it was to the tickling sensation of baby-soft hair rubbing his cheek. Without conscious thought, Tony turned his head, seeking the source of warmth and the light, floral female scent he'd know anywhere--even in the half-space between wake and sleep.


 Pepper. 


Breathing deep, he opened his eyes and she was right there, head canted to the side, her face inches from little Darcy's, both of them nuzzling Thor's plush cloak. They were a disheveled, lovely mess, hair sticking up in every direction, faces puffy from the overwrought start to their day and the long night before.

Was it weird that he'd never felt more at home?

""It's snowing,"" a voice murmured.  Clint.  ""You need a ride back to the hotel?""

""No, no. Don't go to any trouble,"" Doc Lin replied. ""I'll stay a while yet. Jarvis will call me a driver when I'm no longer needed. You go on. Thank you, though, Agent Barton.""

""Tell Jarvis to give a yell if you need anything. I'm covering Steve's meetings this afternoon, so I'll be downstairs all day. Banner's taking Pepper's schedule--the essentials. Pepper's PAs rescheduled everything else for her and Tony.""

""It's a pleasure to know Anthony has such good friends, Agent Barton. Thank you.""

""He'd probably argue, but we're more family than friends."" Clint chuckled. His voice drifted closer. ""Especially now.""

""Well, it's still appreciated,"" the doc reiterated, going quiet when Darcy shifted and murmured into Tony's chest.

The second time Tony woke, the light had shifted to that of early afternoon. Looking around the room, the sight of Rogers and Romanoff stretched out on the long end of the sectional almost made him laugh out loud. Romanoff had all but disappeared under the super-soldier's bulk with little Barnes draped over his back, snoring and drooling on Rogers' neck.

""Pictures, J,"" he reminded his A.I., then tightened his hold on Darcy and Pepper, and drifted off again.

The next time he woke, mini Barnes' butt was pressed against his hip. The kid wriggled and snickered, and was definitely up to no good.

""Whatcha doin', kid?"" Tony whispered to avoid waking Darcy.

""Tyin' Thteebie's thneakerth to Mith Nat'th.""

Heh. Excellent. This Barnes was Tony's kind of sneaky little shit. Still, though--adulting; he had to do it. ""Why?"" he asked for good form.

The pint-sized troublemaker turned a sparkling grin on Tony and shrugged. ""Why not?"" His little tongue poked through the gap when he smiled.

Tony tried not to laugh--he did, but there was something in that smile he couldn't resist. And maybe a little bit of what he figured Steve saw in the one-time assassin--before war and strife and ice and time.

""It's late. D'ja eat yet?"" Tony made an effort to get his bearings.

""Doc Win made me a toathted cheethe thammich with tomato thoup,"" Bucky assured him.

""Good, good."" Working a hand free from the folds of Thor's cape, Tony ran it through his greasy hair. Christ, what a mess. ""Listen kid, we haven't had a chance to get much done around here. If you're bored--""

""Mithter Jarvith taught me how to uthe the Netflixth. I watthed a thow about the moon landin'. Tho neat!"" he tried to whisper-yell.

""Still..."" Tony shook off the dregs of sleep. ""We'll do better. Tomorrow, we'll ... I don't know ... do something fun in the workshop. Learn stuff. 'kay?""

"" 'kay,"" Bucky agreed readily. ""Can I help build robotth an' thtuff?""

""That depends. Can you behave yourself around power tools and blow torches?""

""No.""

Tony laughed. ""I appreciate your honesty, James Buchanan Barnes, and I like your style. Yes, you can help.""

The final time he woke in the common room, Darcy patted his cheek, whispering, ""Tony, I gotta go real bad.""

""I'll take her,"" Pepper's sleepy voice offered.

In the kitchen, Bucky laughed uproariously at something Doc Lin said.

Steve and Natasha woke with a start and promptly fell off the couch in a heap of flailing limbs and tumbling curses in a mixture of English and Russian.

Darcy's tiny laugh could be heard right before a hurried, ""Uh oh--Miss Pepper, I really gotta go!""

A door slammed and Tony sat up just as Bucky clambered up over the back of the couch to cackle at the results of his handiwork. He held up a hand which Tony promptly high-fived. ""Well played, kid.""

Today's one-word prompt was provided by Musichowler. 

Thanks go to chimyra and MichelleLynne for pre-reading and weighing in on this chapter while it was still under construction. 

*I shamelessly borrowed one of my favorite lines from a Christmas movie for this update, too. *wonders if anyone will spot it* 

Suggested listening: ""How to Save a Life"" by The Fray

One-word prompt: hugs

""That'th Mithter Hawk?"" Bucky scrambled up onto the ledge and pressed his face to the shatterproof glass, leaving nose, lip, and tongue prints Tony could only be grateful were not his responsibility to scrub off later.

""No, 'HULK',"" Clint corrected.

""That'th what I thaid!""

""That's still Dr. Banner, not Hulk,"" Steve pointed out. ""And this is a really terrible idea.""

""It's really not,"" Tony insisted, eyeing Steve over Darcy's head. The entire group stood behind the observation window of the Hulk-out room, including a curious Dr. Lin who'd agreed to remain in the city and on-call at Tony's request, for the time being. ""We can't reasonably prepare the kids for a real-deal emergency or hold a fire drill or show them how to get into the panic rooms during an attack on the tower, and ignore the great big green elephant in the room. You saw what nearly happened yesterday. And that was just day one, Rogers. What happens if we can't reverse their age regression right away? Or if it takes months or years to wear off? They're going to meet Big Green sooner or later, one way or another. Better under controlled conditions where we can explain the science and Hulk isn't, you know--extra-smashy, right?"" He turned back to the window as Bruce moved to the center of the room in his super-stretchy, comfy Hulk pants.

""Doeth he glow wike Mith Pepper thowed uth?""

""No, Pepper is the only one ... in our family with a version of the serum that makes her glow."" Tony explained. ""Dr. Banner changes all over--like the video we watched on the big TV of Steve's transformation inside the Vita-Ray chamber, but Dr. Banner gets very big and turns green when he becomes our friend, Hulk. Hulk is ... different. He doesn't think like Dr. Banner. He's still learning how to speak, a lot like you and Darcy. His vocabulary will grow as he gets older.""

Darcy's little fingers pinched Tony's neck and she asked in a shaking voice, hugging her new Bucky Bear extra close, ""Does it hurt Dr. Bruce?""

Taking over from there at the pleading look in Tony's eyes, Steve answered, ""Maybe a little bit, but not for very long. It'll make him tired later, and very hungry.""

""Like you get hungry and eat lots and lots?"" she asked.

""Yes, kind of like me, but I'm hungry almost  all  the time. Dr. Banner is only very hungry after he changes back to himself. The busier and more active Hulk is during ... playtime, the hungrier Dr. Banner will be afterward.""

""It's important to remember--"" Natasha joined the discussion, ""--that Hulk should be treated just like any new friend you meet, politely and with respect. Seeing Dr. Banner transform into Hulk the first time can be unsettling and that's a very normal reaction, but it's important to remain calm so we don't frighten  him , either. Okay?"" She stared at the back of Bucky's head until he felt her burning gaze and turned around.

""Yeth, ma'am,"" Bucky nodded, tucking his bottom lip in under the top, making his eyes big and round and innocent.

""Does that look ever work?"" Tony asked.

""Thometimeth."" Bucky smirked and shrugged. Then a thought appeared to occur to him. ""What doeth Mithter Hawk wike ta eat?""

""I'm not sure what his favorite food is, but you can ask him yourself in a few minutes, if you like."" Tony waited for Bucky to settle down while Darcy's little legs squeezed him almost to the point of pain around his middle. She was very nervous. He patted her rump through the padded sling and whispered quiet reassurances in her ear as Barton and Romanoff entered the Hulk-out room to flank Bruce in relaxed positions, at ease and loose-limbed--the only way the team could think of to show the kids there was nothing to fear from the Hulk, no matter how intimidating he might look after the change.

Darcy's nerves proved contagious, pushing Bucky to climb Steve like an oak tree, clinging to his back, arms tight around his neck. He watched with wide, fascinated eyes as Bruce transformed from mild-mannered doctor to Big Green.

Sucking in a shocked breath, Darcy trembled and pulled her legs up and into the sling. The toes of her little sneakers dug into Tony's ribs, but she kept her cool, mimicking Tony and Steve as they took deep, exaggerated breaths, too. Tony felt rather than saw Pepper's approach, her skin warm with the Extremis active in her system.

She held a hand up, glowing a low amber color. ""It's a physical change--just like mine. I'm still Pepper, but I'm a little stronger and more durable like this. Bruce changes a little more than I do, but he's still in there,"" Pepper crooned the reminder. Tony had to give her credit--he'd never seen Pepper so at ease about her use of Extremis. She was really making an effort to help smooth things over for the kids and he loved every glowing, pretty part of her for it. He loved Darcy like the snarky, little sister he never had even before the lab accident--shared life traumas and all that, but those feelings had only deepened since her overnight change to  extremely  little sister. Thank god for Pepper and her ability to roll with the punches.

Hulk lumbered closer to the observation room and peered through the window with a curious lift of brow. ""Brony,"" he said with certainty, thumping the window with a stubby finger and grinning at his friend.

""Brony?"" Steve asked, coughing on an aborted laugh.

""We're Science Bros. I'm  Tony.  He's an enormous green good guy machine. He gets to pick the nicknames."" Tony switched his attention to the kids, testing the waters to gauge how they were processing the change in Bruce. ""Pretty cool, huh?""

""Wow, he'th gween.""

""We told you he'd be green. It's no big deal,"" Tony bluffed. ""Lots of people are green.""

""Name five,"" Darcy piped up.

The room burst into raucous laughter.

""I knew  our  Darcy was still in there,"" Tony teased, tickling her ribs, making her giggle and squeal.

When she settled against his shoulder, breathless with laughter, she relaxed her death-grip on his neck and slid her legs around his middle again.

Tony asked, ""Would you like to say hi and introduce yourself?""

They watched Hulk look around to make sure no one was too close, then plopped down on his butt right there on the other side of the window to watch and wait for the kids to come say hello. He wiggled his big green toes and made hysterical faces at his reflection in the glass. A range of expressions crossed his face that surprised a giggle out of Bucky. Darcy seemed particularly fascinated by the toe-wiggling and the way he grunted responses at Romanoff and Barton when they tried to engage him in conversation.

""Can he come out to play?"" Darcy finally asked and Tony knew it was going to be okay, as odd as the request might have seemed to someone who hadn't befriended the Hulk.

""Usually, when he comes out to play, he sticks pretty close to his Hulk-sized room. It's a playroom we built special just for him where he can smash and play and make as much noise as he wants.""

Darcy looked thoughtful for a moment, then asked, ""Can we go in and play with him?""

""Wait, wait, wait..."" Bucky took one appalled look at Darcy, then eyeballed Steve, as if to say,  ""I can't believe there are two of you crazy numbnuts in this world."" 

But Darcy was already shimmying out of the sling and tucking her Bucky Bear into her backpack. She hitched Thor's cape up over her shoulder as best she could and pushed her backpack into Tony's arms. ""Hold this,"" she demanded, then marched into the Hulk-out room, Thor's cape trailing regally in her wake. ""Come on, Bucky, it'll be okay."" She held a hand out as she passed through the door and waited until Bucky caved, grabbing her hand and following her into the room.

Laughing, Tony realized he was left holding another of the world's great ladies' purses as she marched right up to fear and looked it in the eye.

""Nice to meet you, Mister Hulk,"" her little voice rang out in the echoing space. ""I'm Darcy. This is my friend, Bucky. Do you wanna play?""

""HULK NOT KNOW."" The big guy shrugged.

Head tilted, Darcy considered his answer with care. ""Don't you know how to play?""

Hulk shook his head.

""Whatta ya wike ta do?"" Bucky worked up the nerve to ask.

Another shrug.

""I wike ta eat and cwimb thtuff,"" Bucky tried again.

Hulk blinked.

""And I like Jarvis and music!"" Darcy added with just a touch of forced enthusiasm. ""Me and Tony and Jarvis listen to it lots. And I like classic rock and pop and R&B and jazz and 90s alternative and 80s power ballads!"" She fist-pumped in excitement and Hulk threw his head back, laughing his deep belly laugh. Darcy climbed right up into his lap and started telling him about the great 80s bands Jarvis taught her all about.

""She gets that from Barton's side of the family,"" Tony insisted to anyone still listening, but all Pepper did was smile like someone who knows something she's not telling.

""Sure she does, honey.""

Inspiration: this natatorium

One-word prompt: alone

Darcy hated baths.

Which wasn't such a big deal, except that Tony hosed her off in the bots' autowash in the shop the last few days--ever since her meltdown when Pepper tried to carry her into the shower instead of the bathtub since she  clearly  despised the bathtub. (Tony had never seen a temper tantrum before and he never wanted to see one again, so the bathtub was fucking  out  and that was that, as far as he was concerned.) But the autowash wasn't meant for kids and Darcy was getting a little funky around the edges. Dr. Lin was no help. He said Tony would figure it out and Darcy wouldn't perish from her own stink in the meantime, but Tony started thinking that was seriously debatable.

Because his lil' girl was  ripe .

The tub's too big, she said. It's scary.

And, of course, because he is Tony Stark, every bathtub in the tower had to be enormous with every bell and whistle a bath-lover could want and Darcy is emphatically not a bath-lover, but if he didn't get her into something soapy soon, she was in danger of becoming Pig Pen, so he swallowed his pride and knocked on Rogers' door.

Rogers, in the way of the greatest generation, offered lots of suggestions, but no useful solutions. Romanoff suggested Tony get in the tub with her because it probably worked in Mother Russia or something and-- Jesus Christ, really?  Tony wasn't going there. He had his own water phobias to deal with. He sure as shit wasn't inflicting them on his newfound little sister.

Then, some sort of shared mind-meld thought occurred to Rogers and mini Barnes at the same time. They huddled up and asked Jarvis to ping Pepper and ask her to bring Darcy to the Rogers/Barnes floor. It was a Saturday afternoon, five days since the lab accident that changed Darcy and Barnes, and Darcy ... she looked like hell. Her sleep quality improved since the arrival of the cape, the gift of the teddy bear, and a few afternoons of hard play in the Hulk-out room with her two new pals, but her skin looked dry and patchy. Her hair was greasy, no thanks to Tony's robot car wash. And she was still a little high-strung yet, since her sleep hadn't settled to one or two long, uninterrupted periods of rest. Soon, Dr. Lin assured him.

In the meantime, though, she really needed a good scrubbing.

Romanoff ran a bath in Barnes' en suite and Rogers pulled Pepper aside to talk about ... whatever. Tony had no idea. Figuring out this bathtub thing was taking up all his bandwidth right now. Standing at the balcony doors, looking at the Hot Wheels spread across the terrace by a busy little boy, a pair of splashes and delighted squeals were the last thing he expected to hear.

And she laughed.


 Darcy laughed. 


What the hell.

Natasha stood in the bathroom doorway, smiling, arms crossed, as Darcy and Bucky made an unholy, soapy mess of everything the light touched. Steve and Pepper were drenched, but the room was filled with the light scent of apples and Darcy actually sat in the water looking relaxed. Upon closer inspection, Tony discovered a pair of waterproof bathroom stools in the water under each tiny butt.

""She can't swim,"" Natasha murmured under her breath. When Tony looked at her with the question in his eyes she explained, ""Barton told me once when I pulled bodyguard duty in London after the Convergence. Darcy never learned how to swim. Her parents--I don't know everything, but I know they weren't the kind of people who'd sign their kid up for swimming lessons. The tubs must seem huge to someone that small, sitting in it alone. Steve swears Bucky was born half-fish, but even the kid all but pulls Steve half-into the tub with him at bath time. Bucky's not afraid of baths because it's also playtime with his best friend, so Darcy might need the same thing, right?""

Tony didn't know what to say, so he tried out something new, ""Thanks.""

""You and Rogers are peas in a self-flagellating pod. You're too hard on yourself. You're doing okay. Who cares if she got a little crusty for a few days? She's five and she's probably never been showered with this much love and affection in her life. You're doing okay,"" she repeated.

And he was, he and  Pepper were figuring it out, but that didn't prevent Tony and Jarvis from hiring a discreet swimming instructor (who signed about a dozen NDAs) and inviting the Rogers-Barnes-Romanoff household down to the old Stark Mansion at Fifth Avenue to take advantage of the indoor pool and swimming lessons.

Rogers and Romanoff only made it half-way down the south hall before mini Barnes stripped off his shirt, kicked off his shoes, dropped his towel, and barreled into the natatorium at full speed, poised to cannonball.

Christ, that kid was built like a Mack truck. He hit the water with the kind of force Tony would expect the full-sized version to crash into the pool and came up shrieking, ""DARTHY! YOU GOT A POOL IN YA HOUTHE!""

"" 'A pool in your house',"" Pepper helpfully translated for Tony.

Steve's eyebrows nearly shot up off his head when he walked into the airy room. The glass ceiling and chandeliers hanging overhead were a bit much.

Tony rolled his eyes. ""My old man heard JFK had an indoor pool in the sixties, so he decided he needed to one-up the White House. You don't have to tell me it's over the top. I've seen five-star hotels with pools this one puts to shame. He built a bowling alley in the basement, too, because they have one at Camp David.""

Darcy sat on the edge of the pool in the tiniest one-piece bathing suit in the history of ever and it still sagged loose on her petite frame. Dark blue fabric with sparkling stars in the shape of constellations; she picked it out herself online with Jarvis playing personal shopper. And because she was Darcy in all things, she also had goggles, flippers, a snorkel, and a lightweight life vest on over the new suit. She would have put on the inner tube, too, but left that 'til last and couldn't figure out how to get it on over the vest.

""Pictures, J,"" Tony reminded his A.I. for the hundredth time that week.

After a quick explanation about why most of the swimming gear would have to stay on the deck because it was for more advanced swimming techniques, the swim instructor coaxed Darcy into the water in her life vest beside an enthusiastic Bucky. In the shallow end, they practiced putting their faces in the water and blowing bubbles, learned how to float on their backs, then tread water to stay upright, and held onto the side to kick like hell. It looked like so much fun, the adults eventually joined in, churning the pool into a roiling mess of waves that swamped Darcy once until she remembered how to float and bobbed upright all on her own.

So it was, later that night, Tony pulled on a fresh pair of swim trunks, climbed into a bathtub full of lavender bubbles, and accepted the hand-off of one exhausted, chlorine-scented five year old from Pepper who scrubbed her down over the side of the tub while Tony flipped her over against his shoulder like a limp noodle.

She slept fourteen hours straight and had to be carried to breakfast the next morning.

Today's prompt was provided by SweetSigyn. It probably wasn't even meant as a prompt, more just an off-hand mention, so if you'd like to see what you can inspire me to write, talk to me in the comments! Talk lots! Ramble! You never know what might inspire more of this!

One-word prompt: piggy

""Tony?"" Rogers hurried into the observation lounge outside the Hulk-out room. ""What's going on? Jarvis pulled me out of a meeting--thanks for that, by the way. That meeting was awful,"" he said as he came abreast of the engineer and peered into the oversized play space on the other side.

Darcy and Bucky sat on the floor with Hulk, one by each of his feet. (Darcy perched in a nest made entirely of Thor's cape.) They took turns grabbing a toe and laughing. For the life of him, Steve couldn't figure out what game they were playing.

Tony snickered and insisted, ""Just listen,"" as he reached over and toggled the sound inside the Hulk's playroom. The speaker suddenly crackled to life.

""No, no, no, silly,"" Darcy insisted. ""It goes like dis: Dis little piggy,"" she grabbed Hulk's big toe and he giggled, ""went to market.""

Bucky did the next on his side, ""Thith wittle piggy thtayed home.""

Hulk's chest shook with suppressed laughter as he tried not to shake the children loose. ""HULK TICKLES!"" Big Green warned his small friends.

""Dis little piggy had rose beast,"" Darcy proclaimed, wiggling her little fingers around Hulk's delicate middle toe.

Bucky picked it up, ""Thith wittle piggy had gum.""

""But that's not how it--""

""Sh!"" Tony hushed Rogers.

""LIL' PIG!"" Hulk lurched forward and grabbed his pinky toes, pulling his feet up off the floor in his eagerness to complete his first nursery rhyme. ""WEE WEE WEE, HOME!""

 ""Hohmygod,  that's adorable. Tell me we have it on video, Jarvis?"" Rogers begged.

Tony pretended to knuckle away a tear. ""This is the best thing science has ever done for me.""

 

  

The team developed a routine quickly after the children came into their lives, everyone coming together to provide a home as close to normal for the children as possible. Family meals became the norm with everyone clearing their schedule for family breakfast and an hour together at lunch, so getting together for Taco Tuesday at Darcy's request in the common room was practically routine by the second week.

Not routine?

No kids.

""Umm..."" Tony looked in all their favorite spots and hidey holes. ""Has anyone seen the kids? They were playing tag with the bots this morning, last I saw.""

The room paused. Everyone looked up from the devices they were switching to 'do not disturb' or the plates they were filling with tacos, the whites of their eyes showing as all the adults came to the same conclusion at once.

""Jarvis?"" Tony demanded. ""Where the hell are the kids?""

An image appeared projected on the kitchen back splash. Darcy and Bucky sat at Pepper's vanity in the penthouse master suite. Bucky dabbed dark green cream eyeshadow on Darcy's eyes up to her eyebrows and fumbled to outline her lips in lip gloss. Not to be outdone, Darcy appeared to be drawing a mustache and goatee on Bucky and laughing uproariously every time he made a Tony face.

""Perfooms!"" Darcy cried, sliding off the padded bench and hurrying to Pepper's collection of fancy French perfumes in their display case. It took her a few tries to wrap Thor's cape around her middle so she wouldn't trip. Grabbing the prettiest perfume bottle off the shelf, she sprayed herself directly in the face. After a few tense, eye-watering moments, she coughed, decided that one wasn't for her, and grabbed another. She worked through six more before asking Bucky what he thought.

He wrinkled his nose but clearly had no sense of self-preservation because he added, ""Wow. You thmell like lotth of great thingth, Darthy. You thould wear all of dem.""

She was certainly doing her best.

Next, they crawled deeper into the closet, coming up with a dozen of Pepper's shoes to try on.

They clomped around for a few moments, laughing at how hard the fancy shoes were to walk in.

Then Bucky found the mother lode. ""What'th thith?"" He held up a pair of odd-looking dark shoes with squared toes and thick, stacked heels.

""Oh, those are my da--"" She stopped and composed herself. ""Those are Tony's fancy boots for when he wants to feel big, like Captain Steve.""

Bucky shrugged and stepped into the boots. His eyes lit up when he stood up to his new, full height. ""Wow. I do feew big. Now I jutht need--""

A pair of traitorous bots wheeled into frame, holding up one of Tony's concert tees and a fire extinguisher.

""No, no, silly robots. Bucky needs a suit to be Tony!""

Bucky's little eyebrows pushed together. ""I never thaw Tony in a thuit. Jutht pajamath.""

""He wears suits,"" Darcy assured him.

""Why?""

""Because Miss Pepper makes him.""

Tony's eyes met Pepper's over the Taco Tuesday spread. Her face was bright red and she wasn't even pretending not to laugh.

 

 

Pepper took the kids' opinions into account when buying replacements of the many things they destroyed on a daily basis. How two children went through so many T-shirts and underwear, they'd never know. Tony peered over her shoulder, making suggestions on her StarkPad, too, but they all had very definite opinions.

Bucky bounced from one square to the next on the hopscotch grid they laid out on the playroom floor with duct tape. ""I want Black Widow underth!""

Black Widow boy shorts would have to do, but Tony would put a word in the ear of the manufacturer about making more of the Widow merch available in unisex styles.

Taking her turn at hopscotch, Darcy called out her request, ""Me, too! I want Thor panties!""

""HULK, THREE. PUNY GOD. ON BUTT."" Big Green insisted, turning from their game of hopscotch to look at Pepper and point at the seat of his stretchy Hulk pants.

 

 

Three days later, Tony and Steve sat in a brainstorming session with Clint, Sam, and Rhodey, reviewing last minute designs for tactical suits before they went into production. Romanoff and Banner had already signed off on theirs, so they were on kid duty for an hour so Tony's back could get a break from the sling and its wiggling occupant.

But Romanoff's voice suddenly filled the air. ""Could Tony and Steve please be excused to come down to the Hulk room? Pepper and I are going to need a hand. Actually..."" she paused, ""maybe this is an all hands on deck kind of situation.""

""Is it a Code Green?""

""Nothing like that,"" she insisted. ""Don't get your star-spangled knickers in a twist, Rogers. Just come downstairs. Maybe stop by the garage and pick up some sponges and buckets ... and soap, lots and lots of soap.""

Well, okay then...

Hurrying to do as their lady loves bid, Tony and Steve led the way, stopping for the requested supplies and hustling downstairs to the Hulk-out room.

The Hulk-out room that was covered as high as the Hulk could jump with fingerpaint. Gallons of fingerpaint in every color of the rainbow. Every wall, every window, every surface.

""Before you freak out, you should know that Jarvis supplied the paint and these three,"" Pepper pointed at the bots, also covered in paint splashes, ""did his dirty work.""

The bots perked up when the kids rounded the half-wall separating the observation room's entryway from the Hulk-out room and Tony laughed so hard, he cried.

Darcy and Bucky were stripped down to their fancy new Thor and Widow underoos, every inch of them covered in paint. Even their eyelashes were coated in paint. The three bots lined up to trail after the kids like Rorshach-on-acid ducklings. All of which would be no big deal, except that big kid number three came lumbering along behind the first two and the bots, wearing a pair of Hulk-out pants with an iron-on Loki face splashed across the ass and every color of fingerpaint known to man smeared from his messy hair to his toes.

It was in his  ears. 

Rainbow, Hulk-sized footprints were  everywhere. 

Tony grinned. ""I can't wait to show Bruce.""

This chapter immediately follows the bonus scene, ""It's A Girl"", I posted separately last night as part of this series with appropriate warnings. I recommend reading it before this update, but you can skip it if the warnings are a problem and not miss any important details that I haven't covered in this chapter.

Watch out below for hand-wavy medical terminology and diagnoses. I wanted the kids to contract an illness that took less than two weeks to incubate because I'm working within a timeline here, so I made one up, but I should have done my research because regular old strep only takes 2 - 5 days to incubate. Enter streptococcus tachenarxis (rapid onset strep throat) because I am a dumbass. :-P

Today's prompt was provided by SionnachOiche3.

 

One-word prompt: cold

Patience was not Tony Stark's strong suit.

He bounced lightly on the balls of his feet, waiting for hours, it seemed, for the return of the inbound quinjet from SI's upstate storage facility. The upstate property consisted of a dozen hangars around an aging airport and runway, a short half-mile from Howard's old Adirondack camp and horse farm, built as a family retreat on an island in the middle of a lake (not at all surprisingly re-named after Howard in the late forties) around the turn of the century by one of the big, new money, steel barons. From the fifties to the late eighties, it was used for SI's up and coming movers and shakers. A young Tony would have loved the camp, if he and his parents ever stayed there for anything other than business conferences.

Darcy would love it, he considered. Might be worth fixing up to get the whole team-turned-family away from the city next summer for some sun and fun on the lake and a real vacation. Darcy could have a pony at the farm and ride every day all summer, if she liked. Bucky could wear himself out at the swimmin' hole and paddling around the lake in one of the museum-quality preserved canoes. Or... He reconsidered. With a little TLC, able bodies, and elbow grease, the superintendent of the farm could ready the main lodge for an old fashioned family Christmas celebration. Like those Rockwell paintings. People did that right? Families? With a real tree and stockings hung by a thing with care and a big, brown bird of some sort, baked and ... er, slathered with the gravy. He'd have to ask Jarvis, but that sounded right.

A signed order of adoption was on its way to the clerk of courts, making the family part true enough, and he was determined not to fuck it up right out of the gate. Christmas was just two weeks away. He could give her one really great Christmas memory to hold onto from her second childhood, if he got it right.

If she remembered her second childhood when the regression spell wore off, that is.

And if she didn't, they'd have countless terabytes of photos, video, and audio recordings to share the experience later. Tony resolved on the spot to install more cameras everywhere. Darcy should have a cell phone and a tracker, too, maybe embedded in something pretty, like a necklace or one of those monogram bracelets with the little letters for ""Darcy Morgan Stark"". And were her ears pierced? Now he couldn't remember. She might want to do that with Pepper, if they weren't pierced already. During Darcy's nap, he and Jarvis could look up ear piercing aftercare online.

(The experts advised against naps for most five year olds, but Darcy's disrupted sleep habits made her the exception to the rule. She was still catching up and keeping up with Bucky and Hulk was no easy feat. Tony heard through the busybody A.I. grapevine that Rogers and Romanoff started a phonics program with Bucky, something to keep him busy during Darcy's afternoon downtime. Jarvis especially enjoyed the challenge of creating customized reading and math programs to catch Bucky up to current public school standards, in case their age regression was more permanent than Frigga warned.)

A pinpoint appeared in the distance, slowly making its way toward the tower. Tony sighed in relief. He didn't like the idea of them being out there, vulnerable, even with Rhodey, the War Machine suit, and a terrifying Black Widow on board. Anything less than four Avengers was not enough, as far as he was concerned. He made a note to finish the designs for Pepper's emergency suit and get Jarvis started on the early fab today. No time like the present to outfit his lady love in titanium armor than to protect their little ironlette.

But there were some things even Tony couldn't protect his little girl from, which became immediately obvious as Pepper and Romanoff disembarked, each with a limp child in their arms. Mini Barnes was a  beast  of a six year old, too. Tony rushed across the hangar to take the kid from Romanoff.

""What's this about?"" he asked, shifting Bucky to get a better grip under his thighs and haul him up to hitch the kid's legs over his own hips.

""We were just wrapping up the tour, heading to the lodge for lunch, when Darcy and Bucky both started complaining about how warm it was."" Pepper clucked her tongue and brushed the hair off of Darcy's damp forehead. ""It can't be forty degrees up north, outside, Tony. There's no way they were just overheated in light winter coats.""

But Darcy's emerald green pea coat was unbuttoned and her face was flushed. Bucky's fleece-lined parka was unzipped, sleeves pushed up, hood thrown back. His hair was soaked, skin sheened with sweat. The poor kid was roasting in his own juices.

Tony stopped, demanding, ""Help me get this off of him. Something's wrong. He's burning up. Darcy, too. Get the coats off.""

Romanoff unbundled the coat and reached around his neck to unbutton the rugby shirt for good measure. Rhodey did the same, slipping Darcy's arms out of her sleeves and pulling back the collar of her T-shirt to check her temp. The look on his face was not good.

""Jarvis,"" the Russian called out, ""please page Dr. Lin and Steve. Tell them to come to the common room. Tell the doctor to bring his bag. Then, contact medical, let them know they're at Dr. Lin's beck and call until informed otherwise, and get a pair of nurses upstairs to help Dr. Lin as needed."" She worried her lip. ""This happened fast. Ten minutes ago, they were flushed, but chatty, talking about playing hide and seek with the bots before dinner.""

Fifteen minutes and a flurry of activity later, Dr. Lin advised moving the children to one of the guest suits off of the common room, to make it easier for the nurses to come and go as needed.

""I know it's sudden and seems quite frightening,"" he assured the four inexperienced guardians, ""but it looks like good old streptococcus. Nothing to worry over, especially, but we'll keep a close eye on James to be sure, since he's hasn't had a chance to develop modern antibodies like Darcy. Fortunately for him, his playmate is also sick. If we keep them close, some of her natural antibodies will be shared.""*

""Do you think it would help if one of us with the serum stayed close, too?"" Steve asked, pointing to himself, Natasha, and Pepper.

Dr. Lin smiled a knowing grin. ""While I don't doubt the medical marvel that is Dr. Erskine's formula and its many varieties, I think you'll have to fight Anthony for who's watching over the children."" Then he laughed as Tony's bots pushed back the pocket doors leading to the guest room next door where a pair of engineering interns were busy setting up an interim workshop for Tony and portable charging stations for the bots.

""Tony, that's hardly conducive to--""

""Finding the cure for strep and the common cold?"" He waved Pepper off. ""I'll make it work. Don't mind me, Doc Lin. Go about your business,"" he wagged a dismissive hand as he leaned over to lift and transfer Darcy to a custom-made adjustable king size bed. Without waiting for the others, he switched Bucky over, too, settling him right next to Darcy in the middle of the bed. With a testy pair of grumbles, they shifted to face each other. Bucky flipped his pillow over to find the cold side and Darcy started struggling to pull her undershirt off. Willing to do whatever it took to make her comfortable, Tony stripped Darcy down to her Mjolnir-emblazoned Thorties and flicked open the lightest, thinnest sheet available from the stack of linens brought down by housekeeping. That seemed like a fine idea to Bucky; he grunted and huffed until Steve sat on the edge of the bed to lend him a hand removing his undershirt, too. Down to just his Hawkeye boxers, Bucky's fever became even more apparent. Covered with sweat, his skin looked mottled and red everywhere.

""We'll do what we can to bring down his fever without disturbing the body's natural process of fighting off illness,"" Dr. Lin warned. ""I know it's tempting to give them antibiotics or Tylenol or some such, but the fever is beneficial to a point and antibiotics should be reserved for an infection the body won't easily overcome on its own. We'll work with the fever."" He eyeballed Tony. ""And keep our heads.""

""Dr. Lin,"" Jarvis' volume matched the quiet of the sickroom, ""Medical reports a positive match for the early strep test. The lab suggests it's likely a mutant strain of streptococcus tachenarxis and the worst of the symptoms should clear up in a few days, though the children might be contagious for up to another week.""

""There, see?"" The doctor pointed to the ceiling, indicating Jarvis' good news. ""Just the good word we were hoping for.""

At that precise moment, something flickered across Darcy's face. Something painfully familiar to Tony. He snatched up a basin and lunged across the bed just in time to catch a veritable waterfall of puke. Rogers, thankfully quick on the uptake, assumed the sight-slash-smell-slash-movement of the bed would lead to worse yet and scrambled to the other side of the bed in the nick of time to catch Bucky's response in the bedside trashcan.

""Ha!"" Dr. Lin laughed, clapping his hands in delight. ""You'll be fine! Excellent. I'll be back this afternoon to check in on our patients. Jarvis will keep me posted if anything comes up in the meantime."" He jiggled his Starkphone at the security camera beside the door and swept out of the room like a man on a mission.

A man on a mission to never rinse out a sick bucket again.

""That was ... impressive."" Romanoff stood at the end of the bed, arms folded over her chest.

Tony shrugged. ""I've seen plenty of people about to puke; I knew it was coming before Darcy knew she needed to,"" he said, exchanging basins with the nurse who helpfully offered a fresh one and a wet cloth to wipe down Darcy's face. Laying the basin by her side, he brushed the hair from her eyes and cleaned her face and chin. Another exchange with a nurse--more wet cloths--and he started in on the layer of sweat clinging to her neck and chest. Carefully, propping her chest against his wide palm, he bent her over his forearm as little as possible to run the cool cloth over her back.

When he was done, her eyes popped open and she whined, ""Miss Pepper said you hab a surprise for me. Can I hab it noooow?""

Grabbing another cool cloth, Tony settled on the bed and pulled Darcy into his lap. ""It's not the kind of surprise you unwrap.""

He looked around the room, not unsure, but a little uncomfortable announcing his news to their friends and family all at once. Bruce, Clint, Sam, and Rhodey were gathered in the common room, in the seating area closest to the guest room housing the kids. Rogers and Romanoff sat in a pair of chairs on Bucky's side of the big adjustable bed.

Pepper knew he had the paperwork, of course--not that he'd already signed it.

""But it's a good surprise, I think."" He set the cloth aside and relaxed into the raised mattress at his back, smiling faintly when Darcy stretched out the full length of his forearm to cool off. ""Before the lab accident that made you and Bucky little again, you asked him to have lunch with you because you were nervous I'd change my mind and cancel the meeting I had scheduled with the lawyers after lunch that day.""

""What's a lawler do?"" Darcy grumbled.

""My lawyers were supposed to meet me to finalize an order of adoption grownup you and I filed a few months before that, for me and you to become a family. Jarvis hasn't said anything, but I think you and Jane were talking about it that day in the lab, and the lawyers had to wait because you were suddenly little and you needed me to act like a dad right away.""

""I 'member. You said we be famiwy. I want'd to,"" she murmured. It was an odd quirk of the regression that both kids seemed to remember the events surrounding the lab accident with startling bursts of occasional clarity. ""Da lady doctor said mean fings, sell out  --real mean--  mid-wife cwisis. "" Her brow puckered and an angry tear spilled over her cheek.

The words may have been garbled, but Tony got the gist of Foster's insults and Darcy's lingering disillusionment and anger for her friend, but he'd deal with whatever demonic space viking crap Foster had pulling her strings later.

""Dr. Foster is very single-minded and driven."" Pepper tried to reassure Darcy. ""I think it hurt her feelings when you told her you were coming to work for me and Tony, sweetie, but you didn't hurt her on purpose.""

""Didn't mean to..."" Darcy whined, curling in on herself to rub her forehead against Tony's bicep.

""We know, kiddo."" He squeezed her gently. ""The surprise is that I signed the papers today and made it official so I can be your dad for real, and not just because you're little. The lawyers are filing the paperwork right now. Jarvis?"" he asked. A digital copy of the document appeared on the TV on the wall opposite the headboard, proclaiming Darcy Morgan Stark the legal daughter of Anthony Edward Stark. (The signatures of Clint Barton, under Darcy's name, and Steve Rogers, under Tony's name, were signed with a great deal more enthusiasm than the average legal witness and were sure to make Darcy laugh when she was grown again.)

""See that?"" he asked. Darcy tried to raise her head, but exhaustion won out. She grunted and shook her head, so Tony lifted her high enough to show her the order of adoption. ""That says you're Darcy Stark now. No take-backs, squirt. It's you, me, and your brother bots against the world.""

She smiled, said, "" 'kay,"" twisted her hands into Tony's ragged T-shirt, and passed out cold.

Dipping his head in thanks at the round of whispered, ""Congratulations, man,"" from his friends, he shifted to lay Darcy back down on the bed beside her feverish best friend. Poor Bucky was soaked, despite the recent sponge bath Steve and Natasha gave him while Tony spoke to Darcy. It was going to be a long few days.

Really, the first twenty-four hours weren't so bad. Darcy and Bucky were so out of it, they couldn't do much more than drink cool water through a straw and sleep, piled up together in the middle of the bed like puppies.

The next forty-eight hours were a completely different story...

Thanks to MichelleLynne for the bit about cats. She knows what she did. *winks*

One-word prompt: unicorn

""How's it feel?""

""Hmm...?""

""Being a father,"" Steve elaborated as they watched over their charges from opposite sides of the bed.

""Uh, same as yesterday."" Tony scratched his stubble. ""But with more terrifying responsibility and a sudden, intense, blazing distrust of all teenage boys.""

Pepper snorted and made an effort to disappear into the work on the StarkPad in her lap.

Tony's hair stuck up every which way and he looked like something scraped off the bathroom floor of a dive bar. Worrying always reduced him to the pre-Iron Man guy who frequently forgot to brush his teeth and what day it was, but he was managing this newest crisis well, under the circumstances.

Darcy spoke very little during the first day and a half of their illness. She answered questions when directly spoken to, but otherwise didn't cry out from discomfort or seek comfort from any of the adults. She received comfort nonetheless. Tony rarely sat more than an arm's reach away. He pulled a chair up next to the bed to fidget with some small gadget for Darcy while the bots brought him everything he needed from the temporary workshop next door. (Dum-E made a special trip up to Darcy's room to retrieve her Bucky Bear and Thor's cape, which was accidentally sent upstairs with her coat when they disembarked earlier.) When she wasn't draped over, wrapped around, or buried under a delirious, sweating Bucky, Tony held her, offering cooling sips of water from a cup with a straw and running a hand over her hair or down her back, just offering whatever comfort she might accept.

Bucky cried for his ma.

At first, Steve almost missed the strange, lisping litany. Growing up, determined immigrant parents encouraged Bucky to speak in English as much as possible. In fact, Steve didn't know Bucky even spoke Romanian until they were twelve. Buck's ma was first generation Romanian-American. Buck's pop was Irish-Romanian-American, second generation, and very proud of being born an American. Though they spoke Romanian at home, they rarely did so in front of non-Romanian friends.

Meaning Steve.

So he didn't recognize the plea for what it was until Nat nudged him with her boot and gave him the 'do something' look.

""What?"" he hissed.

She made a big, exasperated face at him. ""He's crying for his mother, Steven. You could hug him.""

Steve shifted forward in his chair, gripping the armrests. ""Is that... Is that really what he's saying?""

""You didn't know?""

""I speak a lot of languages, Nat, but Bucky rarely ever spoke Romanian when we were kids, and never to me. Lisping Romanian isn't exactly in my repertoire."" He grabbed one of the ever-present cloths and dabbed Bucky's flushed face. ""I can't give him his ma. I can't make it better. I can't even understand what's he asking for when he does get a few words out. I haven't felt this useless since before I met Erskine.""

""May I?"" she asked, pointing to the space between Steve and Bucky.

""Please,"" he begged.

With years of training that made it second nature, she deliberately softened her features like slipping on a mask of loving motherhood and eased into the space by Bucky's side of the bed. In a surprisingly tender alto voice, she crooned--a song that could have been a Romanian lullaby, but she'd never tell and Steve would never ask. Drawn to the familiar sound, Bucky blinked in confusion, but slid off the bed and into her lap, and there he stayed for another hour, murmuring nonsensically against the Black Widow's breasts.

Surreal though it was, it looked kind of right, like Nat knew what she was doing and Bucky was feeling it, and Steve's stomach did a weird thing that made him envious of Tony all of a sudden. Tony who had no family, so he adopted a like-minded young woman who needed one, too. Why shouldn't it be that easy?

Eventually, Dr. Lin returned and requested his patients be returned to bed for their checkup. Nat struggled a little under the weight of lifting a solid six year old Bucky, but she managed, and before Steve could open his mouth to offer help.

He had to give Tony all the credit in the world, not once did he give either Steve or Nat shit about how they responded to caring for Bucky. Fatherhood was already working wonders on Tony.

Reassured by the elderly doctor's presence and confidence, Steve asked if there was anything he should be doing. He felt worse than useless; he knew Bucky didn't want him anyway. He wanted the one person Steve couldn't bring him.

""You're doing just fine,"" the doctor repeated. ""And no--you can't give him his mother. I'm sorry for that. I know it must be very difficult, but you can show him he's loved by you and these others here."" And, of course, Steve knew the doctor spoke the truth. Sam and Clint hadn't moved except to fetch fresh pitchers of water and snacks from the kitchen in hours. Rhodey sat in a few meetings for Pepper, who set up a kind of SI triage area out in the common room for her assistants with U as the go-between. (Bruce, he assumed, was sleeping like the dead after a week of hard play as the Hulk.)

And Nat... She stayed by his side, as much for Bucky as to keep Steve from crawling out of his own skin from the need to  do something. 

""Clint,"" she called to her partner. ""Sit with Bucky for a few minutes? Steve needs some air.""

Okay, then. Air, it is.

When the cool winter air of New York hit him in the face, he took a deep, cleansing breath and chanced a glance at the pretty redhead out of the corner of his eye. ""Thanks. You're right. I needed to take a break.""

""Maybe you should give yourself a break, too. Do you know how many times I've sat by actual human disaster Clint Barton's hospital bed, feeling like the worst, incompetent, hopeless excuse for a friend? He's held together with bubble gum and wire hangers at this point and it never gets easier. I can't imagine how hard it must be watching your partner--your suddenly  six year old  partner--in the same position, but begging for a mother who died half a century ago."" She crowded him, daring him to push her away even as she wrapped her arms around his waist. ""You do what you can with what you have, Steve. It's all anybody can ask of you.""

""Thanks."" The word caught in Steve's throat at the memory of Natasha singing to and rocking his tiny best friend. ""Thanks--for all of this. I never even asked. I'm selfish, but I just... I was so  relieved  when you stuck around to help. I never thought about how hard this would be for you.""

""This isn't difficult for me,"" she soothed. ""I owe him a debt. You forget--Yasha was there when I was a small child, too. He taught me things that  kept me alive.  A song his mother might have sang for him is nothing compared to what he gave me.""

""He loved you, you know.""

""What he was enjoyed me. I was an immaculate kind of protege, a point of pride to a person who had nothing else, not even the knowledge that he was his own person. He was Yasha--Soldat, first and foremost."" She pressed her head into the tender underside of Steve's jaw. ""This ... with James. It's more personal, more important, like giving something back to both of us that we lost, like learning how to be people and family again. It's precious to me.""

""Well, I'm grateful, whatever your reasons. Thank you."" But when their eyes met and hers shimmered with unshed tears, he had to say it again, once more with kisses. ""Thank you,"" he murmured, tasting her soft lips, gently suckling the bottom lobe and siphoning off what sadness remained. Then another and another, until they were out of breath, her face rubbed red from his beard. When the tears dried and composure returned, she nuzzled him like a friendly feline, seeking more. He'd give her all of it and then some, if she let him. Someday, he hoped she'd let him give her everything.

When the fever finally broke a few hours later, Bucky lay limp and soggy, and definitely not in a mood to talk with his sore throat, so Jarvis queued up a movie while Darcy and Bucky drifted back to their little nest in the middle of the pillows and cape at the top of the bed. Some of the others joined them. Bringing low chairs and cushions from the common room to pile up on the floor together for the day.

They started with the original Batman movies. Bucky, it turned, out, loved Catwoman, rasping as the end credits rolled, ""Ith thee a goo' guy? Ith thee a ba' guy? Don' know. Betht part. Thee'th mythteriouth.""

Steve didn't miss the pointed look Clint threw at Natasha, but he ignored it just the same.

""So you like cats, huh,"" Sam asked Bucky.

Bucky stared at him, eyebrow cocked as he tried to understand some deeper meaning behind the question, then shrugged. ""They're okay.""

Steve stared at Sam, like, ""Really, Sam?""

""What? I always thought he'd be a cat person. Confirmation!"" He raised both fists in victory.

""I like puppies,"" Darcy piped up from her spot smooshed against Bucky's side with the Bucky Bear between them and Thor's cape wrapped around them like a burrito. ""And robots,"" she assured a dejected Dum-E. ""And bunnies and horses and cows and camels and fishies and unicorms, but mostly puppies. Do you have any puppy movies, Jarvis?""

""Would you prefer the Beethoven series, Air Buddies series, or a selection of Disney classics, Miss Stark?""

She started in surprise at the 'Miss Stark' until Tony leaned over to whisper in her ear.

""I didn't 'member that part. Stark,"" she rolled the name around in her mouth like she was tasting and feeling it with all of her teeth.

""He can call you Darcy, instead, if you want,"" Tony offered, but Steve saw the poorly masked cringe.

""No, no, I wanna be Stark so we belong toge'ver. I 'member dat,"" she promised Tony before kissing him on the cheek and wrapping her little arms around his neck in a tight hug. Pepper looked like she might burst from happiness.

""So."" Tony plucked Darcy out of their nest and climbed onto the bed beside Bucky. ""While Jarvis queues up Beethoven, tell me more about puppies and horses. I was just thinking earlier--we've got a farm upstate, be a great place for the next Stark to ride a pony, if she got one for Christmas.""

""Tony! You can't just buy a pony!"" Pepper gasped, more out of habit than anything else, Steve suspected.

He waved her off. ""We'll adopt the pony. I'm sure there's a shelter somewhere in the state for horses and circus animals. In fact."" He pursed his lips. ""The Darcy Stark Foundation has a nice ring to it. Fundraising for animal shelters would be a good platform for the newest Stark to get involved in charity work. Learn how to Stark from the ground up, so to speak, but only if you want to,"" he vowed.

""Will there be puppies?"" This was the sticking point, apparently.

""Yes. Dum-E, write that down,"" Tony ordered. ""Lots of puppies. And cats for mini Barnes.""

""And bunnieth,"" Bucky muttered out of the side of his mouth.

""And bunnies."" Tony nodded in agreement without batting an eye.

The robot spun in a slow circle, as if looking for a pencil. It whirred in excitement, then bolted out of the room.

""Dum-E!"" Pepper's assistant bellowed as the unmistakable sound of reams of paper fluttering to the floor could be heard.

""You better start building a robot to clean up after the other robots,"" Pepper muttered.

""Jarvis,"" Darcy called out to the A.I. ""Write dat down.""

One-word prompt: siren

""Did you know ...NATHA maketh thpathethuitth ta protect athtronautth fwom nuffin'?""  Bucky asked of no one in particular as he paged through a Space Camp brochure helpfully provided by Jarvis to stave off boredom during day three of their quasi-quarantine due to strep throat. His reading program was coming along quickly thanks to Jarvis, though the A.I. and Darcy still had to help him with words longer than four letters. The kids had been lying in bed on their bellies, heads tilted, sucking on popsicle after popsicle, reading through the thick stack of space magazines and information for hours.

Out loud.

""I... What?"" Steve asked, shifting to stare at Bucky's lips and willing him to repeat it so he'd have another crack at figuring out what he just said.

""NASA makes spacesuits to protect astronauts from nothing. Neat, huh, Captain Steve?"" Darcy's faint whisper was only marginally easier to understand.

""It sure is."" He nodded, trying to drum up some new enthusiasm for space facts. Because science fiction nerd Bucky Barnes knew lots of science facts and he was sharing them whether you're interested or not, if you were stuck in this room. And Steve loves Bucky, he does, but the other adults abandoned the sickroom after the seventeenth or thirty-sixth, or whatever it was, space science fact to which they'd been treated, and apparently, that was everyone else's limit. Steve had long since reached his, but his stubborn determination to stick it out had bitten him in the ass and everyone else was tucked safely out of hearing range of space fact number whatever in the kitchen, probably drinking all the coffee and not saving Steve any waffles.

In his life since coming out of the ice, Steve had never wished so hard for an assemble call, so he suffered a moment of stuttering disbelief when the siren actually sounded.

""Shit,"" he swore, launching out of his chair to grab the nearest StarkPad where Jarvis brought up security footage of... ""Ugh. Doombots? Again?"" Steve groaned.

""Thteebie?"" Bucky worried.

Taking a deep breath and composing his features, Steve turned around with the most encouraging expression he could muster. ""Hey pal, I gotta go do my Captain job for a little bit, but it'll be okay because Pepper's going to stay right here and Rhodey and Sam will swap out as air support is needed, so one of them will always be nearby, too, okay? Remember we talked about how this might happen?""

""It's okay, Bucky,"" Darcy soothed her friend. ""Tony will be wif Captain Steve and Miss Nat. He'll watch deir backs above deir heads!""

""Thteebie, what about... What happenth if ya get hurt?"" Bucky's lip wobbled and Steve kind of wanted to cry himself. Had there ever been a time when Bucky Barnes hadn't been worried about his health and safety first?

""I heal real fast, pal. Real fast. I probably won't be gone more than a few hours. In fact, I bet Nat comes to--""

Right on cue, Nat and Tony burst into the room, followed by Pepper, concerned, but calm, cool, and collected as ever. Tony swept Darcy up in a hug and pressed kisses all over her face, promising to be home in a few hours, then they'd have some more popsicles and a Mythbusters marathon.

"" 'kay,"" she replied. Confident in Tony's tech and knowledge of robots, she kissed his cheek and told him to have fun and be safe and bring her home a robot, please.

How is this the same child who couldn't say 'boo' to Pepper twelve days ago without Tony's support?

Bucky, meanwhile, wore himself down to a nub with worry as he hung onto Natasha for dear life and begged, ""Thteebie hath aththma weal bad. Ya gotta keep an eye on 'im tho he doethn't overdo it fightin' bad guyth, okay? Becauthe it hurtth hith heart thometimeth, too.""

But Nat didn't remind him about the serum or that Steve had been cured of all his childhood ailments. Instead, she promised she would watch his back and bring him home as safe as she could. They both might be injured, but Tony had wonderful doctors on staff and the Avengers trained every day for emergencies like this one.

Then Pepper found the right combination of words to add when she reminded Bucky, ""Hulk is going along, too. He'll keep an eye on your parents.""

Bucky blinked at the mention of parents and swallowed hard, but nodded and eventually let go of Nat to accept a fierce hug from Steve. ""Promithe you'll be carefu', Thteebie.""

""I promise, pal."" He kissed him on the head and reluctantly let go.

""We'll be fine. Rhodey's taking the first shift, so Sam will stay here with us,"" Pepper called after him as he kicked off his boots and hurried to the locker room, taking the stairs three at a time.

But when Sam sat in, and Bucky had a new ear to bend, all he could think about was Steve and Steve's health because Rhodey cut into the comms with a resigned sigh and a message from Sam through Jarvis. ""Man, how sick were you before the serum, Rogers? This kid is  freaking out,  like you're coming back in a pine box, accompanied by a priest with a sad telegram. I now have a  list  of all of your known infirmities, as well as your food allergies,  and  a list of things that are too fibrous for you to swallow without choking. Dude, there are conditions on this list I've never heard of!""

""Remind them about hith aththma, though, Tham!"" a voice insisted in the background.

""Avengers,"" Sam raised his voice. ""Please be advised that you will face the wrath of one very angry six year old best friend if Captain Steve Rogers returns to the tower with so much as a hair out of place on his delicate, wheezy head."" He paused. ""Happy now?""

""Yeth."" A pause. ""Wait--""

Sam sighed.

""If hith back thtartth to hurt, remind him to way down on da floor and bend hith kneeth and to breave thlow until hith heart thtopth rathing. That'th i'portant.""

""Got all that?"" Sam asked as Rhodey swore ripely and dodged a Doombot with laser eyes.

""Thank you for humoring him, Sam. He means well."" Steve laughed to himself. ""I think he forgets sometimes that I'm not six, too.""

""It'll get better,"" Pepper assured Steve. ""Happy used to all but strip-search Tony when he came back to the shop in Malibu after a fight with armor falling off as he touched down on the landing pad. When he was thirty-five. Best friends worry; that's all."" But she said it with a smile in her voice and Steve  knew  she was laughing quietly at his expense.

It did get better.

They had a rush of assemble calls within three or four days--Steve honestly forgot how long it had been since the first assemble. Hell, since he'd slept in his own bed. Bucky and Darcy were on the mend, chomping at the bit to get out of bed and play when they weren't napping from all the energy it took to complain about being bored and sick.

Pepper was right, of course, in that the first return from an assemble was the most difficult. Jarvis played a carefully selected montage of footage from the fight intended to console a worried Bucky. It helped a lot, but that first time, Steve capitulated to the well-meant bullying and suffered Bucky giving him his own thorough checkup, including his temperature, heart rate, and peeking into his ears and staring into his pupils.

Somehow, Steve managed not to laugh.

Whatever Bucky saw there seemed to satisfy him because his only recommendation was lots of rest in the sickroom (where Bucky could keep an eye on him).

Natasha watched over the entire process with amusement, kissing him breathless later, during Bucky's nap when Steve moved to the chair by the bed so she could climb into his lap, fresh and powdered from her recent shower. And she brought vodka.

""You're the kind of father I can only imagine most children wish they had, even if Bucky looks at you and still sees his little buddy."" It was said with a smile and unmistakable love in her eyes. He loved her and said so often, but never felt it more so than when the contrast between the sweet, softer Natasha who sang to a little boy and the one with all the hard edges and brash confidence blurred to make this lovely in-between.

He loved the in-between best.

Two missions and three days after the first big, post-lab accident assemble call, they returned home, dirty and disheveled, to an empty sickroom. Darcy, Jarvis reported, was playing with a water-proof bot prototype in Tony's massive shower while Pepper worked on her StarkPad, watching over the little one from the room next door.

Bucky, on the other hand...

""It appears Master Barnes has discovered one of Agent Barton's many entries into the ventilation system. How do you wish to proceed, Captain Rogers?""

Steve turned flinty eyes on Barton who was currently in no condition to crawl into the vents after a child: barely conscious, drooling, and flirting with the nurses. Badly.

""Perhaps if you prepared one of Master Barnes' favorite meals in the apartment nearest his location, he would venture forward on his own?"" Jarvis suggested.

Because no way was Steve fitting in the vents. Barton barely fit through them, and only by sheer determination in some narrower spots.

""Do we have sensors near enough his location to locate him, Jarvis?""

""Currently, there is a heat signature similar to a slightly elevated human body temperature registering in the vicinity of Agent Romanoff's dining room.""

""He's crawling around above my apartment?"" she asked, surprised.

""He appears to have disabled all of the tripwires and is quite safe, I assure you.""

Tripwires. Steve blinked at Nat. She shrugged. ""Early warning, non-lethal. Mostly to deter Clint from snooping and playing pranks.""

Alrighty then...

Employing Jarvis' advice, they pulled together the makings of Bucky's favorite meal--grilled pepperoni and mozzarella sandwiches (thanks, Barton), sliced apples, and homemade caramel sauce. Steve popped open the kitchen ceiling vent and Natasha waved the steam from lunch towards the opening with a thin cutting board.

Thirty seconds later, Bucky came scrambling toward the smell like a rat to the tune of the piper.

""Hey pal, whatcha doin' up there?"" Steve asked when the top of Bucky's head and eyes appeared from the recesses of the ventilation system.

""Readin'...?"" But he phrased it like a question and if Steve had spidey senses, they would have tingled, especially when Buck disappeared and Steve heard the sound of something being folded and shoved in the back of his pants.

Sneaky little shit.

With a bit of help, he managed to climb down to Nat's kitchen island and grab a seat in the breakfast nook, pressing his back solidly against the chair.

Ah. The game is afoot, then...

Steve served up lunch and bided his time.

With his belly full and the carbo-load sitting in his belly like an anchor, Bucky just about dozed off at the table, leaning forward far enough for Steve to catch sight of the magazine sticking up out of Bucky's waistband.

""So, Buck... What were ya readin' up there that required such a quiet spot in the middle of Nat's booby traps?""

Like a deer in headlights, Bucky sat up, eyes wide, frozen with the last bite of pizza grilled-cheese half-chewed in his mouth.

""Hand it over."" Steve held out a hand and waited with that look on his face his ma always gave him. The look that meant you were either going to end up on your knees scrubbin' or prayin' away whatever put that guilty look in your eyes in the first place.

""I wike da theiling ventth. It'th pwivate,"" Bucky answered with a mutinous look and a huff, and crossed arms for good measure.

""You're six. Why do you need to be that private?""

With a resigned grumble, Bucky handed over his prize.

A skin mag with Barton's name printed in the address window.

""In my defenths, Thteebie, thith book ith full of naked ladieth! There'th a whole lib'ary of 'em in a clothet that nobody'th readin'!""

""Buck, this is pornography.""

""Yeah, the futthure thure ith thwell..."" he said with a dreamy look into the distance.

Steve snapped his fingers in front of Bucky's face to call his attention back to the matter at hand. ""Where'd you get this, Buck?""

""Mithter Hawkeye'th apar'ment.""

""How'd you get in?""

Bucky shrugged. ""Jimmied da lock.""

Steve took a deep breath. He didn't know where to begin. Pornography certainly wasn't meant for children in any century, but there was nothing inherently wrong with the human body. Times had changed and he needed to discipline Bucky appropriately, but on the other hand, they were both raised Catholic, and what would Father Brennan say if he were still alive?

""I know you knew what you were doing was wrong because you tried to hide."" He leaned over to look Bucky directly in the eye. ""Do you know the kind of penance Father Brennan would give you for this?""

But somehow, Bucky managed to turn the tables and leave Steve floundering again in the next breath. ""Hey, Thteebie? How'th come we don't gotta go ta thurthch no more?""

Steve swallowed the ball of guilt that welled up out of the ether--guilt he hadn't felt in years, his thoughts racing a million miles an hour as he tried to come up with an excuse for really and truly failing in his duties as the guardian of a child raised in the Catholic Church. Why don't they go to church anymore, indeed.

Nat's eyes met his over the table and he saw the warning there-- ""He's playing you; don't fall for it.""

But, shit, who dropped the ball here? Not Bucky. Little boys are curious and they get into all kinds of trouble. Sometimes, Catholic and mom guilt were the  only  things in their lives to keep them on the straight and narrow back in their day. They were still training up to be good men at Bucky's age.

After a handful of steadying breaths, he turned to his best friend and agreed, ""You're absolutely right, Buck. It's time to go confess.""

""What? No. That'th a terrible idea!"" Bucky back-pedaled in every way, pushing out his chair in a rush to clamor up onto the kitchen island toward the vent and escape.

""Nuh, uh, uh, pal. If you're well enough to crawl through the vents reading Barton's skin mags, you're well enough to go to confession. Let's go put on our church clothes.""

""Traitor,"" Bucky grumbled as Steve tossed him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. ""If you wath thtill wittle, you'da been in the ventth wif me and you know it.""

THIS CHAPTER IS THE MID-POINT OF THE 25-DAY ADVENT CHALLENGE, YOU GUYS. LOOK AT ME OVER HERE, GETTING SHIT DONE LIKE I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I AM SO EXCITE. (^_^)

Here; have some Natasha-as-mama-bear POV to celebrate with me! Fair warning: there's a bit more angst in this update, but I am giving you a totally fluffy ending because I love you all and you're so good to me with the comments and kudos and all the sweet shit you say to me. *slobbers you all with kisses*

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""How did it go?"" Natasha asked as Steve and a notably subdued Bucky returned to their apartment hours later. Bucky made a beeline for his room and closed the door with a quiet click. Staring down the hall, Natasha waited for the usual sounds of boy chatter: Bucky yammering at Jarvis about his day and what story he'd like for bedtime, talking to himself as he got ready for his bath, the sounds of pretend explosions as he crashed his Matchbox cars into each other, but there was nothing. No sound at all.

When she turned back to Steve, his face was an inscrutable mask. She didn't know this Steve without his heart in his eyes.

""Not good, then,"" she surmised, setting aside the busywork she'd brought along to wait for their return.

Steve snorted and she noted his shaking hands. Steve Rogers did  not  shake over a little boy's confession of barely existent naughtiness. ""Scratch that--really not good. Steve, what's going on?""

""Father Michael thinks I might not be the most suitable choice to raise Bucky, especially if he's stuck like this for much longer. I'm supposed to pray on it this week and think about what's best for Bucky's spiritual well-being. He was particularly annoyed that he couldn't give me proper penance because my confession wasn't as contrite as it should be about distancing myself from the church and its teachings.""

""I thought this confession thing was just a guilt-tactic to remind Bucky that Santa's watching. Why were you being lectured about his spiritual well-being?""

""Bucky's only six. The church requires that children wait until the age of reason for first communion and there's no point to a child confessing without the benefit of reason. Next year, maybe."" Steve leaned on the counter, the marble creaking under the pressure of his grip as he wrapped his fingers around the beveled edge.

""Okay,"" she prompted, prying his fingers from the beleaguered counter and ushering him toward the living room so they could sit close together and keep their voices down.

""The things Buck did today--breaking into Clint's apartment, snooping through his things, stealing, lying to Pepper to sneak away, hiding in the vents, the pornography, then trying to hide it from us--those are  all  on me. I haven't been keeping up with his spiritual education and proper discipline--""

""Bullshit.""

""Natasha--""

""No. That's bullshit. He's a happy, healthy,  curious  little boy. A  normal  little boy. His family--such as it is--hasn't set the best example for him and that's not on you. We need to step up our involvement, too. Clint doesn't even  lock  his door anymore because I break in all the time to remove his light bulbs and rearrange his furniture when he sleeps without his hearing aids.""

That surprised a laugh out of Steve. Encouraged by the slight shift in his dark mood, she began listing the steps that had been taken in his absence to prevent a recurrence of the day's more troubling events. ""We started working on it while you were out. Clint and Tony boxed up Dumbass' porn collection and stashed it in a weapons locker on Clint's floor for now. Jarvis ordered a vault to install in Clint's no-no closet to store all of his adult paraphernalia for the interim, including the weapons he should have secured after the incident in the common room. He has been thoroughly chastised,"" she said with feeling. ""We also cleared my apartment of all the remaining weapons and booby traps, stored all the nonessentials in another weapons locker on my floor, and I packed up the essentials to move down here on a more permanent basis--if you'll have me.""

She pointed to the small stack of luggage beside the front door and waited. Steve did not disappoint, scooping her up into his lap for a kiss that left them both panting for air when they parted. ""Does that mean you're movin' in or that I'm a hopeless mess who needs supervison?""

""Moving in. For as long as you need me.""

""And if I need you forever?""

""Forever's a long time,"" she demurred, then smiled, ""but I could be persuaded.""

But Steve's smile was the smile of the truly happy. ""I told Sam once I didn't know what made me happy. I really was a mess back then. God knows what he thought of Captain Sad-sack Everything-is-Terrible."" He chuckled. ""But if he asked me now...""

She smiled and touched her lips to his again. ""Happy?""

""Happiest, maybe,"" He wagged his head back and forth, still obviously troubled by the conversation with the priest.

""I know you're worried about doing right by Bucky, but Frigga did say the spell would wear off, not that it's permanent,"" she reminded him gently. ""We have no evidence to suggest when he returns to his proper age that he'll even remember what's happening now, or that he would forget being raised with you the first time. I understand you feel like you need to try to raise him the way your mothers raised both of you, but the Catholic Church is different now. It preaches very different things, things you take exception to. Don't you think your mothers would have taken exception, too?""

""I wish I knew."" He he laid his forehead against hers and they sat, quietly sharing breath for a few moments. ""What do you think I should do? I value your opinion and I know the way I was raised is not the only way to do this.""

""An invite was delivered today that might be a good place to start,"" she began. ""Pepper helped me bring my luggage down earlier. She wanted to apologize for letting Bucky give her the slip--""

""That's hardly her fault! He told her he was going to the bathroom and his excuse is that he  did  go, but he decided to go for a walk afterward, to check out the penthouse and that's when he found the vents."" He shook his head.

""Well, she realized he'd been gone a bit longer than any little boy really needed to be alone in the bathroom and she was just going to check on him when Jarvis notified her that he'd been caught climbing in the vents.""

""Ugh. I should apologize to her. There's a daycare center for SI employees in the building that he'd have a much harder time sneaking away from. I should have--""

""No. He's still James Barnes and that puts him at risk, no matter how well we vet people in the building outside the team. Pepper was the right call this time. Next time, whoever stays behind with Pepper will be sitting on top of Bucky the whole time, simple as that. We'll take turns, if needed--make it work.""

Steve exhaled like he'd been holding his breath for a week. ""Thanks, Nat.""

Another kiss, then, ""When I told her where the two of you went, Pepper also asked me to extend an invitation to you and Bucky to attend church with her and Darcy, if you'd like to check out some modern congregations. There's a UUC in Brooklyn that she likes and she thinks Darcy's been enjoying their Sunday school.""

""UUC?""

""Unitarian Universalist Congregation, an inclusive, multi-faith church with a humanist approach to religion and its role in community. I think Pepper's right; it might be more in keeping with what you believe now and it could provide a good foundation for you and Bucky going forward.""

""You did all this while I was getting the put-your-best-friend-up-for-adoption talk from Father Michael?""

 ""Excuse me?""  Nat's eyes flashed with righteous fury, her muscles suddenly taut and ready to spring.

Steve glanced over his shoulder toward the hallway. ""That's why Bucky's so upset, why  I  came back so upset."" He swallowed and his lip trembled, and Nat seriously considered burning down a man's church. ""He suggested Bucky might be better off with a proper Catholic family, if I'm not willing to do what's best for his spiritual well-being.""

""Fuck that. No one is taking our--"" Her breath heaved and her heart clenched. Absolutely not, not happening. ""No one is taking Bucky from us. We'll all go to Pepper's church this Sunday. Obviously, I need some Jesus, too, or I wouldn't be thinking about burning down Father Michael's demented house of worship.""

""Your restraint is very appealing, you know,"" he said, making a conscious effort to switch gears and lighten the mood for both of their sakes. Pressing kisses to the warm flush on her cheeks and down her throat, he slid the light blazer off her shoulders and slipped his fingers under the silky camisole strap beneath.

Natasha groaned, putting her hands on his chest to hold him off a bit longer. ""Bath and bedtime, first. Then you can worship my restraint,"" she reminded her lover before climbing to her feet.

When they opened the door to Bucky's room together, they found him lying on the floor under his platform bed, curled in a ball with his quilt, tear tracks staining his sleeping face. His tie was loose and his good church clothes a wrinkled mess.

""Aw, Buck."" Steve slid his arms under the brawny little body of his best friend and hugged him close.

""You'we not reawwy gonna thend me away, are ya, pal?"" Bucky surprised him in a sniffling voice, shaking with emotion. He slid his arms over Steve's shoulders and buried his face in Steve's neck.

""No, Bucky, not ever."" Steve squeezed him just a little bit tighter, swaying gently to soothe away the heartache the artless, single-minded words of the priest caused them both. ""And I'm not going to raise you in a church that thinks you'd be better off without your only family because I ain't Catholic up to snuff anymore. It ain't right. Miss Pepper invited us to her church and Miss Nat's going to check it out with us this weekend. It sounds real nice.""

""Tho I can thtay?"" His worried, little voice wobbled as Steve settled in the oversized reading chair in the corner.

""A'course, pal. That was never in doubt. Miss Nat and I haven't had a chance to talk about it yet, but I think it might be time to draw up some legal guardianship papers, kind of like Darcy and Mr. Stark's adoption, just to be on the safe side. It'll make both of us your guardians, so you can stay with Miss Nat if anything happens to me before you grow up or get big again."" His gaze flickered up to hers in the darkened room.

""I'd like that, too,"" she said, perching on the arm of the chair to run her hand through Bucky's damp hair. ""We'd be family, a real one this way, if you like. You could call me just Nat, or Aunt Nat.""

""If Thteebie'th my betht pal and wike my bro'ver, what'th that make you?""

""Your big sister, Nat, then."" She smiled when his eyes widened in surprise.

""I never had a big thithter befo'.""

""Well, you do now."" She bundled him into her arms and sighed when Steve's slipped around them both.

 

Check out the end note of Chapter 13 over on my tumblr for a primer on Bucky's Lisp (because it is ridiculously long for an end note on AO3).

One-word prompt: swing

Breakfast the next morning came hours earlier than usual, with a side of painfully awkward.

Not because of their newfound understanding about becoming a family, but because Bucky woke up in the middle of the night and followed the strange sounds that roused him from sleep.

Right to Steve and Nat's bedroom.

Needless to say, Bucky got an eyeful of his big brother and sister doing a very grownup thing, along with a hard-won lesson about knocking on doors, no matter what he thought might be happening to Steve on the other side.

""I'm reaw thorry, Nat. I didn't mean to thnap a' ya wike dat. It'th jutht... I thought you wath hurtin' 'im the way Thteebie wath hollerin' and breavin' tho hawd that I heawd 'im cawwyin' on down da hall. He coulda been dyin!"" he explained at top volume.

To his navel.

Because he couldn't quite look anyone in the eye just yet. Bucky's face might have turned permanently red, too, but neither of the adults could tell the way he had his chin buried in his chest and his eyes trained on his lap like his life depended on it.

Natasha sat across the table with a bemused smile in her eyes and a hand over her mouth, elbow on the table, clad only in a thin, silk robe hurriedly donned as Steve hustled a stunned Bucky out of their room ten minutes earlier. Then and there, they decided to sit down with hot drinks around the kitchen table and hold their first family meeting.

Taking a deep breath, Nat started the difficult conversation. ""This is a teachable moment for all of us. That's what it's called, right, Jarvis?""

The speaker overhead crackled to life, ""Indeed, Agent Romanoff.""

""Boundaries and family rules; we need to establish some and all agree to follow them. Do the two of you agree?"" She looked from Bucky to Steve, then jerked her head to indicate he should do more than nod or sit there, doing an impression of a tomato, he supposed.

""That's a good idea. Don't you think so, Buck?"" Steve nudged his elbow, but all Bucky could do was nod vehemently. ""Buck?""

With a sudden burst of noise and emphatic gestures, all of Bucky's concerns for Steve's eternal soul poured forth, ""What about Jethuth' ruleth? We jutht got back fwom thurthch an' you an' Nat awen't mawwied an' ya aweady thinnin' again, Thteebie! Father Micha'th gonna give you tho many Hail Mawyth and Ou' Fatherth, ya gonna be on ya kneeth unti'  nextht  Chrithmath! We're a'ppothed ta be on ou' betht behaviuh and pwayin' for' guidanthe!""

""Excuse me,"" Natasha whispered with trembling lips, trying desperately not to laugh. She slipped quickly from the room, flame-red hair swinging long and loose to the middle of her back.

""Uh oh. Nat'th not mad, ith thee?"" Bucky worried, chewing on his lip with a glance down the hall.

""No, pal. I think she was chilly. Probably went to throw on a sweater.""

""Thee did wook awfuw cold. I mean, befor', when ya wath hoggin' all da bwanketth and wifout any of hew clotheth on an' all--""

""Buck."" Steve waited for Bucky to look him in the eye. ""Enough.""

""Yeth, thir."" Bucky subsided to glare at the table and trace the whorls in the wood grain with his stubby fingertip.

Leaning forward, Steve propped his arms on the table and steepled his fingers. ""Nat's right about rules and boundaries. We need to discuss consequences, too, I think. We're not mad about what happened just now. It was our responsibility to remind you to always knock on closed doors and we forgot to do that  and  lock our door, but you gotta remember what we do behind that door is no one's business but ours, Buck. I'm an adult now; the condition of my soul is my worry alone."" He tapped Bucky gently on the nose in mild reprimand. ""I promise to be more careful about locking the door in the future and I'm sure Nat will say the same--""

""Same!"" Nat called out from behind the closed door to the master bedroom. ""I'll do better, too, James!""

Bucky smiled--a faint one, but a smile all the same.

""But that doesn't let you off the hook for the stunt you pulled yesterday, young man, and we still have to discuss that."" Steve leveled his most serious look on his little buddy. ""You have some apologies to make. Who do you think you should apologize to, first?""

""Mith Pepper,"" he replied without hesitation. ""Becauthe I let hew think I would be wight back and then I weft and she pwob'ly got wowwied when I di'n't come back."" He rolled his lips between his teeth in a show of nerves.

Steve nodded in encouragement. ""That's right. Who else?""

""Mithter Thtark becauthe I bwoke the bent cober.""

The bent... Oh, the  vent cover ...

Steve inhaled sharply, surprised Bucky admitted to something he and Nat hadn't yet discovered. ""Good. That's good. I appreciate you coming clean about that right away, Bucky. Good job. Who else?""

""Mithter Bawton becauthe I bwoke into hith apar'ment and took hith naked lady bookth.""

""Books? More than one?"" Steve shouldn't have been surprised.

Bucky nodded and hung his head in shame. ""An' I'm thorry to Nat, too, becauthe I bwoke all hew fun booby twapth for Mithter Bawton an' weft a bunthch of naked wady pictthu' bookth in hew theilin'. Thorry, Nat.""

His bottom lip poked out and his eyes widened in sincere contrition when Nat stopped beside his chair (dressed more conservatively for the day in dark cargos and a blue sweatshirt, artfully ripped and draped to bare one shoulder and cover the rest).

She offered him a hug as they exchanged apologies. ""We'll all get better at this, James. It'll take time and patience, just like any family,"" she promised. ""There's someone you forgot on your apology list, though."" She pointed to the ceiling as she let go and crossed to the coffeepot.

""Oh, wight."" Bucky looked at the security camera in the corner. ""I'm thorry, Mithter Jarvith, that..."" He looked to Nat and Steve, trying to determine exactly what all he should apologize for before making his best effort with, ""I'm thorry I wathted ya time, yethterday, an' that Mithter Thtark pwob'ly had ta we-pwogwam ya to tattle when I'm bad."" He looked really, genuinely sad about that part.

Steve's heart melted when Jarvis replied and Bucky's shoulders dropped in relief. ""Apology accepted, Master Barnes, and you're forgiven, of course. I trust you've learned some valuable lessons from your mistakes?""

""Boy, hab I!"" Bucky answered with a deep, heartfelt exhalation, eyes wide and just a little wild from all he'd seen.

One-word prompt: pineapple

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

The sound of the elevator approaching the foyer made Bucky stand up a little straighter on the step stool Stevie pulled up to the counter so Bucky could get his hands in the wad of dough they were mixin' up for apology cookies.

Stevie's ma always said apologies went best with a gift of your time to show you were really tryin' to make an effort to be good, and Bucky's ma agreed. That's how come Stevie got so good at drawin' pictures when he was five--he had the sassiest mouth in the whole neighborhood, so he got in trouble a LOT and had to apologize to his ma and Bucky's ma for his bad temper almost every day. He drew pictures inside cards since he couldn't write his letters yet.

Bucky sure did miss his ma, even if she would have agreed with Stevie's punish--

No, not punishment. Stevie said he wasn't bein'  punished.  He was learnin' the consequences of misbehavin'. Consequences were important because it meant you had to pay some kind of penance for misbehavin' and one of them penances was takin' responsibility for apologizin' in person and if you knew the consequences in advance, you was less likely to misbehave in the first place.

So they baked cookies for consequences and Bucky didn't get to have a single one. Looking at the bowl of soft pineapple cookie dough, Bucky had a pretty good idea how this could be a consequence he'd remember next time he thought about bein' bad. Not gettin' any cookies you helped bake was  awful. 

""Hi Miss Nat! Can Bucky come out to play?""

Darcy!

Bucky wobbled on the stool, but caught himself on the counter before scrambling down the little steps. He was halfway across the kitchen before Stevie cleared his throat. Stopping in his tracks, Bucky turned around and there was Stevie with his eyebrows all the way up his big head, lookin' at Bucky like he forgot something.

""Buck?"" Stevie pointed to the footstool. ""We ain't done here yet, pal.""

Oh. He cast a longing glance at Darcy and her pop standing in the foyer, talking with Nat. Darcy hopped from foot to foot like she was excited and Bucky was just  dyin'  to know why. Behind them sat a shiny red wagon with a big, green bow on the handle. A basket full of shiny gold things sat in the wagon, near the back.

He sighed. Bucky sure missed his Radio Flyer right about now, too.

""Buck? Come on, buddy. You can play after you've taken care of your consequences."" Stevie held out a fancy scoop with a clicker on the side to make all the cookies close to the same size. ""I'll tell you what--before Darcy and Mr. Stark leave, you can say hi and make plans to play with Darcy later this afternoon, after you make all your apologies.""

Trying to keep a solemn face without letting on how excited he was about playin' with Darcy later, Bucky nodded real serious like and got back to work, scoopin' cookies. The dough smelled so good. Bucky frowned. This was worse than any punishment, knowing other people was gonna eat all these delicious cookies and, even if they offered him one, he had to say ""no thank you, I'm not allowed to eat apology cookies"". Every time he even thought about havin' to say it out loud, he died a little bit inside.

Not that he didn't love Stevie and all, but he definitely was  not  Bucky's favorite person right now. Maybe not at all today, even.

Grumbling, he scooped cookies with a little more force than was probably necessary until Stevie reminded him the cookies had to be edible or they'd have to start all over again.

Bucky wanted to swear SO BAD. He knew some real doozies now, too. Agent Barton said all the best swear words and used a bunch of 'em every time he got hurt.

Agent Barton got hurt a LOT, too.

But Bucky'd probably have to give away even more cookies if he said 'em out loud.

Didn't keep him from sayin' a lot of 'em in his head, though! Take that, bossy damn knowitall grown up STEVIE. He scooped a little hard again and angry-snorted loud enough to get a sharp look from Stevie, so he tried to cool it, but ... ugh.  Cookies. 

""Last batch is goin' in, Buck,"" Stevie said as he slid the last cookie sheet in the oven and set the timer. ""Go on and say hi to Darcy."" Stevie waved him into the living room.

""Darthy!"" he cried, running through the living room to the foyer and pulling up short when Darcy fished a sparkly gold thing out of the basket to hand to him with a pretty smile.

She said hi.

So Bucky said hi and nearly squeezed the stuffin' out of the sparkly gold thing because he got distracted by the wagon's pristine white wheels. It looked brand new, like a picture in the Sears & Roebuck at Christmastime.

""It's a Christmas cracker,"" Darcy was explaining the sparkly package while Bucky's attention was divided. ""You pull on da ends and fun stuff pops out."" Game to give it a try, Bucky gripped both ends in his fists and yanked.

POP!!! went the glittery cracker.

Everywhere went the glitter.

It was in his eyelashes.

In his MOUTH.

It was not as fun as advertised, that's for sure.

He sputtered red and green flecks, accidentally spitting some in Darcy's hair when she bent over to pick up a piece of paper that fell out of the cracky tube. Whoops. Maybe she wouldn't notice and, besides, what's a little spit between friends?

""Push da button!"" She danced in excitement in a circle around him, pigtails flailing, as he looked frantically for the button on the device fixed to top of the note.

""HO, HO, HO. MERRY CHRISTMAS,"" Darcy's Uncle Colonel Rhodey's voice boomed from the note.

AND HOLY COW. HE'S LOUD.

""COME ONE, COME ALL, TO A VERY MERRY STARKMAS IN NEW YORK. YOU'RE INVITED TO JOIN THE STARK FAMILY--"" Mr. Stark, Miss Potts, Uncle Col. Rhodey, Uncle Happy, and Darcy all chimed in to say their names one after the other on the recording, ""Tony , Pepper ,  Rhodey  , Happy, and  Darcy   for an Avengers family--"" The Stark family all chimed in again to name each of their special holidays. "" --Christmas,Yule,   Chanukah  ,   Kwanzaa  --  what's a Kwanzaa?  --  I'll explain later, sweetie  -- and Festivus, the holiday for the rest of us!-- in upstate New York at the former Great Camp Stark in the Adirondack Mountains. Pack plenty of warm clothes, books, and toys because we're staying for the rest of December! Air and ground transportation have been taken care of. All you need to do is pack and arrive on the quinpad at the appointed time. We'll take care of the rest! HO, HO, HO, and Happy Holidays!""

Bucky stood there, staring at the note for a few more seconds, then asked, ""What was  that? ""

""An inbitation to go on bacation wif us, Bucky!"" Darcy pirouetted happily around the living room in her blue high-top sneakers with a huge, happy grin on her face. Thor's cape--wrapped over her shoulder and around her middle--spun out in a wide fan of uneven pleats. ""You, and Captain Steve, and Miss Nat, too!"" She stopped spinning and rushed Bucky, grabbing him above the elbows and bouncing on her toes. ""Aren't you excited?!""

 Please, please, please say we can go,  Bucky closed his eyes and wished real hard,  even though I did all the bad things. Aw, man... Really a lot of bad things,  now that he thought about it.

""I don't know if I'mma be awowwed to go,"" he said sadly, retreating a step. ""I gotta make awotta apowogies firtht."" He screwed up his face, but tears prickled at his eyes anyway. ""An' if an'body offerth me a tweat today, I'm a'ppothed to thay no thank you."" He scuffed his toe against the floor. ""I think thith countth ath a tweat.""

And not cryin' felt a loss worse than cryin' about it, if he was honest.

""James."" Nat dropped to one knee between him and Darcy. ""Once you make your apologies, you've made amends for yesterday. We wouldn't keep you from going on a special family Christmas trip, too, sweetheart. Okay?"" Her fingers felt like somethin' really soft when they touched his chin to get him to look at her.

He sniffled and rubbed a hand under his nose. Mr. Stark handed him a shop rag. That was nice. ""Thankth, Mithter Thtark. I alwayth fo'get about da Kweenex and nobody habth hankieth no mo'."" He wiped his nose real good and stuffed the yucky rag in his pocket to put in the wash later.

""Hey, we almost forgot!"" Mr. Stark said, turning to grab the basket out of the wagon. ""You got a delivery. We took advantage and brought it up from the mailroom ourselves,"" he said, wheeling the wagon around in a big circle in front of Bucky.

""Huh?"" He blinked in confusion at Mr. Stark.

""There's a card, too,"" Mr. Stark said. He snapped it open and read it out loud, "" 'Dearest James Buchanan, I seem to remember every little boy needs one of these to go about the business of being a boy. I do hope you enjoy it, but please don't knock out more teeth this time. Happy Christmas. Your friend, Peggy Carter'.""

""My teef?"" Bucky ran his tongue over the spot where his teeth used to be. ""An' who'th Peggy Cawter?""

""An old friend from the Army, pal."" Stevie stooped down to run his hand over the Radio Flyer. ""When you were big, you told her the story of how you knocked out the next two teeth in your mouth. Had a four-wide gap for ages back then."" He tapped the wagon's plastic side. ""They don't make 'em the way they used to, huh?"" 

""Wait..."" Bucky stared at the wagon and the note in Mr. Stark's hand. ""The wagon'th fo' me?""

Mr. Stark nodded. ""My Aunt Peggy asked Jarvis to keep her apprised of any news regarding ... her friends in the tower. Aunt Peggy is an old friend of Steve's."" He cleared his throat, then lifted a black case out of the wagon, too. ""This is from another family friend, Major Dugan.""

Inside the black case was a real Daisy BB air rifle.

""Wow."" Bucky almost couldn't talk, he was so excited. ""Thith ith fo' me, too?""

""Yup. We invited Major Dugan and some old friends from the hundred-and-seventh up to Camp Stark for the holidays, too, but they can't make it. They wanted you to know they wish they could see you, but it's not possible right now, so they sent their gift ahead with Aunt Peggy's and they hope to see you next Easter here in New York.""

""I don' know what to thay. I--"" Feeling  real  guilty, he looked at Darcy with big eyes. ""We can thare, if you--""

""Darcy got a surprise from Aunt Peggy and the one-oh-seven, too, kid. No worries,"" Mr. Stark interrupted. (RUDE, but okay. Not that anyone was gonna make Mr. Stark bake cookies and give 'em away.) ""It's up in the penthouse. It was delivered yesterday, in fact.""

""What ith it?"" Bucky wanted to know.

""A toboggan sled."" Darcy's dimple deepened in her cheek when she smiled with her eyes. ""I never had one before. Aunt Peggy sent me ice skates, too, but I don't know how ta skate yet. Miss Pepper's gonna show me at the camp. There's a lake, but we can't skate on'a lake 'cause not safe, but my-- Tony said we can get out the hose and there's a big spot in the yard that we can fill up with water when it's not snowing too hard and make a ice rink and play hockey and other stuff on our bacation.""

""I never played hockey."" Bucky wasn't sore about it--not really, but Darcy got to do all kinds of neat things.

""It's fun! You take a stick and a little plastic thing and whack it  real hard  at a net and somebody else tries to stop it and if they're bad at it, they lose teef! But sometimes, you get to punch when somebody skates by you wrong, or if you just don't like da look on his face!"" She made her hands into fists and put 'em up, bouncing from foot to foot.

Mr. Stark raised his eyebrows real high. ""That is the most precious, blood-thirsty description of hockey I have ever heard. We gotta shop for more skates and face guards, bruiser,"" he said, picking Darcy up and tickling until she squealed.

""We'll check our schedules to make sure we're good to come along,"" Stevie told Mr. Stark, ""but I think it's safe to assume we all want to go...?""

Nat nodded and Bucky chewed on his lip, trying so hard to be good as he nodded his head real nice and slow so nobody could possibly mistake his answer for anything but 'yes, please, and I'll be so good forever and ever'.

""Looks like you have our answer."" Stevie smiled. ""Bucky's still gotta go make his apologies today, though. When do we leave?"" He reached for the invitation.

""Sunday afternoon--only takes about thirty-five minutes by quin, if we're not in a big hurry. Figured we'd head up after lunch, at least. Nat told Pepper you guys were interested in checking out our church--""

 ""Your  church?"" Why did Stevie look so surprised? Didn't ever'body go to some kinda church?

""Used to be just me and Pep, but Bruce, Rhodey, and Happy go with us sometimes, too."" Mr. Stark made it sound like no big deal, so it mustn't a'been one at all. ""S'where Bruce met his yoga friends. Pepper likes the people and the head of the church, Reverend Mother Evelyn. You know me--where goes Pepper, so goes my nation."" He grinned. ""She thinks it's good for me, all those nice people in close proximity rubbing off on me.""

Nat crossed her arms and made the face with the smirk Bucky liked best. ""It certainly can't hurt.""

""Hey, Buck."" Stevie jerked his head at the kitchen. ""This last batch is just about done. Come on. You can pack up the previous batch. Should be cool enough now.""

""Whatcha got cookin' there?"" Mr. Stark stood on tip-toe and peered into the kitchen around Nat.

"" 'powogy cookieth,"" Bucky grumbled, climbing up the tiny steps again and grabbing the flipper thing to move the cooled cookies from the soft towel to a plate sitting on a big circle of clear plastic.

""Bucky's going to deliver some homemade cookies when he visits everyone he needs to apologize to today,"" Stevie explained, pointing to the other plates wrapped in plastic in the box on the table.

"" It'th part of my mithb'havin' conthequentheth,"" Bucky mumbled, embarrassed to have to admit again what he did.

""Mm... I heard about that."" Mr. Stark nodded. ""Cookies are a nice way to say you're sorry. I'm sure Pepper and Clint will appreciate that a lot. Good job, kid."" Then he patted Bucky on the back.

Bucky blinked rapidly and dug his toe into the cupboard door. ""One of 'em'th yourth, too, Mithter Thtark. I di'n't mean to break da bent cober when I foun' Mithter Hawkeye'th bentilathion ductth. It jutht kinda happened.""

He excused himself through all the people gathered in the kitchen to get to the box on the table and lift out the plate with Mr. Stark's name on it. ""Thethe ar' fo' you. I'm weal thorry, Mithter Thtark. Me and Thteebie aweady talked to maintenanthe to get replathementth fo the hingeth I bwoke and I'm gonna pay fer it outta my allowanthe."" He hoisted the plate of cookies up the onto the counter, then climbed the footstool to present the plate to Mr. Stark.

Mr. Stark looked at Bucky like he was surprised, then at Stevie, then back at Bucky. ""I don't supposed he's allowed to have--""

But Stevie was already shakin' his head. ""Not this time. He's not allowed to have any of the apology cookies. Hopefully, this lesson sticks and he doesn't have to turn down yummy homemade treats again, huh, Buck?""

""Yeth, thir."" Bucky sighed. He supposed that was fair. He'd remember the cookie consequence for a long time.

Mr. Stark thanked him for the cookies and for arranging to fix the vent cover, then he and Darcy took the basket of sparkly tubes and cookies and went to deliver more invitations, but not before Darcy asked him to come over to Mr. Stark's workshop to play with the robots later. So he had  that  to look forward to.

""Ready to go make the rest of your apologies, pal?"" Stevie asked when they had all the plates of cookies loaded in his new wagon.

""Can I athk ya a quethtion befo' we go? Um..."" He glanced at Nat and ducked his head, then mumbled, ""In pwivate?""

Nat kissed him on the cheek and padded out of the room. He waited until he heard the master bedroom door click shut to look at Stevie again. ""I... I know it'th pwivate, um... What you and Nat wath doing watht night, but I got a quethtion and, um... If I don' athk now, it might be wude and mithbehavin' ta athk later...""

Stevie plucked Bucky up off the floor like he weighed nothin' and sat down on the coffee table. ""You can ask me anything, Buck, and I'll do my best to answer.""

Settling Bucky on the sofa, Stevie waited until Bucky worked up his nerve to ask, ""Ya tho much bigg'a than Nat. How'd thee pin ya when ya wath wrethtlin' wike that?""

Stevie smiled and his chest puffed like he wanted to laugh. ""She's pretty strong.""

""It... Doethn't hurt, doeth it?"" Bucky squirmed in his seat. Askin' made him uncomfortable, but he needed to make sure Stevie wasn't hurt and if it hurt-- ""I mean, I might gwow up again and wanna naked-wrethtle wif a wady or a fella, but I'm not big and thtrong wike you.""

""No, it doesn't hurt. When you're bigger and you love someone a lot and you wanna wrestle with them, too, you come tell me and I'll explain how it all works, okay, pal?""

""Yeah, yeah. That'th good. Thankth, Thteebie. Thtat'th a load off'a my mind.""

Saddle up! It's time for an Avengers mountain adventure at winter camp!

Yesterday, I posted a short fic called ""Tony's Brand of Gratitude"". It's only a few hundred words, written as an addendum to Chapter 15 and Steve's conversation with Bucky about grownups and wrestling. When you're done with this chapter--commented, kudo'd, and what have you--go check that out. It's posted in the Two Front Teef series as a bonus scene.

Barton's many pizza and beer T-shirts (and the other tees mentioned in this chapter) are all inspired by real T-shirt designs on Shirt Woot. I am not a graphic designer and I know none of the artists personally, but my 14 year old and I buy our T-shirts pretty much exclusively from Shirt Woot's awesomely creative independent artist collective. I headcanons that Barton and Pepper totally would, too. (^_^)

One-word prompt: corduroy

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

With every  rub, rub, rub,  Tony deeply regretted suggesting Darcy wear her corduroy overalls for the day since they were leaving later for the trip upstate. Why were kids clothes so noisy? She had a noisy sweater that disappeared under mysterious circumstances recently, too, not that Tony knew anything about that and no one could prove it anyway.

The quin sat on the roof and the team loaded luggage and other important recreational items while Darcy and Bucky climbed all over a pair of jump seats near the cockpit so they could see all the comings and goings as the team worked to bring up everything they'd need for the next few weeks.

From somewhere in the depths of R&D, Pepper procured a pair of booster seats with seven-point harnesses to put the safety seats on the quinjet to shame for the two children, but it was decided they'd be buckled in at the last minute so they had a chance to burn off some energy. Apparently, Darcy's noisy little corduroys made Clint's dog, Lucky bark. Darcy and Bucky thought it was hysterical and Tony suddenly had a deep appreciation for why large dogs aren't allowed on commercial planes.

It was going to be a long flight.

(Small dogs were sounding better and better, if Darcy had to have a dog. Jarvis could wrap up that little side project once they were settled in at the camp.)

Dr. Lin and his partner, Ben, were the smart ones. They took an earlier flight up north with Rhodey in the commuter plane Howard once preferred.

""Hey, Mithter Bawton, what'th that?""

Tony turned just in time to watch Barton ride a sky blue unicycle up the gangway in a pair of cargos and combat boots with a motorcycle jacket pulled on over one of his many pizza and beer T-shirts. The one he had on today said, ""Let's Get Sauced"", and featured a grinning pizza pie holding a pair of beer steins--furthering Tony's belief that Barton was secretly the fifth, forgotten Mutant Ninja Turtle in either the worst or best disguise ever. Jury was still out.

Darcy loved Barton's stupid shirts, so Pepper dove into whatever hippie artist commune he sourced them from on the internet and bought up a bunch for both kids. The shirt of the day became a point of discussion over breakfast every morning and Tony had to give Pep credit--it got Darcy talking about her interests and engaging other adults in conversation. Smart lady. If somebody had to keep a hold of his leash, Tony was glad it was Pepper.

For church that morning, which thankfully had a 'come as you are' dress code policy, Darcy chose the corduroy overalls in an eye-watering neon teal, her dark grey Galactic Gumtastic T-shirt with the solar system depicted inside a gumball machine, and a pair of burgundy Chuck Taylors. Pepper topped it off with a pretty, sequined cardigan in matching burgundy. This turned out to be Darcy's favorite outfit to date, so everyone she passed that day got a smile, a bubbly greeting, and a lengthy explanation about her favorite outfit.

Tony adored every babbling word, even if it took six times as long to go anywhere or get anything done. Deliberately engaging other adults was still such a rare occurrence for Darcy, every time she voluntarily spoke to someone other than himself or Pepper, they counted it a win.

She and Pepper were coming along, too. Darcy was nowhere near as clingy with Pepper as she was with Tony, but she started asking Pepper for bedtime stories this past week and, when the three of them woke all piled in bed together the last two mornings, Darcy had been squeezed in the middle between both of them rather than clinging to Tony like a Facehugger from the far side of the bed.

Somehow, Darcy and Bucky managed to corner Barton near the cockpit to ask him about his one-eyed dog, why his name was Lucky if he only had one eye, what happened to his other eye, why he brought his dog on vacation, why he brought a unicycle, what his archer lady friend's name was, if he had any more pizza T-shirts, if he liked Darcy's new shirt, had he seen Bucky's Hugasaurus Rex T-shirt...

Laughing, Tony returned to stacking and securing luggage in the hold, and listened in as Jarvis, Romanoff, and Wilson went through the pre-flight checklist. Pepper rattled off instructions to her administrative assistants and a pair of VPs assigned to take meetings on Pepper's behalf until her return. They could conference her in for real emergencies, but it was understood that she was going on a relaxing family vacation. Nothing short of an international incident caused by Tony himself should constitute the level of emergency that would require her to conference in. Her AAs and VPs were more than capable of holding down the fort for two or three weeks. Quick questions could be passed through Jarvis, as needed, but Jarvis had the final say on the expediency of a message's delivery method on a case by case basis. He was more than capable of discerning real emergencies from officious ass-kissing and unnecessary brown-nosing.

Rogers rolled up the gangway after everyone buckled in, pulling Bucky's red wagon full of everything a little boy might find essential for a long holiday trip in the mountains. Secured and stationary, the two men left the wagon in the cargo hold and took their spots beside the kids, buckling in wiggling bodies and trying to avoid getting a stray finger in the eye.

Romanoff's voice cut in over the PA, reminding everyone to remain in their seats during take-off and landing. Movement about the cabin was permitted after the all-clear was given. She reminded the children where the restroom was located and to ask an adult for help if they had to use it. She also reminded them that the shower in the restroom was reserved for post-mission necessity, not for playtime. There would be consequences for anyone caught playing in the quinjet shower without permission.

Bucky slumped over in his seat. ""Ugh, not conthequentheth. Thothe a' the wortht.""

Steve laughed and raised a hand in the air, circling his finger overhead to signal Romanoff to take off.

""Ready to go?"" Tony asked the kids.

Darcy all but bounced out of her skin and Bucky perked up.

""Whatta we gonna do when we get thewe?"" he asked.

""The camp superintendent will give everyone a map of the facilities so you know where to find what you need and where to go when we make special plans for the day. You'll get your guest room or cottage assignment and unpack, maybe have a bite to eat, then go check out the farm and explore.""

""Thewe'th a farm?""

""Sure! A real working one, too, with draft horses, pigs, chickens, probably some peacocks, goats, and sheep. There's a big lodge with a dining hall, a private movie theater, a brewery that makes grownup beer and a soft drink kids can drink called birch beer, an outdoor bowling alley, a treehouse, a building just for games like billiards and ping-pong, and lots of other fun things. You're gonna love it,"" Tony assured the youngsters. Even as a lonely rich kid with emotionally absent parents, the camp was one of the few places Tony could remember making friends as a child. Come to think of it, he wondered if Rosa ever had kids and whether Bucky and Darcy would find new playmates at the camp, too. If nothing else, Hulk would enjoy the change of scenery when the kids coaxed Banner to transform for playtime.

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

Sorry for the delay! I had some other holiday writing commitments to wrap up today. Early this morning, I posted my Darcyland Secret Santa fic, A Good, Old Fashioned Family Starkmas(tm). It's a little funny, occasionally sarcastic, very fluffy, with little bits of romance, angst, and domesticity, and plenty of WinterShieldShock and Tony & Darcy banter. It was inspired by National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. If you enjoy this story, there's a good chance you'll love A Good, Old Fashioned Family Starkmas(tm), too. 

One-word prompt: pound

Hockey was a complete disaster.

Well, maybe not a disaster, and calling it 'hockey' was a bit of a misnomer, anyway. The new, improvised ice rink was mostly salvageable, at least. A little cleaning and scraping, some more water to lay down a fresh layer of ice ... good as new.

It started with a request.

""Dr. Bruce, can Hulk come out to play?"" Darcy and Bucky chorused, standing by the door to the lodge as Steve and Tony bundled them into their snowsuits. Watching over the process with Natasha, Bruce observed his other self's playmates with detached amusement. Not that he didn't enjoy the children, but even if he went out to play with them in the snow, he would do it as the Hulk, and the memories would remain dim and distant. It seemed to be good for the Other Guy, though, and he told Tony as much. His thoughts had never been so calm, the rage never more controlled. The kids were bundled up so tight, they could hardly move. Hulk was going to be very confused if he didn't immediately recognize them in their snow gear.

Not that getting into their snow gear was going particularly smoothly after pounding down the extra sugary snack served in the dining hall shortly after their arrival. Apple pie and caramel ice cream, both made by Rosa, the camp superintendent's wife and one of a very few friends Tony could truly claim he grew up with, thanks to the dreaded corporate trips to Camp Stark. They caught up over pie, and Rosa, delighted to meet Pepper at last, happily served up seconds to all of their guests, including seconds of sugary pie and ice cream to two children who'd been cooped up, first, in Sunday School for the morning at church, and second, on a small jet for most of the afternoon. (The trip was only thirty-five minutes, but they circled for another two hours while visibility in the mountains prevented a safe landing and the ground crew frantically cleared fresh falling snow from the quin pad at the air strip.)

Inside the main lodge, where everyone reconvened after unpacking and snack time, Darcy giggled and stomped every time the soles of her snow boots lit up. Bucky wiggled and snorted until Steve had to pin him down to get his hook and ladder suit done up and weather-proof boots pulled up to his knees.

The plan was to go explore the grounds, let the kids burn off some excess energy between now and dinner, try to wear them out before bed so everybody would sleep well on their first night and wake up ready and raring to go for their first full day at the lodge in the morning. Simple enough, right?

""Okay, but wha' happenth if I gotta pee?"" Bucky mumbled into the scarf wrapped around his head until nothing remained visible but his steel-blue eyes.

""Don't,"" Steve and Tony said together.

""Theriouthly."" Bucky quit moving for once and stared at them, conveying as much worry as he could with only wide eyes and stillness.

""Seriously."" Tony took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the fireplace. ""If you absolutely  have  to go, there will be at least half a dozen people in here, sitting around with nothing better to do, drinking coffee and reading books while they decide how much of nothing they're going to do on vacation tomorrow. We will point you at the door to the lodge and one of these fine people will get you out of the snowsuit in a hurry."" He pointed to the gathering of people sprawled out around the fireplace.

Barton lay on the floor, using Pizza Dog as a pillow, both of them snoring. His friend and protege, Kate, paged through an outdated book on Adirondack winter sports she discovered in the ancient library. Rhodey and Pepper chatted happily with Rosa and her husband, Tom. Sam shared a cozy loveseat with Rosa's oldest daughter, Emma, home for the holidays from her second year at NYU. Dr. Lin and his partner, Dr. Bennet McCloud, a former pediatric orthopedic surgeon, laughed over a game of checkers at a game table by a picture window. Both technically retired, Tony found it much easier to convince them to come upstate than expected. Though he suspected Pepper smoothed the way with a lucrative contract for their assistance, he also remembered well the handful of severe injuries he suffered at the lodge over the years. Dr. Lin was probably hedging his bets.

Prowling around the grand staircase, Natasha checked her phone several times, clucked her tongue, and gave Tony a look that could mean only one thing: Darcy's and Bucky's surprise was here. Natasha made a motion with her hand that he took to mean she was running over to the airstrip to round it up. Unfortunately, Pepper noticed and followed Natasha out the back door. That couldn't end well.

Well... What's done is done. Pepper was always going to find out eventually anyway.

""Can we go see da camp now, Tony?"" Darcy begged, tugging on his ski pants.

""Sure thing, kiddo."" He swung her up in his arms and held the door open for Steve and Bucky. ""Let's go check out the Rec Pavilion, first. It's a funny place. Grandpa Howard used to hunt all over the world and send his trophies back, stuffed and mounted, to display here at the lodge. Grandma Maria hated them, though, so she banished them to the Rec Pavilion--what we'd probably call a rec room or a man cave now.""

""Man cave?"" Darcy giggled.

""We'll clear out all of Grandpa's dusty old critters and turn it into a clubhouse for you and your buddy. The ceilings probably have high enough clearance for a trampoline. There's a small theater stage at one end of the room, a ping-pong table, a pool table, probably room for new foosball and air hockey tables, maybe a few pinball machines..."" Now that he thought about it, a clubhouse for the kids had potential. Hell, they'd never get Barton out of the building once it was overhauled. He might string up a pair of hammocks in the rafters for him and his dog so they never had to leave. They'd need to install safety locks with biometric access on the lakeside of the building with the swim and sun dock, but that was only an hour or two's work.

Curls of dust billowed in concentric circles as they stomped into the darkened pavilion and let the door slam at their backs.  ""Is dat an alligator?"" Darcy squeaked, tiptoeing around the oddity to poke at the flimsy tray it held out to make a grotesque sort of table. She unwrapped and readjusted Thor's cape, throwing one end of it over Bucky's shoulders as they stood in the center of the room, taking in all of Howard's worst decorating decisions, the thick layer of dust lying on every surface, and the fascinating loft over the pavilion's rarely used kitchen, strung with pennant flags in a rainbow of faded colors.

Tony curled his lip. ""Ugh, I don't remember it being this bad. We'll roll up our sleeves and start clearing out all this crap first thing tomorrow, kid. After I put together some locks for the doors here."" He tapped on the door and it swung open, unimpeded by even a basic latch mechanism. ""I'll need to check the structural integrity of the decking, too. This is ... a good project."" Yup. And he might have to break out the pair of toolboxes he'd picked up for tiny hands intended as Christmas presents a bit early. Nobody made one in Darcy's favorite eye-piercing teal, so he painted one himself. Bucky's little toolbox got a nice coat of Dodgers Blue, too. Heh. He couldn't wait to set the kids loose on the Rec Pavilion in their tiny overalls and work boots. He always wished his dad would let him make some changes to the old lakeside barn. Now that he had the chance, he looked forward to seeing what Darcy made of the echoing clubhouse space to turn it into her own domain.

(For now, he'd save the news about the cottage he planned on giving her at the lodge for when she grew up again. If things progressed with Big Barnes on the same trajectory they'd set before the lab accident, they might like to have their own place to get away up north from time to time.)

He sent a quick text to Pepper: ""The Rec Pavilion is a shit hole. I would not be surprised if animals are currently nesting in here. Barton would love it as is, that's how bad it is. All of Howard's taste was in his mouth. How long will it take to get new furniture delivered? 4 sofas, 6 upholstered chairs, a couple of game table & chair sets, a foosball table, and air hockey.""

""Tomorrow morning, if I let Jarvis make all the decisions,"" came her reply. ""Color preferences?""

""Dark, something that can resist stains, but won't show much dirt. Outdoorsy, but not Davy Crockett.""

""Natasha wants to know why I'm laughing. No Davy Crockett. Got it. Lakeside boathouse chic. Jarvis can make it happen.""

""Fuck it,"" Tony tapped back. ""Have him order a new pool table and a replacement for the ping-pong table, too, before someone dies of Tetanus from looking at these dinosaurs too long. And I need some options for an independent heating system, too. The fireplace alone won't cut it down here anymore.""

""I'm conferencing Jarvis in on this chat.""

The A.I.'s icon appeared on screen. ""How may I assist?""

""Jarvis, go nuts: kids furniture, play kitchens, tricked out mini golf carts, the works. I want this to look like Darcyland and Fort Bucky when you're done. If you think they'd like it, order it. I'll add more rooms, if need be.""

""Tony, you're being ridiculous,"" Pepper typed. ""She's not going to be five forever.""

""It's worth every penny, even if it's only a week. Do it, Jarvis.""

""You heard the man, Jarvis. Use Tony's slush fund for everything not covered by the lodge's expense account and I'll work out the rest.""

""You're the best, Pep.""

""Don't think I don't know it.""

A long pause followed. Tony listened to Darcy and Bucky chattering under Thor's cape on one of the ratty sofas while Steve wandered into the kitchen. The ladder to the loft above crumbled in his hand when he touched it as he passed by.

""Jesus."" Tony inspected the crumbled wood dusting Steve's palm. ""We'll look for termite and wood worm damage in the morning, too. Let's get out of here before someone falls through the floor.""

""Good idea.""

Just as he turned the latch to close the door and look for the empty field they used to fill for ice skating, his phone pinged with another incoming text from Pepper. ""Explain to me why a three-legged husky just bolted out of the jet Hill landed five minutes ago. It launched itself at Natasha. She's baby-talking to it in Russian.""

Tony waited.

Another text: ""Holy shit.""

More silence.

Then, ""ANTHONY EDWARD STARK"".

Tony turned off his phone. Some conversations were better held in person.

""Let's see if we can't find that ice rink. Rosa said Tom filled it in a few days ago before the latest storm. Dum-E should have it mostly cleared by now, unless he ran into--""

Tony stopped, stumbling when Steve and Bucky ran into him and Darcy from behind. Ahead, Dum-E was struggling to clear the ice in the former cranberry bog because one very large, very green person lay in the middle of it in his Loki-branded Hulk-out pants.

Making snow angels.

He coughed a laugh when Steve's phone click-click-clicked, snapping photo after photo of their teammate playing in the snow with the robots.

Steve shrugged. ""Is it weird that I got accustomed to asking Jarvis to take pictures? Now I take pictures of everything he misses,"" he explained.

""No arguments here. That's going on the Initiative Christmas cards this year. Text it to Jarvis.""

""BRONY."" Hulk sat up, shaking off snow like an overgrown puppy.

""Hey, Big Green. Havin' fun with the bots?""

""SNOW."" He snorted, digging his heels into the ice. ""PUNY GOD."" He pointed to the impressions he'd made in the ice that looked suspiciously like the impressions left in the granite floor of the penthouse on Hulk's favorite day ever.

""Oh... Snow Puny Gods, like snow angels, but with more unconscious Loki?"" Tony asked.

Hulk grinned and dipped his head once in assent.

""Good work, Big Green."" Tony held up a hand to high-five. Hulk obliged. ""Looks just like the penthouse floor."" And it was only a small corner of the rink that he'd torn up. Control, just like they discussed. And all of it easily patched with a little water.

Darcy and Bucky scooted out onto the ice in their snow boots, slipping and sliding and giggling until they bumped into Hulk's legs, gripping him below the knees. The tail-end of Thor's cape swirled around Darcy across the ice, sending little puffs of snow skittering away as the cape's natural static electricity repulsed the fluffy particles.

""You wanna play hockey, too, Hulk?"" Darcy asked.

""HOCKEY."" Hulk's brow furrowed. ""WHAT HOCKEY?""

""Like tennis, but wif sticks and a little..."" Darcy looked around. ""Oh no! We forgot our stuff!"" She turned to Tony. ""Daddy, we forgot our--"" She stopped and sucked in a surprised breath.

Tony blinked hard, willing away the burn of something ridiculous like tears. He wasn't going to cry, holy shit.


 Daddy. 


All smiles, Steve's knowing gaze met his over the the folds of his half face mask. A half-mask that looked a lot like something grownup Darcy knitted.

Darcy. Who just called Tony 'Daddy'.

He smiled, swallowing the lump in his throat. ""We did. We forgot the hockey equipment. We'll have to get one of those temporary equipment sheds set up down here so it doesn't happen again."" He waited to see what she would so.

Biting her lip, she let go of Big Green and scooted across the ice, Thor's cape sweeping and bunching the fresh fallen snow in her wake. Tony met her half-way. How could he not?

Hulk watched with growing interest. ""WHAT DADDY?"" he asked Bucky, but Bucky's chapped lips puckered in a weird little boy smirk and he shook his head. ""CAPTAIN,"" Hulk bellowed, gesturing to Darcy and Tony.

Tony didn't see the gesture, but he could guess Steve stood behind him, waving off Big Green while Tony accepted his first hug as Daddy. He exhaled against her hood and wished there weren't thirty layers of neoprene and fleece between them so he could feel her heartbeat and breath as he held her tight, but this would do. For now.

But she was getting all the bedtime stories tonight, come hell or high water.

Then it was over like it was no big deal, and Darcy asked if they could make a nice hard snowball to show Hulk how to play, like Pong, but with snow. Tony set her down and she promptly began packing a lopsided lump of her own.  

Just ... like it was really no big deal. Like ... she called him Daddy every day.

""Right."" He clapped his gloved hands together. ""Snow Pong. How hard can it be? It's basically soccer, on ice, with a giant ball of snow. We don't even need sticks. We can just kick the snowball or push it."" He snorted a laugh. ""We'll call it Hulkey--"" Hulk's challenging roar stopped him cold. ""Problem, Big Green?""

""BRONY. CAPTAIN. ONE TEAM."" He gestured to the two adults across the ice. ""HULK. KIDS. OTHER TEAM.""

Steve raised an eyebrow and looked at Tony as Darcy executed an excellent running slide across the rink.


 Why you lookin' at me, Rogers? It wasn't my idea. 


Down the ice, Darcy and Bucky assumed Hulk-like stances and roared, too.

Fabulous.

Hulk wanted to play, with bonus pants-crapping roars from time to time just to keep Tony on his toes.

Steve patted a snowball in his hands, then rolled it in the growing pile of snow on the edge of the rink near where the bots parked themselves to watch the game. Dum-E dropped his plow in the snow, pushing and pulling to clear himself a parking space with room to spare. Butterfingers barged in on it and U barreled in between, like kids fighting for the best spot on the couch.

Meanwhile, Steve rolled and rolled until he had a ball big enough for the bottom section of a really big snowman.

""Ready?"" he called, maneuvering the giant ball out to center rink.

What followed could only be called chaos.

Their friends eventually congregated on the back porch to watch the game, calling out helpful advice and really, truly unhelpful razzing.


 Think you can do better, Robin Hood? Because I am absolutely telling Hulk how sad you were that we left you out when this is over. See who razzes who next time, Merida. 


Team Greenie Smalls won by virtue of having the most determination and least self-preservation. Also, Hulk picked the snowball up and threw it because he could. So. Woo! Team Greenie Smalls!

Everything was going great. Tony couldn't remember ever having this much fun at the lodge. Then, Pepper's voice cut through the cheering like a hot knife through butter.

""ANTHONY EDWARD STARK. Where did all these puppies come from?"" Her voice hit a high note on the last word and a veritable herd of puppies swarmed from behind her and Romanoff to storm down the hill towards the kids and Big Green. ""And I'm pretty sure one of these dogs isn't even a dog! It looks like a pig!""

Four of the puppies promptly squatted and peed on the ice.

""He's an honorary dog!"" Darcy insisted, scooping up as many puppies (and honorary puppy) as she could into Thor's cape. She giggled and fell over until Bucky picked up the other end, closing most of the wiggling pups inside.

""Wow, Darth! That'th a lot of puppieth."" His eyes roved eagerly over the pack of small dogs: a shaggy chocolate labradoodle puppy with blue eyes, a Saint Bernard puppy with paws the size of the kid's head, a black & tan dachshund puppy, a brown & tan dachshund puppy, two dapple dachshund puppies, the honorary puppy, and an older pug who'd adopted and nursed the whole lot at the shelter. They came as a set as far as Tony was concerned. He wasn't about to break up a family of choice.

""One of these is yours, bud,"" Tony said, stooping over to liberate the biggest in the group, a Saint Bernard puppy, to hand over to Bucky.

""Wow, fo' weal?"" His eyes lit up as he struggled under the weight of the wriggling pup and tried to avoid having his face licked raw with enthusiasm.

""Sure thing. Figured one big one would probably be about your limit with the one Natasha brought home, too."" Tony winked and Bucky's toothless grin widened as Natasha's three-legged husky hopped around the group, barking at nothing.

""Yasha,"" she called sharply.

""E tu, Brute?"" Pepper asked, hands on hips.

Natasha shrugged. ""He reminded me of someone I knew. I couldn't leave him behind. Yasha, come love."" She patted her thigh and he hopped over, circling her with a proprietary air and scaling her body with one quick hop on the ground, a paw on her knee, and into her open arms. He lay his head over her shoulder, happily accepting her worshipful back strokes and head scratches.

""I'm just glad Bucky only wanted the one."" Steve sighed in relief, casting an amused glance at Natasha, knowing she was in on the surprise pack adoption.

""Oh, there's only one dog,"" Tony assured him, ""but the bunnies are all his, too.""

""What bunnies?""

Tony grinned.

It took all of the adults to round up the puppies and herd them towards the house. Dum-E carried the runt of the dachshund litter in Darcy's scarf suspended from his claw after the tiniest pup got stuck in snow over his head for the third time and nearly disappeared. (What Dum-E lacked in maternal instinct, he made up for with fumbling enthusiasm and a bizarre kind of ingenuity.)

Bucky's St. Bernard was the easiest, by far. Also, the only one large enough to practically  ride  back up to the lodge. Bucky and Darcy waddled in their snow suits, side by side, gently tapping their puppies' rumps to keep them hopping through the rapidly accumulating snow. They kept their voices down, but an intense discussion seemed to be underway at the same time. Potential puppy name negotiations were already in progress. Tony didn't catch all of it, but he got the gist as he rounded up and carried the three remaining dachshunds and Darcy's honorary dog, a teacup piglet. 

The cobbled together litter's mama wobbled along beside the husky and Tony couldn't tell if she was trying to mother him, too, or a little bit infatuated. Either way, Steve tripped over her enough times that he eventually gave up, scooping her up to carry her the last leg of the trip uphill.

Pepper didn't pet any dogs, except the touch-starved husky who gave no shits about Pepper's hands-off vibe. If ever there was a cat person, Pepper was it through and through. Husky Yasha saw her 'no, down boy' and raised her a giant pile of 'make me, princess', slobbering her from collarbone to eyeball.

Pepper was not impressed.

Don't get him wrong and he's said it a hundred times--Tony loved every polished, perfect, pretty part of Pepper Potts (hey, say that three times, fast), but disheveled, steely-eyed Pepper was the most fun of all the Peppers. (Tony saw an endless supply of tasty treats in Yasha's Christmas future.)

""What doeth Yatha mean?"" Bucky asked Natasha as they approached the stairs to the back porch.

""It's the Russian way of calling him 'James',"" Nat explained, guiding Bucky up the stairs as he lifted his puppy's front paws up each step, then gave a little shove to his butt to help him clear each tread and rise.

""You named ya new dog thame ath me?"" he asked, surprised.

She smiled. ""I did. He's got brown hair and blue eyes just like you, and he's very friendly and loves hugs just as much as you.""

Bucky hummed thoughtfully. ""He doeth thound a wot wike me. Thankth, Nat.""

""You're very welcome. Have you thought of a name for yours yet?"" she inquired, kneeling by his side to dust off the larger clumps of snow clinging to his pant legs and rear end.

Bucky did the same, smushing the biggest clumps of snow in his puppy's fur to knock them off. ""Nuh uh, not yet. Thoon, though. Um... I think he migh' need ta warm up. Thethe thnowballth ar' thtuck in hith fur weal bad.""

Pausing inside the door, Bucky stomped his feet like Darcy, following Tony's example under Rosa's flinty stare. ""I'll get blankets and have cocoa sent up. Boots, coats, and ski pants by the door. I'll have one of the girls bring down a quilt for the dogs, but you'll have to warm them up and keep them out of the fire. There's no proper child guard down here,"" the housekeeper reminded everyone.

Not that it turned out to be much of a problem. Rousing from sleep, Lucky the one-eyed Pizza Dog rounded up the canine (and honorary canine) arrivals, deftly herding them toward his own blanket near the hearth and intimidating the St. Bernard pup into a puddle of submission as he cleared its fur of snowballs.

""There 'a go. Lucky'zzz go' i'."" And then slurring Clint was unconscious on the floor again, puppies crowding in, around, and on him, huddling for warmth.

""I think I'mma caw mine Thteebie,"" Bucky lisped through chattering teeth and chapped lips as the puppy crawled into his lap and nipped at his chin.

Steve immediately protested, ""Aw, pal. You ought'a name him--""

""Nat named hew new dog afta' me,"" Bucky reminded Steve.

Well, then.

Tony laughed at the resigned look on Steve's face.

""Dat's a good idea,"" Darcy chimed in. ""Dey can all be Howling Commandogs, like mine.""

The engineer laughed, shaking his head. Howling Commandogs. His girl. ""You decided on a name for the little guy already?"" he asked, tugging off both boots as Darcy lay flat on the wet floor to help the process along faster.

""Da shaggy browned one wif blue eyes looks like Bucky. I'm gonna call him Barky Barnes,"" she said, shaking loose of the ski pants and crawling over to join the puppies in their pile on Clint.

With soft eyes full of tender, squishy feelings, Pepper approached Tony. ""We should talk about this. Six or seven dogs, or whatever this is, it's too many.""

""They're a family, Pep. I couldn't break them up."" Tony crossed his arms.

She crossed her arms, too. ""Tony, no.""

Tony pointed at the happy pile of puppies and kids climbing all over Barton. ""Pepper, yes.""

Darcy struggled to her knees with an armful of squirming wiener dog puppies and begged, ""Pepper, please?"" She really brought it home, though, with the lip wobble.

Together, Darcy and Tony turned sad puppy eyes on Pepper.

With a reluctant sigh, Pepper nodded, but added two caveats, ""Fine, but you're building another robot to clean up after them and they're not sleeping in our bed.""

""Yay!"" Darcy cheered, bouncing on Barton's belly. He grunted and rolled the other way, shaking Darcy off into the squirming pack. ""Dis one--"" She held up the labradoodle. ""--is Barky Barnes. And dis one--"" She held up the darker of the two brown dachshunds. ""Is Jim Furita. Dat one is Gabe Bones and da spotted one like him is Bark Dernier."" She pointed to the dappled dachshunds, then patted the butt of the fourth and declared, ""And dis one is Monty Falswoof.""

""What about the pig?"" Pepper asked, snickering behind her hand.

""Dum Dum Piggin',"" Darcy decided on the spot, patting it gently and oinking back when it snorted for more attention.

Suddenly invested in the conversation, Natasha spoke up as she lavished Yasha with belly rubs. ""The pig is litter trained."" 

Pepper looked slightly less put out at that news.

""And this one's name?"" Steve held up Mother Pug for Darcy, then under his breath, ""Did anyone else notice this dog's only got one eye?""

But Darcy couldn't be bothered about the dog's missing eye. Names had to be decided here, Thteeb. She tapped her lips and pointed at the pug. ""Dat's Puggy Carter. She's the Head Commandog in Charge.""

Smiling from ear to ear, Tony just had to know, ""So what's the verdict on yours, Bucky? He got a name?""

""Thteeb Pawgerth."" He nodded once, decided and done.


 Steve Pawgers. 


Perfect. Pleased with the outcome of the day's big surprise, Tony clapped and reminded everyone, ""Excellent! We should start to get cleaned up for dinner. Tomorrow's a big day! Puppies to cuddle, clubhouse to renovate, camp to explore!""

At the prospect of a warm bath, the kids raced up the stairs, puppies in hot pursuit.

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

Later that night, surrounded by puppies, one teacup pig, and a bunny she was fairly certain did not belong in the Stark menagerie, Pepper's eyes met Tony's over Darcy's head on the pillows.

""It's only for tonight,"" he swore, rubbing a tiny dachshund's back to lull it to sleep. ""Jarvis is already looking for a big bean bag thing to put in the playroom for the Howling Commandogs. One night, promise.""

When she laughed and shook her head, he leaned over, lips puckered for a good night kiss.

Instead, he got a mouthful of pig snout when someone popped out the top of the pile in between. Pepper laughed so hard behind her hand, she snorted. The pig gave a tiny snort in return and nuzzled closer to Pepper.

In the morning, Darcy woke up in bed, surrounded by puppies (and her honorary puppy), but no Daddy and no Pepper. A sound like soft music floated into the room and the puppies stirred, shifting and sighing and snuggling deeper into the thick blanket Pepper called doo-VAY. Darcy loved doo-VAY. It felt like sleeping on a cloud or a marshmallow. Perfect for kids and puppies, and Daddy, who liked marshmallows, especially in his cocoa and in his mouth.

That reminded her--she pulled her dog-eared Howtoons book out from under the pillows to review the plans for marshmallow shooters she and Bucky wanted to build. She added a note to a piece of paper Bucky shoved in the book to mark their page: ""make 1 big marshmello shooter for big marshmelloz for daddee or 2 big marshmello shootrz so captin steev can play to"".

Dum Dum Piggin' rolled over and nosed under Darcy's elbow,  oink-oink-oinking  for attention, so Darcy gave his belly a scritch-scritch and dug under the pillows again with her other hand to find the special phone Daddy gave her to use when she wanted to talk quietly to Jarvis. The battery was low, but it was enough.

""Jarvish,"" she typed.

""Good morning, Miss Stark,"" came the immediate reply on the small screen.

""Good morning, Jarvish,"" she copied his polite greeting. ""Where can I get PVC piep for marshmello shootrz""

""PVC pipe can be ordered from the hardware store and picked up by a designated person later this morning. What diameter and how many feet of pipe do you require?""

Hmm... Darcy didn't know. They wanted to make mini marshmallow shooters for the whole family for Christmas.

""In my book,"" she typed, then realized she could point the camera in the phone at the book to show the list of materials while she scratched her baby pig's belly. She scanned the pages for Jarvis to see.

""How many of these PVC air shooters would you like to build?"" he asked.

""1 for everbodee in r famlee, and 2 big 1s for daddee and captin steev"" She could read better than she could spell, but Jarvis was very good at understanding even when she didn't know how to spell all the words except for how they sounded out of her mouth when she said them out loud.

""Sir says he plans to make a trip to the hardware store early today and you are listed as an approved account user for the Stark line of credit at all three local hardware stores. You may order whatever you need. Will there be anything else, Miss Stark?""

""Minee and big marshmelloz, lots ov them, at leats 20 powndz""

""Very well. I have added them to the household grocery list. I will notify you when the materials arrive.""

""Thak you Jarvish""

""You are welcome, Miss Stark.""

Pleased with the success of her first order of business, Darcy gave the piggy one more good hard scritch, then picked it up and climbed carefully out of bed to avoid waking the other puppies. With just as much care, she pulled up the bottom of her T-shirt to make a pocket to carry her piggy-puppy and padded to the bathroom to peek inside to see what was making the music sound.

Pepper sat at the counter, singing under her breath and rubbing nice-smelling things on her face. When she saw Darcy in the mirror, she smiled. ""Good morning, sweetie. What do you have there?"" she asked.

""My piggy-puppy. I gotta go potty, but my piggy-puppy would have woke up the puppies in bed, so I brought it.""

""Here--"" Pepper held her hands out for Dum Dum Piggin' and Darcy passed him over. ""I'll hold him while you use the potty. Do you need any help?""

Darcy smiled and shook her head. ""No, I can do it myself."" And she did. The big bathroom had a tiny room with its own door and the toilet was inside it. The toilet was very tall, though, so her Daddy got another stool like the one she sat on in the bathtub, but the new one sat in front of the very big toilet. The stool was her favorite color. Teal. So pretty.

She washed her hands when she was done and watched Pepper smear more things on her face.

""What do those do?"" she asked, climbing up on the bench next to Pepper to touch the pretty bottles.

""Most of them help my skin stay soft. This one--"" She pointed to a tiny pot of cream, then opened it for Darcy to sniff. Mm. Oranges. ""--is just for the skin around my eyes. And this one--"" She picked up a larger pot. ""--is special. I don't use it every day, just once or twice a week because it feels nice during the winter. This one helps me feel awake on days when I don't want to get out from under the warm covers."" She held up a reddish-orange tube with a pump top.

""I like to stay in bed when Daddy stays in bed late,"" Darcy agreed. ""He's warm and huggy.""

Pepper laughed and hugged Darcy. ""Yes, he is. That's why it's hard to get up sometimes!""

""Can I put on some, too?"" Darcy asked, touching the tiny orange-scented container.

""Yes, but maybe not that one. Your eyes might not like that. I have one here that you can put on your hands and your face. Your skin will drink it all up just like when you drink water.""

Darcy liked the sound of that a lot. ""Yes, please."" She sat up tall and stuck her chin out for face water. It smelled different than the other one. Like honey and flowers. When Pepper was done, Darcy opened her eyes and looked in the mirror. Her skin sparkled as she turned, like the lotion had gold glitter in it. Nice! ""It looks like a unicorm kissed my whole face!"" she gasped, standing to lean in with her hands on the mirror and look at herself close up.

""Now your skin won't be thirsty!"" Pepper promised as she recapped the container.

Watching her hands move, the ring on Pepper's finger that looked like a pink ice cube caught Darcy's attention. Tentatively, she sat down and touched the pink cube, wiggling it in her fingers to catch the light like the sparkling gold glitters on her face.

""When you marry my daddy, will you be my mommy?"" she wondered out loud.

Pepper got very still, like when Darcy and Bucky played the statue game with Hulk back home. For a little while, she didn't say anything.

Eventually, Pepper took a big, deep breath, like Daddy did sometimes after he had a bad moment that made his heart beat real fast. Then Pepper said, ""Your daddy and I plan to get married, but there's been no rush. Is it important to you? Having a mommy and daddy who are married?""

Darcy shook her head 'no'. ""Not to me, but Daddy maybe. When he holds your hand, he touches your pretty ring and sometimes he looks at it like Bucky looks at cookies when Captain Steve tells him to be patient and he can have some soon, but 'soon' isn't soon enough,"" she explained, but she wasn't sure if that was absolutely right or only close-to-right. She tilted her head sideways like her daddy did sometimes when he was thinking about a big problem. ""Are you Daddy's cookies?""

The top of Pepper's lips folded over into her mouth like she was biting it and her shoulders shook. She was maybe laughing, but that was okay. Sometimes, Pepper laughed just because she was happy or because she loved Daddy, but didn't want to encourage him when he did a crazy-fun thing.

Like when Darcy and Bucky showed him their plans for a Hulk swing set with a fort and real lasers on top and when they put dynamite on their material list for building the swing set in the common room and Daddy looked at it with his very serious face and said 'ok', but Pepper said, ""Tony, no.""

Pepper said ""Tony, no"" a LOT.

""If your daddy and I get married before you're grownup again..."" Pepper started, then stopped, then started again, ""do you think you'd you like to be in the wedding?""

Oh. Oh, oh, oh... YES. ""YES."" Darcy nodded, then thought for a minute. ""Would I have to wear a dress?"" That was a deal breaker.

""Not if you don't want to. We could both wear pretty suits, instead.""

""Will Daddy wear the dress?"" Daddy would probably wear a dress if Pepper asked.

Pepper chuckled and shook her head. ""No, he would wear a very nice tuxedo.""

""Could Bucky be in the wedding?""

""I don't see why not."" Pepper smiled and her whole face smiled, too, eyes and everything.

""YAY!"" Darcy bounced, but she forgot she was sitting on the tiny bench and fell off backwards, end over end like Humpty Dumpty. Dum Dum Piggin' tumbled to the floor, too, as Pepper scrambled to catch Darcy and missed them both.

Ow. ""Ow."" Darcy tried to rub her head and poked herself in the eye. That hurt. Everything looked kind of blurry when she opened her eyes and looked up at Pepper's very close face. A drop of water landed on Darcy's cheek.

""Darcy, Darcy, are you okay?"" Pepper's voice sounded funny and too far away for her face. ""Jarvis, hurry. Page Dr. Lin. Ask him to come to my room right away. Darcy hit her head and she's not answering me. Her pupils are dilated even though she's staring at the light fixture. And get Tony if he hasn't left for town yet.""

The sound of Dum-E whirring and whirring and whirring nervously outside the door made Darcy's teeth itch.

Daddy ran into the bathroom, first. ""Darcy!"" He knelt on the floor in his gym shorts and T-shirt.

""Don't move her!"" Pepper's voice sounded tiny,  tinny, tinny, tinny,  like bells.

Darcy closed her eyes, but her daddy's voice stayed close, saying she was safe and it would be okay and to try to stay still, if she could, and it was okay to cry, if she needed to, and to please cry just a little, anything, so I know you're okay. Something soft and warm touched her wet cheek and her piggy  oink-oink-oinked  as big hands tipped her sideways and slid her onto something hard.

She slept for a while, maybe, and dreamed about when she was a grownup. Lunch in the science lab and a pair of Cherry Cokes in old fashioned glass bottles that made her smile, and a kiss that made her belly feel funny because the face she kissed was grownup with fuzzy cheeks, but the eyes were Bucky's.

When she opened her eyes again, she was in a different room with pastel colored cartoons on the wall. ""Wha' happen'?"" she tried to ask, but it came out all garbled and wrong like when Mr. Hawkeye drank lots of beers on Pizza Fridays and talked in his sleep with his head on his dog during the movie after dinner.

""You ask that every time you wake up,"" Daddy said softly. She felt the rough calluses on his fingers against her palm.

""Sorry,"" she tried to apologize, but only the 's' came out right.

""It's okay, just a bump and a mild concussion. Bucky's done worse just riding his bike into a wall at home. You'll be okay, sweetie,"" Pepper's soft voice came from the same side of the bed and a cool hand stroked the damp hair away from Darcy's face.

""Mommy."" Darcy's feelings got real big and crashed into the same place in the middle of her chest all at once and she cried again.  ""Mommy!"" 

""Right here,"" Mommy Pepper's voice crooned and the fingers pushed gently through Darcy's hair, smoothing over her temple with a touch like an angel's wing feathers.

""Mommy,"" she managed one more time before sliding back into the dark, right on the edge of the dark, dark, dark.

""We'll be right here, kiddo,"" Daddy promised, kissing her forehead in between words. ""Just rest. You're safe. We'll be right here.""

Darcy closed her eyes and slept.

The next few days were a haze of that same fuzzy feeling, waking up to different people telling her it was okay, but most often her daddy and mommy. After the first day, someone must have moved her because she woke up at home at the lodge in her daddy's big bed with puppies and her Bucky Bear, and all of them were covered up with Mr. Thor's cape. She loved this room in this house. It looked like a log cabin from a picture book. There was a fireplace and a big, rusty metal chandelier over the bed and furniture that looked like it was made by a person who built barns. The bed had a big, green patchwork quilt and there were fake fur rugs on the floor on both sides of the bed so you could climb down and put your slippers on before you had to step on any cold floors. It was extra cozy.

Noises like Christmas carols drifted down the hall from outside the bedroom door, but Mr. Falcon Sam sat in the reading chair by the bed. His book was very thick, probably about important grownup superhero things.

""Goo' morning,"" she whispered, rubbing the silky inside trim around the neck part of the cape. She didn't know Mr. Falcon Sam so good. He had a lot of names like Senior Air Man and Agent Wilson and Falcon and Sam Wilson and she didn't always know what to call him, so mostly she didn't. He wasn't like her daddy and Captain Steve and Uncle Colonel Rhodey. He was more quiet, a very serious adult who never had to wrestle Bucky into the tub or bribe Darcy to put on her swimsuit or tell Daddy he had a bad idea. Mr. Falcon Sam read a lot and talked about feelings and joked with Mr. Hawkeye and Captain Steve, but he didn't say many things to Darcy, so she didn't say any things back unless she had to be polite. 'Good morning' was polite.

""Hey, angel."" Mr Falcon Sam smiled and set his book aside. ""How are you feeling?""

""Everything feels wobbly in my head,"" she whispered, pulling her Bucky Bear up to hide behind.

Mr. Falcon Sam's face made a soft smile. ""That's not unusual after a concussion. It'll start to get better over the next few days, though.""

Oh, good. That was good to know.

""Where's my daddy?"" she asked, inching farther down the bed under Mr. Thor's cape until Barky Barnes yipped at her to quit it.

""Your daddy?"" Mr. Falcon Sam's eyebrows squished in the middle and his face looked confused. ""You mean Tony?""

Darcy nodded.

""He's been sitting in this chair around the clock since you came home from the emergency room. Pepper's been up here, too. Everyone finally ganged up on them and insisted they go stretch their legs about..."" He looked at his watch. ""...an hour ago now.""

""Pepper is going to be my mommy."" That was important, so she said so. The room spun in close and stretched out, making Darcy a little sick to her stomach.

""You don't say?"" He leaned forward and put his elbows on his knees. His sweatpants crinkled and blurred in Darcy's vision. She blinked hard, trying to remember what she was going to say.

""She's going to marry my daddy, and me and Bucky will be in the wedding with the 'bots. And maybe Jarvis."" Darcy thought about Pepper's ring. ""She has a ring that means getting married forever and she asked if I wanted to be in it, but no dresses."" Darcy blinked again, but her voice sounded funny, wobbly like her head. The dark got close and she felt sleepy.

The next time she woke up, all the puppies except Barky Barnes were gone from the room, but there was a big lump next to her under Mr. Thor's cape. She put her head under and looked. It was Bucky! He smiled his big smile without his front teeth and his big, fluffy puppy's head popped up over his shoulder and barked.

""Hi Darth,"" Bucky said. ""Ith ya head betta' now? Ya mithed lotth o' thtuff. Me and Thteebie and Nat and Mithter Hawkath and Tham wode in a twuck up da moun'in and got thome tweeth and bwought 'em back and they all gettin' decowated now becauthe Mith Peppa' doeth thingth when thee'th wowwied, like decowatin' and owganizin'. And Thteeb Pawgerth leawned how ta thit!""

Darcy blinked a lot. He said a lot of words and she could usually figure most of them out most of the time, but that last one...

""What did Steve Pawgers learn to do?"" she asked.

""Thit down!"" A thump came from the far side of the bed. Darcy and Bucky scrambled across the covers to look as the big, fuzzy puppy rolled on its back like a turtle before righting itself and planting its rear end squarely on the floor.

""Ohhh... He learned how to SIT."" That made more sense. ""Good job, Steve Pawgers."" Darcy held her hand out and the puppy put his paw in it.

""We' wo'kin' on thakin', too. It'th thtill hit or mith, though. Goo' job, Thteeb Pawgerth."" Bucky patted the fluffy puppy on the head. Steve Pawgers' tongue came out of his mouth and just hung there. ""Yatha!"" Bucky yelled, making Darcy's ears ring as the husky hopped around the end of the bed. A few seconds later, grownup boots appeared, too.

""Darcy, are you feeling up to coming downstairs?"" Miss Nat asked, putting her hand on Darcy's forehead for a second, then on both her cheeks before looking into her eyes. ""The Christmas tree is up in the great room and everyone is going to decorate it together while we play Christmas music. Miss Rosa made cookies and hot cocoa. Dr. Lin said you can come downstairs for a few hours, but only if you're not too tired.""

""My head still feels funny. I might fall again,"" Darcy answered sadly because she was very sad. Decorating the tree sounded fun.

""That's okay. I brought someone strong along to do the heavy lifting."" Captain Steve's head appeared around the edge of the doorway.

""Why isn't my daddy here?"" she worried when she saw Captain Steve.

""He's talking to the men who installed the new floor in the Rec Pavilion today because he wants to make sure it's ready soon."" Captain Steve knelt by the side of the bed and looked Darcy over very carefully, too. ""Your daddy forgot to take care of himself for a while because he was so worried about you, so Miss Rosa made pancakes and Miss Nat convinced him to go downstairs for food and some rest. He took a nap for a little while, but when he realized we were getting ready to decorate the big tree, he decided to make plans to make this Christmas very special for you. He'll be so happy to see you up and out of bed,"" Captain Steve promised as he gathered up her Bucky Bear and Mr. Thor's cape and piled Darcy and Barky Barnes inside it for the walk down the really big stairs. His shirt smelled nice, a little bit like Daddy's cologne and something sweet, like flowers or Miss Nat's perfume.

""Darcy!"" Mommy's voice called out as Captain Steve carried Darcy down the stairs. The sound of fancy shoes click-clicked across the floor very fast. Then there was light orangey-gold hair and the flower scent of Pepper as Captain Steve helped Darcy switch to her mommy's arms. ""I'm so happy to see you awake. I kept missing you. You woke up every time I took a shower or ran downstairs for coffee,"" Mommy whispered, swaying gently, but not so much that Darcy got sick.

""I'm sorry,"" Darcy answered, hugging her arms around Mommy's neck under her hair. ""Love you, Mommy.""

""I love you, too, but you have nothing to be sorry for, sweetie. The very first thing your daddy did was cover the bathroom floor in thick padding and rugs. Then he had Mr. Tom build us a nice, long bench with a high back so we can sit together at the counter, so this will never happen again.""

""I didn't mean to fall. I was just excited.""

""I know, honey. We won't worry about it again, okay?"" Mommy pushed the hair behind her ear and kissed her head. ""Are you hungry? Bucky baked cookies and gingerbread with Miss Rosa today. You can have some with cocoa, if you like.""

""Yes, please."" Mommy set her down on the big couch in the middle corner spot with her Bucky Bear and Mr's Thor's cape, and Miss Rosa brought her a thermos of cocoa with a sippy straw. Mommy put two cookies and a gingerbread man on a small plate and sat down right next to Darcy to cuddle under the cape. Mmm. Snuggly. The cocoa was so warm and milky. It made her a little sleepy again. She ate the gingerbread man, but gave Bucky her cookies when he made the cookie face at her plate. Cookies were Bucky's kryptonite.

Later, she woke up again to the sound of her name being whispered by Mr. Hawkeye. ""Darcy. Hey, Darcy, did you order twenty pounds of mini marshmallows?""

""No."" He eyed her for a minute before she blinked all the way awake and added, ""Jarvis did.""

Why did everyone laugh?

The tree was half-decorated when her daddy walked into the room, carrying a box with a pile of plaid blankets on top. ""Daddy!"" she tried to call to him, but her voice was still whispery from her wobbly head.

He heard her, though, because he turned and his face smiled the very big smile and he said, ""Darcy,"" like he had a big breath in his mouth before he said it. Then he hurried across the room and put his hand on the back of the couch and hopped over it and he hugged her SO HARD. Best hug ever. ""It's so nice to see you awake,"" he said real quiet under her hair by her ear.

""My head doesn't feel so wobbly now,"" she said, hoping to make him feel better.

""I'm glad to hear that. You had me worried when you kept falling asleep,"" he said, giving her one more squeeze.

""I'm sorry I scared you."" She leaned against his chest and took a deep breath. He smelled like cologne and oil and that black stuff from the bots that he smeared on everything. Daddy smelled like home.

A few days before Christmas, Bucky woke to an odd, new sensation. At first, he couldn't quite put his finger on it. He shifted uncomfortably under the covers, nudging Steve Pawgers and his fluffle of bunnies this way and that, trying to find a more comfortable position, but something just didn't feel right. Bucky sat up, pulling the quilt up to his chin and blinking into the semi-dark room. The soft glow of his Captain America night light shined through the dark, casting distorted shadows up the bumpy log cabin walls. Everything in the room looked like it should, but something deep down felt wrong. His belly felt funny and something--under the blankets--he lifted them and looked.

Oh.

That was new.

It didn't do that yesterday. Tentative, Bucky poked it. It poked back with a springy motion. Ok, it definitely didn't do  that  yesterday.

""Mithter Jarvith?"" Bucky asked, trying to keep his voice from shaking, but he was worried and kind of scared.

""Yes, Master Barnes?""

""Coul' ya ... coul' ya get Thteebie. Teww him ... uh ... ta huwwy. Pweathe?"" It was still early enough to be dark outside the windows. Stevie was probably down in the gym alone, running on the special treadmill Mr. Stark built for him that said sassy things at him every time he beat Mr. Wilson's time.

""Your respiration and heart rate are elevated,"" Jarvis answered. ""Are you in distress?""

Bucky licked his lips and buried his fingers in Steve Pawgers' fur, grabbing at the quilt and piling more of it on top of the problem. Distress. Distress meant upset or worried. Yes, he felt both of those. ""Um, yeth. Yeth, that. Jutht teww 'im ta huwwy, pweathe."" Bucky ducked under the covers and yanked them way up over his head and Steve Pawgers.


 Thump, thump, thump, thump. 


Feet banged up the stairs and down the hall before the bedroom door crashed open and Stevie and Nat's voices jumped all over each other, asking what was wrong.

""Buck?"" Stevie's voice got closer to the bed.

""Ya a'thppothed ta be awone, Thteebie,"" Bucky grumped into the covers. Why'd he have to bring Nat? So embarrassin'.

""Jarvis said you were distressed. We thought you had a nightmare,"" Stevie said when Bucky poked his face out of the covers to glare at his best pal, surrounded by a bunch of adults with nothin' better to do.

""I athked 'im to teww you ta huwwy, not ta get ever'boby."" Bucky's lip wobbled. He didn't really wanna talk about the new thing at all, much less with everybody they knew in the  whole house.  Gosh Stevie. He pulled the covers up again.

Stevie's voice got real quiet and far away, but Bucky heard him ask the others to wait outside in the hall for a minute. Then there were footsteps and somebody tugged at the corner of the covers. Bucky reached out and slapped at the hand, tugging the corner in and tucking it under his arm.

""Buck?"" Stevie waited. ""Come on, pal. If something's wrong, I can't help fix it if you won't talk to me.""

""Ar' ya awone?"" Bucky checked to be sure.

""Yes, I told everyone you wanted to talk to me alone. Nat is across the hall in case we need her and the other fellas are down the hall in the den. Mr. Stark said you can ask Jarvis anything you want, too, and he'll keep your privacy, if you need it.""

Bucky huffed into the quilt. Jarvis misunderstood things sometimes, like when he got everybody instead of just Stevie. Bucky said so and waited.

""Jarvis is an A.I. Sometimes, you have to say a very specific thing so he understands exactly what you're asking him to do. He knew you were breathing hard and your heart was beating very fast and that you were acting different than the way you usually act. He did exactly the right thing under those circumstances. He let me know something was wrong and you needed help.""

Oh. Well... Bucky supposed that made a lot of sense. He shifted onto his back, but that was worse than laying on his side. He rolled to his side again, but that caused an uncomfortable pain from the new thing. All of it was terrible. He groaned and wriggled, trying to find a better spot, but the new thing sprang up and he got tangled in the covers. Man oh man, he sure wished he could use some of Agent Barton's swear words right now.

""Buck, you sound like you're in pain. You gonna tell me what it is or am I getting Dr. Lin to check you out?""

""No!"" Bucky threw the covers down to his waist and sat up. ""No doctuhth, Thteebie. He alwayth wantth to thtick me with a new vaccthine. It'th awful. Rathu' jutht get the mawawia an' be done with it.""

""Well, then, no malaria vaccines for you."" Stevie knelt by the bed and crossed his arms on top of the mattress across from Bucky. ""Tell me what's goin' on.""

Bucky hunched over, willing away the new thing one last time before he had to go through with it, but nothing happened. He pushed back the covers so Stevie could see and pointed to the new thing.

""I don' know why it'th doin' that. It neber did it befo',"" Bucky explained, more miserable than ever. ""If I mobe wong, it bumpth inta thtuff and eben layin' unda' the bwanket feelth wong.""

""I see."" Stevie covered his mouth like he was thinkin' of all the ways to deliver the bad news.

Bucky sniffled and two big tears stung his eyes. ""It'th bad, ithn't it?""

""No, pal."" Stevie shook his head and crossed his arms again. ""I think it's a normal thing that happens to most boys. It's called an erection.""

""It'th tewwiboo,"" Bucky decided.

Stevie agreed, ""They can be uncomfortable.""

""Thith happenth ta you, too?""

""Only since I got real big in the army. Remember how I was always sick when I was little?""

""Yeah.""

""One of my illnesses prevented this from happening to me when I was your age, so it's normal and healthy that it's happening to you.""

""Ar' ya thure?"" Bucky leaned in to look Stevie in the eye.

""Pretty sure. There's some fellas down the hall probably know more about what's normal. None a' them grew up sick like me. We could ask 'em, if you don't mind. I trust them to tell the truth and keep what we say in confidence, pal.""

Bucky thought about that for a minute, then nodded, twisting his fingers in the folds of the quilt.

""Jarvis,"" Stevie raised his voice. ""Could you  discreetly  contact the fellas in the den and ask them if they ever had the same problem Bucky is having right now, and if they have, could they please let us know?""

Why would a fella ever admit to that?

Not even thirty seconds later, Stevie's phone pinged with four 'yes' answers. He held it up to show Bucky. Then, a knock sounded at the door.

""Okay if I let the fellas in? There's a good chance they've got more experience with this than me and can answer your questions better.""

Swallowing the nervous lump in his throat, Bucky nodded. Mr. Stark, Mr. Wilson, Colonel Rhodes, and Agent Barton all stood on the other side of the door. Stevie invited them in and explained the spetific nature of Bucky's problem.

Bucky had to know one thing first. ""It'th not pewmanent, ith it?""

""No."" Mr Stark shook his head and leaned against the wall by the closed door. ""But sometimes it'll seem like it is. In a few years, especially. It happens to almost every boy, though. Boys who are sick like Steve was when he was little would be the exception. It's normal and healthy, even though it's annoying.""

That wasn't very reassuring. Bucky set the covers back and poked it again, but it came right back like a spring.

""First things first, pal,"" Stevie said, catching Bucky's hand before he could flick it again. ""Quit pokin' it. That'll only make it worse, if it's uncomfortable.""

""Oh."" Bucky stuck his hands behind his back and stared at it. Erection. Sounded like you were buildin' somethin' with it.

Mr. Wilson sat down, cross-legged, on the play rug in the middle of the floor. ""It probably hurts a little bit, too, huh?""

Bucky nodded and another tear leaked out of his eye. ""When I mobe too muthch.""

""Well."" Agent Barton sat down on the rug, too. (Today, his T-shirt said 'Eat Pizza - Sports Are Hard"".) ""Steve's right. Too much stimulation--touching it more--will only make the problem worse.""

""How do I keep it fwom happenin'? I don' wike it."" Bucky growled and crossed his arms, and tried really hard not to make any more embarrassin' tears.

""You mean 'why does it happen?' "" Colonel Rhodes asked, sitting in the reading chair in the corner. He leaned forward and clasped his hands between his knees.

Bucky nodded.

""Lots of things could cause it,"" Agent Barton said, holding up a hand and ticking off reasons. ""A certain scent, a nice daydream, a dream in your sleep, if you haven't pooped in a while, thinking a lot about something you like--""

""--or for no reason at all,"" Mr. Stark interrupted. ""Sometimes a stiff wind blows in just the right direction and it happens and you just have to sit somewhere quiet with your bookbag in your lap to keep it from moving too much and wait for it to decide to go away.""

""Grownups sometimes take cold showers, when it's convenient,"" Colonel Rhodes added, ""but I wouldn't recommend that as a first resort to make it go away. Cold showers are awful.""

""Experts in child-rearing recommend young boys sit in a tepid bath to relax,"" Jarvis suggested, ""or attempt to distract oneself with a hobby like reading or thinking about something unrelated.""

""Wike what?"" Bucky asked, looking up at the ceiling, but Jarvis didn't answer. The other fellas did.

Right away, Stevie said, ""Baseball.""

""Engine schematics,"" Mr. Stark and Colonel Rhodes said at the same time.

""Scrubbing a latrine,"" Mr. Wilson said at the same time Agent Barton said, ""Getting my ass handed to me by Agent Hill in the gym.""

Bucky wrinkled his nose at Mr. Wilson and Agent Barton, but they defended their suggestions the same way. They said sometimes thinking about something you  don't  like will make it go away if something you like made it happen in the first place.

""Think about things that make you sad or angry. Can you think of one?"" Mr. Stark asked.

Bucky nodded. ""Yeah. I di'n't wike it when Darthy wath in da hothpital.""

Looking real sad, Stevie told Bucky to try thinkin' about that and see if it helped. If not, they'd try the lukewarm bath.

Bucky tried, he did, but the erection didn't go anywhere. It was stuck. He really hoped it wasn't permanent.

""Maybe it'th bwoken,"" Bucky said sadly at it with a big frown.

""Come on, pal. Let's try the bath. We'll get a book and I'll read to you while you sit in the water,"" Stevie said, helping Bucky out of bed.

""Ow."" Bucky had to stop right next to the bed. He couldn't even walk. He made a sad face at Stevie, so his pal picked him up.

""Do me a favor?"" Stevie asked Mr. Wilson. ""Grab him a change of clothes. I'm gonna take him over to use Nat's tub. There's a chair in our bathroom. We might be a while.""

Stevie was right. It took a while. Nat put lots of flower-scented stuff in the tub. 'Lavender Oil' Bucky thought the bottle said on the edge of the sink. On the upside, they got to read all of chapter ten of the third Harry Potter book and Mr. Wilson picked out soft, comfortable clothes for Bucky to wear after his bath: flannel PJ bottoms, his Black Widow unders, and a T-shirt Colonel Rhodes bought for Bucky that said ""Not All Superheroes Wear Capes"" and had a bunch of soldiers on it, saluting. Bucky liked it because he knew lots of superheroes who didn't wear capes, and some who had uniforms and saluted. Neat.

""Thteebie?"" Bucky sat in the tub, thinking about something else that bothered him for a while.

""Yeah?"" Stevie looked like he was getting drowsy sitting by the tub, too.

""Why do boyth get erecthionth? What'th it fo'?"" Bucky checked out his again. It looked much better. No more springing. He relaxed even more, laying back on Nat's bathtub pillow and waiting for Stevie to answer.

His pal cleared his throat and his face got real red, but he wiggled his lips like he was trying to find the right words. ""Erections help grownups ... ahh ... make love and babies."" He nodded once like those were just the right words.

But Bucky wasn't buying it. He squinted at Stevie. ""You get erecthionth.""

""Yes,"" Stevie agreed.

Bucky thought about that for a minute.

""You wewn't reawwy wrethlin' with Nat that day, wewe you?"" Bucky suddenly realized.

Stevie choked and sputtered. ""Nat and I-- We aren't--""

""You thould mawwy hew befo' you make babieth with ya erecthion, Thteebie. Thee detherveth ta be tweated wike a wady."" Bucky splashed a little cool water in Stevie's direction. ""Or ya coul' take more col' thowerth, inthtead."" He grinned.

SMOL!BUCKY BARNES SLEEPING IN A PILE OF FLUFFY BUNNIES.

What else do you even need to know?

Chapter beta'd and PR'd by chimyra.

Prompt provided by georgiagirlagain (and I sincerely hope she does not mind that I got inspired to use it for today's chapter, instead of a bonus scene, but it was too good to pass up!) This chapter is also for all the sadists who requested smol!Bucky had to catch up on his vaccines and shots, you meanies. :P

One-word prompt: nightmares

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

The next morning didn't start off much better for Bucky. He was just mindin' his own business, sleepin', when a scary dream came about cold and dark, and... and... pain. Someone was in a lot of pain. He woke up with tears on his cheeks and his heart beatin' real fast.

""Mithter Jarvith,"" he sniffled into the covers. ""Ya thewe?""

""I am,"" Mr. Jarvis' voice answered quietly. ""How may I assist you?""

""I hab a ba' dweam,"" Bucky hiccuped, pressing his face into the pillow.

""Captain Rogers and Agent Romanova received a late call for an overnight mission with Senior Airman Wilson and Agent Barton. They will return in a few hours' time. If you would like, I can provide you with cartoons to watch or read you a story, or..."" He paused. ""Per protocol, I have notified Sir of your distress in the absence of the captain and Agent Romanova. Sir says he will come to you, if you like, or you may go to his bedroom to join the slumber party in progress.""

That was a lot of things to have to decide when Bucky felt like his insides were still on the outside. ""I don' know,"" he cried harder.

A few seconds later, the door clicked open and Mr. Stark called from the doorway, ""It's just me, kid."" Then, a little bit closer. ""Bad dream, huh?"" He sat on the edge of the bed and brushed Bucky's hair back, dabbing at his tears. ""Don't wanna be alone?"" he asked like he understood.

Bucky shook his head, but his breath hitched again and more crying came out anyways.

""Sh... It's okay. You're okay now."" Mr. Stark picked him up and propped him on his hip, hugging him close with a hand on the back of his head. ""Come on. Plenty of company in my room for someone who doesn't want to be alone."" He click-clicked for Steve Pawgers to follow as he grabbed Bucky's soft blanket, and the puppy and Yasha (who decided to sleep in Bucky's room last night), and all the bunnies tumbled out of the bed, too. ""I wondered where they got to,"" Mr. Stark said, clicking some more for the animals to follow. Bucky watched Steve Pawgers and Yasha scamper down the hall after them, the bunnies hippety-hop-hopping along behind.

When Bucky sniffled again, Mr. Stark stopped in the doorway, turned, and grabbed something from a box on the table by the door. He offered it to Bucky.


 A hanky! 


Boy, nothing felt right like a hanky for wipin' your nose. ""Thankth, Mithter Thtark.""

""You're welcome,"" he whispered as they entered the dark bedroom. ""I remembered you saying something about missing hankies back in the city, so I packed some in my suitcase, but we'll get Jarvis to take care of it so you have some of your own, too.""

""Thankth."" Suddenly, Bucky felt very shy. Mr. Stark sure was swell. He carried Bucky all the way over to the bed and tucked him in beside Darcy before stooping down and sliding something--ooh, stairs!--over by the bed for Steve Pawgers and Yasha and the bunnies to climb up, too. They settled in the open space at the end of the bed and it was a very full bed with Darcy's Barky Barnes and Miss Pepper's Dum Dum Piggin' and Puggy Carter (who usually slept next to Yasha in Stevie and Nat's room) and all the wiener puppies piled up on Darcy. Good thing Mr. Stark had a very big bed.

Mr. Stark climbed in next and tugged on the covers until all the animals resettled. He pulled the quilt right up and tucked it under his armpit and the edge under Bucky's chin. Then he kissed Bucky on the head and said, ""Wake me up if the bad dreams come back, okay? No need to feel sad alone, kid.""

Bucky laid awake for a little while listening to Darcy breathe and feeling the nice warm feeling of Mr. Stark with his arm thrown over Bucky and Darcy both at the same time. Barky Barnes wiggled up the bed between them and nibbled on Bucky's fingers for a while until Steve Pawgers got jealous and wiggled up, too. Then Miss Pepper's hand tapped each puppy on the nose and said a quiet, ""no"", and the puppies settled down and Bucky got sleepy and warm ... and sleepy...

And then they slept.

Hours later, quiet voices whispered, pulling Bucky from nice dreams about laying in a pile with his bunnies. Then he woke up and he was laying in a pile with his bunnies and Steve Pawgers and Barky Barnes and Darcy and Mr. Stark. Miss Pepper's side of the bed dipped down and fabric rustled.

Miss Pepper's voice got a little louder. ""Jarvis pinged Tony's phone last night. Bucky was upset after a nightmare and he became more upset when Jarvis offered assistance, so Tony brought him--all of  them --back here. He went right back to sleep.""

""I'm sorry, Pepper--""

""Don't you apologize or thank me. You'd do the same for Darcy.""

""We're trying to work it out so we don't get called out together so often--""

""It's really no problem. He was out like a light.""

""Thanks, Pepper.""

""What did I say about thanking me?""

""Do you want me to...?""

""Let them sleep. He's been muttering off and on about bunnies the past hour or so. He's okay now.""

Surrounded by bunny fluff and the heavy sound of Steve Pawgers' breath, Bucky dozed off again.

""We overslept,"" a deep voice said later. Something like sandpaper scratch-rubbed. ""Hey, kid, Rosa's making chocolate waffles. If we don't get up soon, she'll pull the plug on the waffle iron and we'll miss out.""

Bucky sat straight up. ""Thocholate waffleth?"" He blinked the sleepiness from his brain and tried to focus on Mr. Stark. ""I lub thocolate waffleth. Ith thewe ithe cweam?""

""I don't see why not. My house; my rules. Let's go get waffles and ice cream."" Mr. Stark's eyebrows were pushed all the way up his head. He looked sleepy, too. His hair was a  mess. 

""Thankth, Mithter Thtark, fo' eber'fing."" Bucky said, scooting to the edge of the bed and the top of the little staircase the puppies used.

""Ah."" Mr. Stark waved a hand. ""Don't mention it. Everybody has rough nights. And you can call me Tony, you know.""

""Okay, Tony."" Bucky grinned, sliding down the little stairs on his rear end. ""I'm a'thppothed to bruth my teef and ge' dwethed befo' bweakfatht, though.""

""Exceptions can be made in emergencies, like missing breakfast from oversleeping. I'll take the blame. Come on,"" Tony said, grabbing Bucky's hand and hustling him down the stairs to the dining room.

They ate waffles and ice cream and Miss Rosa served syrupy fruit in a bunch of little bowls. Bucky had strawberry and blueberry syrup-fruit, and even some syrupy walnuts, and a yellow one that he thought was pineapple-n-syrup, too. All the fruits.

""What day ith it?"" Bucky asked as he polished off his fourth waffle.

""Christmas Eve. Big plans, today! Big plans."" Tony clapped his hands and rubbed them together. ""Darcy's coming down to the new clubhouse to help with some of the last minute renovations. You gonna come down to help before it's time to get ready for Christmas Eve dinner?""

""Umm..."" Bucky thought about it. ""I fink I'm a'ppothed ta hewp Mith Peppa' wif thomethin', but I don' 'memba' what.""

""Well, if you change your mind, remember to tell someone before you come down to the clubhouse, okay?"" Tony ruffled Bucky's hair, but in a nice way, like a hug. ""Oh, and Jarvis ordered those hankies for you. Should be here in a few hours. You'll need somewhere to put them away, so you might want to tidy up and make space in your room.""

Bucky stared at Tony, wondering why he'd need to make space for a few hankies in his underwear drawer where he always put them, but Tony didn't explain. For the day down at the clubhouse, Darcy had her special teal toolbox and her overalls and work boots on, so it musta been a workin' hard day for sure. Instead of her regular green coat, she put on a puffy shirt Tony called a shopcoat, and a pair of work gloves. Then, Tony braided Darcy's hair into two long braids starting at the very top of her head and going all the way down her back. When she was all ready and buttoned up, he pulled a knitted cap on over her braids and they headed out the door together, a hot rod red toolbox in one of Tony's hands and Darcy's free hand in the other.

A few hours later, Bucky found out why he'd need to make space in his room for hankies. Lots of space.

Jarvis announced a delivery for Master Barnes at the door. Miss Pepper and Nat followed Bucky to the window to peek outside. There was a man with a giant box out there!

""Howy cow! That'th a gian' boxth ou' dere!"" Bucky said.

The man asked Bucky to sign, but Bucky didn't know how to write the cursive yet. The man said it was okay to write 'BB' for Bucky Barnes, if Bucky could do that. Bucky wrote the neatest 'BB' he ever made. Nat told him he did a real good job, too. Then, she pulled a knife out of thin air like magic and carefully cut through the tape holding the box closed. when the delivery man left, Nat and Miss Pepper dragged the giant box over to the dining room and pulled back the flaps for Bucky to look inside.

""Whoa,"" he said real quiet. He looked up at the ceilin'. ""Thankth, Mithter Jarvith!""

""You are most welcome, Master Barnes, but Sir did the shopping himself. You'll find an array of fine, linen handkerchiefs in many shades of white and ivory for different styles of dress, organic, unbleached, cotton handkerchiefs for everyday use, organic cotton handkerchiefs in fun colors to match your many T-shirts, and a few sets of special handkerchiefs with matching bow ties, suspenders, and flat caps for more elegant dress occasions.""

One of Bucky's bunnies hopped over to nose at the packaging tape that fell on the floor. Bucky bent down to pat his head. ""Hi, Thid.""

""You named the bunnies?"" Miss Pepper asked, surprised.

""Thure. Mithter Bawton hewped, too. Thith ith Thid an' that'th Cwyde."" He pointed to the two grey, male bunnies.

Nat put a hand over her mouth and made a funny sound.

""Mickey an' Bonnie ar' under da couthch. They'we spotted all o'vuh. Mawwowy an' Nanthy ar' pwobwy thtiww upthtairth. They'we wight bwown.""

""You..."" Miss Pepper made a strange face. ""You named your bunnies Mickey and Mallory, Bonnie and Clyde, and Sid and Nancy?"" She looked a little faint.

""Mithter Bawton came up wif motht of 'em. I named Bonnie da Bunny mythelf, though."" He smiled real big.

""Bonnie is a wonderful name for a bunny."" Nat praised him and gave him a nice hug.

Then she looked at Pepper and pulled another face and Pepper jumped like she got goosed under her seat. ""Right! Bonnie is a wonderful name for a bunny. I'm sure they'll be wonderful pets.""

""The bunnies are litter-trained, too,"" Nat mentioned.

""Lovely."" Miss Pepper looked like she needed to lay down, but her phone pinged with a notipication. She looked at it. ""Uh oh. The children missed their flu shot appointment at the Tower health clinic. I completely forgot. Jarvis, can you notify Dr. Lin so he can arrange to make that up? This weekend, if possible.""

Bucky backed away. ""No mo' thotth! All Doctuh Win eva doeth ith gibe me thotth! My butt'th gonna be a pincuthion!"" He turned tail to run, but Nat snagged him by the back of his pants.

""What are you running from? No one is giving you a shot right now,"" she pointed out.

But Bucky's sore butt remembered the last shot a little too well. ""Fine, but no mo' thotth in m' butt. I gotta be able ta thit.""

""Fair enough. Your arm might be sore for a day or two, though.""

""Don't cawe. Sweepin' wif an achin' hiney ith the wortht.""

""I'll discuss it with Dr. Lin--if you promise not to run away when it's time for more shots,"" Nat bargained.

""Deal."" Bucky held up his pinky for the pinky swear to seal the deal and Nat shook it. Then he leaned over to look in the box again. ""It thure wath nithe of Tony to thend me all thith gweat thtuff, but I got nowhewe to weaw all thethe thwell thuthpenderth and bow tieth and fwat capth."" He pulled out a red and green pinstripe plaid set with matching hankies.

""You can wear them for the Christmas party and midnight mass. There's a chapel right here at the camp and an interfaith minister will be conducting the service. We'll have cookies and cocoa before, and a nice, early dinner and Christmas party that lasts late into the night on Christmas Day tomorrow.""

""An' we get to dweth up weal nithe?"" Boy, that sounded fun! Bucky could wear his new suspenders and bow tie and flat cap! ""Will it be a danthin' party? I don' know how ta danthe tho good yet."" Bucky scuffed the toe of his sneaker against the box.

""Ask Steve. He can teach you,"" Nat said, but she said it in that way that meant she was bein' cheeky.

""Thteebie can danthe?"" Bucky was pretty sure he made a face, even though he didn't mean to.

""Sure he can. He's always telling us what we do isn't real dancing. He must know some great dances. We'll do all of them, twice,"" she insisted.

""Ya thay dat wike it'th twue, but I get da feewin' ya puwwing my weg, Nat.""

She held up her finger and thumb very close together and smiled the smile with all the dimples in her cheeks. Bucky's favorite Nat smile. ""Only a little. Dancing is supposed to be fun, sweetie, not a competition. Who cares if you do it right? Who cares if there  is  a right way?""

Bucky cared, but he wasn't sure why. ""Wiww Darthy be at da party?"" Another scufflin' kick to the box.

This time, Miss Pepper made the cheeky smile. ""Absolutely.""

""Please excuse the interruption,"" Jarvis' voice surprised Bucky while Nat helped him sort and put away his new belongings. As was his way, Tony went above and beyond, not just slipping a few sets of accessories in with Bucky's precious hoard of new hankies, but also a pair of neat button-down shirts in steel blue and charcoal grey, and sturdy, dark jeans for him to pair with his snappy new ensembles for the holidays. At the bottom of the box, sat a pair of black canvas basketball shoes that had a vintage 20s look, too. She all but peeled Bucky off of the boxes of things that reminded him of his own time. Tony Stark never ceased to surprise Natasha with his kindness and generosity in the right ways, she thought with an unaccustomed fondness.

For a while now, Bucky's obvious homesickness for familiarity weighed on Steve's conscience like lead. Bucky's ma, his home, Brooklyn, the little day in and day out things people no longer needed to do, thanks to modern conveniences. As small as it might seem to someone else, Natasha knew those basketball shoes and hankies represented a precious link to home for little Bucky Barnes. She'd have to find some way to thank the engineer for his thoughtfulness without letting him think she was softening towards him. She liked keeping him on edge in her company, just a little.

""Master Barnes' presence has been requested at the boathouse,"" The A.I. continued.

""What'th a boathouthe?"" Bucky asked, picking at a fresh scab on his elbow.

""The building adjacent to the left side of the Recreation Pavilion, as you face the lake, currently serves as Sir's and Miss' workshop.""

Natasha smiled when Bucky held up his hands in front the way Steve showed him to see which thumb and forefinger made the shape of an ""L"" to indicate the left.

""The captain recommends you wear garments appropriate for--and I quote--getting filthy. Several projects are currently in progress in the workshop. Thick denim trousers or overalls and a fitted, cotton shirt appear to be the order of the day,"" the A.I. informed him.

But Natasha was already pulling out a pair of thick canvas dungarees and a fresh, silly T-shirt with a more fitted shape like the ones Tony preferred to wear to avoid getting clothes caught up in equipment or snagged on sharp objects. The purple print on dark navy cotton proclaimed, ""the DIEM AIN'T GONNA CARPE itself"".

Still running on an extreme sugar high from his calorie-laden breakfast with Tony, Bucky could hardly stand still long enough for Natasha to help him pull the shirt over his head and lace up his steel-toed work boots--another surprise from Tony when he began tutoring Bucky in basic programming and robot-building in his workshop back in the city. Somehow, Tony always knew just what a busy little boy needed to keep him out of trouble--the ventilation adventure being the rare exception.

When the two of them reached the bottom of the grand staircase, they spotted Pepper and Rosa in the great room with their heads bent over a large binder.

""The menu is fine, Rosa,"" Pepper said, ""but in these quantities on the shopping list ... I just don't think this is enough with Steve, Clint, Sam, Kate, and Natasha all coming to dinner. The team is very active. They burn through a  lot  of calories. Steve consumes nearly eight thousand calories by himself on a normal day with light activity. In fact, with last night's mission complete, he's probably done nothing but eat today.""

Rosa looked surprised at that revelation, then narrowed her eyes in suspicion. ""I watch to make sure he eats and likes what I make. He eats the same as everyone else.""

Clearing her throat, Natasha gleefully threw Steve under the bus, ""He doesn't like making more work for you with all you have to do managing the estate and feeding so many guests. He's been going into town twice a day to run errands and stopping at the diner for high-calorie, in-between meals. He tends to snack in the middle of the night, too, so if your leftovers are disappearing...""

Rosa gasped. ""He pays to eat  Martha's  cooking at the diner when he could be  at home  being fed good, home-cooked--"" She switched to Italian and swore up and down Steve Rogers' patriotic, lying hide in ways Natasha wasn't certain the language of the Renaissance masters had ever been used before.

""I'll talk to him about it,"" Natasha promised the housekeeper, extending an olive branch on Steve's behalf to make up for ratting him out in the first place, just a little. He meant well, after all. ""I'll make very clear to him that you'd rather feed him til he bursts than have your good reputation suffer in the community because he goes into town to eat. The guilt will have him eating extra meals just to make it up to you."" She winked and Rosa subsided.

""Good, you tell him--"" She stopped, lowered the irate index finger with which she'd nearly launched her next tirade, and eyed Natasha shrewdly. ""Pepper says you burn the calories, too. From now on, you both eat more and you make me a list of your favorites. This one, too."" She cupped Bucky's chin.

""I think ya waffleth n' thuga' fwuitth ar' thwell, Mith Wotha."" Bucky grinned. Little brown-noser.

""I know you do, luce dei miei occhi. That's why you and the little wrecking ball are i miei piccoli. You eat my waffles and sugar fruit all day."" She kissed his nose. Bucky squirmed and blushed to the roots of his hair. ""That means--"" she began to explain, but Bucky cut her off.

"" 'Light'a my eyeth' and 'my wittle oneth'."" He grinned his toothless grin, pleased with himself, rocking on the balls of his feet with his hands stuffed in his pockets.

""How do you know that?"" She tapped his chin like a proud auntie.

""I'm fwom Bwookwyn."" He shrugged as if that explained it all.

It did, Natasha supposed. Steve often mentioned their tenement and the one across the way, growing up, were a mishmash of immigrants from all over Europe which is why he found the western European languages so easy to assimilate when it came time to study a new one. He had an ear for most, if not all of them.

But Brooklyn of the year twenty-sixteen bore little resemblance to the Brooklyn Bucky remembered. Rosa remarked to the women, ""It's times like this it's most obvious, you know. Sweet boy."" She squished his cheeks. ""I'll make you a big bowl of ravioli tonight, like my grandma made for Antony when he was a boy and she wanted to love on him, too.""

""Thankth, Mith Wotha."" Bucky hid his face in Natasha's hip.

""You're welcome. Come, I'll go with you. We'll straighten out the captain and this diner business.""

""Really, Rosa, it's no trouble, I'll lay it on thick.""

""No,"" she cut off the Black Widow. ""I'll tell him, make him look me in the eye when he tells me he ate Martha's chewy chicken and instant potatoes. Instant. Pah!"" she spat as she bundled Bucky into his puffy vest and gloves, and grabbed her own coat. ""She buys her pasta in bulk, too, dried, if you can believe it, like a Neanderthal!"" She stomped down the stairs and Bucky stomped right along with her, a little 'somebody's gonna get it' bounce in his step.

Waving Pepper off with a smile, Natasha trailed the housekeeper across well-worn paths and down a wide staircase of flagstone to the boathouse. The unmistakable clatter of busywork came from within. Rosa's nostrils flared like a bull about to charge when she spied Steve through a window, lifting half of a hoagie to his mouth--a hoagie Rosa didn't make (made with bread she didn't bake, using God only knows what kind of bottled dressing and limp tomato slices!).

Then, THEN, she threw open the door and gasped at the sight of Darcy sucking on a lollipop  from the store! 

""Before you yell--"" Tony held up both hands in a gesture of supplication like he knew what they did and thought he could still avert the apocalypse about to rain down from on high. ""Jarvis bought her the lollipops. They're organic, made with vegetable coloring and real cane sugar. She likes to chew while she works."" Indeed, the little girl bent over her tiny work bench, observing as U and Dum-E sliced prepared lengths of PVC pipe with a tiny laser cutter. A stretched, knitted hat that had seen better days covered her dutch-braided hair. The ""Daddy's Little Demolition Crew"" T-shirt under her overalls wasn't much better off. Her little brown work boots were scuffed and a smear of axel grease stained her cheek.

""Piccola,"" Rosa cooed, smiling sweetly when Darcy's head turned at the familiar nickname. ""You don't want to eat those. You don't know who made that, tesoro mia... I make you lollipops, from peaches and grapes and apples I grew with my own hands in  my  dirt. You don't know where their dirt has been, cara.""

Popping the sweet out of her mouth, Darcy eyed it like it might actually have been born of tainted dirt. Skipping across the workshop, she placed it neatly in the tissue Rosa held out for the offending treat.

Then Rosa turned on Tony like a pit viper,  ""You!""  She pointed at him like she'd light him on fire with eyes and determination alone. ""You don't feed this sweet baby anything but the best from now on. Or this one."" She cupped Bucky's chin lovingly again. ""He eats my food and I reward him with handmade marshmallows. You--"" She stalked up to Iron Man and poked him in the arc reactor. ""You encourage your friends to lie to me."" She rounded on Steve and propped her hands on her ample hips. ""It's not good enough? What's wrong with my food, Capitano America? ""

""Not a damn thing! Uh ... ma'am."" He actually tried to hide the half-eaten hoagie behind his back. Limp, shredded lettuce fell to the floor like sad confetti. Butterfingers helpfully pushed a squeegee through it, mashing it to a pale green paste.

Natasha sighed. ""The jig is up, Rogers. She knows about the twice-daily runs to the diner."" Then she winked just to screw with his head because they both knew damn well it was more often than not  three  daily trips to the diner when he cleared out the leftovers at midnight and came upstairs still ravenously hungry, looking for the keys to the jeep.

Captain America, Steven Grant Rogers, quaked in his boots like a misbehaving school boy.

""Tell me."" Rosa drifted close enough to make him very uncomfortable. ""You ate Martha's meatloaf. It was terrible, wasn't it? Her chicken, an abomination. You can tell me the truth. It stays between us.""

Steve looked to Tony for help, but Stark was a man who knew when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em. He sidled out of Rosa's reach and scurried over to help Darcy and Bucky set up a painting booth for whatever mystery gifts the two of them were building.

""Uh, uh, u-hem,"" Steve cleared his throat, glanced at his shoes, pleaded silently with Natasha, and got nothing. Peering down into the soulful brown eyes of a woman who loved Bucky like his own sweet auntie, Steve folded like a house of cards. ""I'm so sorry. I'll never do it again. It's just--I'm so hungry all the time since the serum and you work so hard with all you do taking care of everyone and I didn't want to be a burden and I eat a lot and after all those months in the army, I could survive on styrofoam, if it's got enough calories. My palate is hardly a good judge of wonderful homemade food like yours.""

They stood in humming silence for several moments, staring into one another's eyes.

Natasha held her breath.

""Good answer,"" Rosa said grudgingly, crossing her arms and retreating half a step. ""Don't think I don't notice how you say nothing bad about Martha's lousy cooking, but loyalty is an attractive quality. I'll make you something good, enough that you beg me to stop bringing more. Okay?"" She patted his cheek and flounced out of the boathouse.

""Whew! Tha' wath a clothe one, Thteebie. I wath thure thee wath gonna make ya peel potatoeth a' thomethin',"" Bucky said, looking relieved on his best friend's behalf.

A moment too soon, unfortunately.

""You're right, caro mio."" Rosa leaned back into the room and grabbed Steve by the belt loop. ""Come. You peel potatoes, do penance for keeping secrets nobody should keep.""

Steve went.

This chapter serves as the intro to a fun Avengers-childhood-Christmas clip show chapter next. I GET TO WRITE THAT ON CHRISTMAS! *bounces* 

Like many of you, I'll be joining the Christmas celebrators in my family this evening for a meal, the ritual slaughter of shellfish and other terrifying beasts of the deep, that once swam, burrowed, or scuttled. There will be much melted, lactose-free butter and the shell carnage will be mighty. TONIGHT, WE FEAST!

May your own holiday celebration be merry, bright, or whatever you wish, and your families happy, healthy, and well. Merry Winterfest! (^_^)

One-word prompt: fluffiness (Thanks, seacat! Your prompt inspired the whole Christmas weekend arc!)

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

""Any idea what it is they're making?"" Natasha asked Tony as Darcy and Bucky sprayed everything inside the painting booth without rhyme or reason.

""No, and Jarvis isn't telling, either."" Tony winced when the spray nozzle jammed and buckled in Darcy's hand, but U was already on it, flipping the machine off and replacing the nozzle so the project could be finished in time to dry. ""Whatever it is, it required several large orders of store-bought marshmallows, and the only reason Rosa would even let that many verboten treats through the front door is if no one planned to eat them.""

""Interesting."" And darling, really, that the two children wanted to make gifts, rather than go on the shopping spree Tony would have happily sponsored, if they asked.

""That's one word for it."" But Tony smiled the smile of a new father, smitten with riches that couldn't be counted in dollar signs.

Natasha chuckled and shifted her weight, watching with a small smile, too, as the children argued over which colors made the best camouflage. Despite her love for all things teal, Darcy was solidly in the greens and greys camo camp, while Bucky preferred neon green and electric blue. It made a certain kind of sense--Bucky's attraction to painfully bright colors. Day-Glo colors must seem like a feast for the eyes, having grown up in 1920s Brooklyn.

""Time to wrap this up."" She clapped her hands, drawing the argument to an end. ""We have midnight mass and a late dinner to attend, which means you both need to lay down and try to nap for a bit this afternoon.""

""Can we thweep on da thofa bed in da woft?"" He pointed north, towards the Rec Pavilion.

Tony shook his head. ""Sorry, kiddo. There's a project underway in the loft, too, but there's a brand new sofa bed by the fireplace on the main floor over there. You sure you wanna do that, though? Might not be very quiet with everyone coming and going.""

But Darcy was already drooping and slurring her words. ""Jarvis promised me and Bucky a slideshow ob bideos an' pi'tures from Chrissmsses pas' if we coul'n't seep,"" she garbled as Tony picked her up and settled her against his shoulder.

""Ah."" Natasha nodded. ""Now Jarvis' request for family Christmas albums makes sense."" She sighed. ""I don't have much, but there are probably a few photos on Clint's private server in Bed-Stuy of the Christmas after he brought me in. If Clint will give you access to the server, you're welcome to use whatever family-friendly photos of me you can find from previous holidays, Jarvis.""

""Certainly, Agent Romanova, and thank you. Due to their circumstances, I believe Miss Stark and Master Barnes have been especially curious about how other members of their found family grew up and spent the holidays. When I offered to create this slideshow, I failed to take into account how non-traditional the formative years of the Avengers might have been. It has been ... a challenge.""

""Tell the others all of that and send out the request again, Jarvis. I think I'd like to see your Avengers formative years slideshow, too.""

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

The Avengers are treated to a multi-media family slideshow of Christmases past curated by Jarvis with help from a few Avenger-adjacent friends, beginning with Rhodey, Tony, and Pepper.

This chapter is the technical end of my 25-day daily writing challenge! I DID THE THING!!! It is not the end of this story, though! More to come tomorrow!

One-word prompt: silence

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

""Das m' Uncle Rhodey,"" Darcy said as the team reconvened on the sectional in the rec room after the workshop was picked up and the tools returned to their rightful places along the walls. Even Steve and Rosa joined the group in the rec room, lugging along several pots and bowls full of potatoes for peeling. Rosa's oldest pressed a peeler into Sam's empty hand and set a sack of potatoes down between them while Rosa's younger daughters chattered quietly in the kitchen under the loft, making good use of the canning kitchen to put together some light, pre-dinner nibbles for the impromptu slideshow viewing party.

As the lights dimmed, the image on the silver screen over the fireplace came into focus with sharper contrast. Several photos from Colonel Rhodes' childhood flickered on screen. Playing with G.I. Joes and Matchbox cars under the tree with children who could only be cousins or brothers, for their similarity of their features. Same nose, same chin, even the same hairline.

Rhodey joked, ""My mom and aunts called us the Rhodes Clones for years. These are my cousins, Bobby, Will, and Jeff. We were all born within six months of each other, and all with our grandfather's face. My mom still mixes us up when we're all in a room together."" His lips lifted in a half-smile. ""She went to Trinidad for the holidays this year, but she's making noises about a family picnic for Memorial Day. We better save the world between now and then because they all have kids and my mother is going to ask again why I don't.""

Tony raised a hand and pointed at the groggy little girl in his lap. ""Be sure and show her the photos of you helping your goddaughter program her first R/C drone. Should buy you at least another year or two.""

Rhodey nodded and admitted, ""That might do it.""

""Better yet, tell her to bring everyone up here for Memorial Day. We'll do a big weekend thing, open the boathouse for the summer, all the summer stuff--water slide, rope swing, water skiing, all the kid stuff.""

""I'll mention it,"" Rhodey promised when Darcy's tiny hand gripped his in lieu of her usual big, hopeful eyes.

""You do that,"" Tony insisted as the slideshow progressed to the later years of Rhodey's childhood. Early admittance to MIT, like Tony, but a bit older and more mature than the fourteen year old wunderkind friend he made over the holiday break that year.

Rhodey explained, ""I stuck around campus to squeeze in an intensive winter break session for a science credit. Stumbled across this one, carrying a pair of pizza boxes into the engineering lab with a stolen pass he swiped from our TA.""

Tony joined in, ""Things were still a bit tense at home, after a small misunderstanding over the summer.""

Rosa laughed and cast a knowing glance at her employer. Steve wondered what that was about.

Homey scenes of other holiday meals and moments flipped by, all featuring Tony surrounded by people who were definitely not Howard and Maria. Steve felt the same bone-deep disappointment in his former friend he always felt when reminded of how Howard failed to see what his indifference cost his son. 

Peggy provided a bright spot in the otherwise disheartening montage, but Tony smiled at all of it, pleased by whomever and whatever he remembered happening in the wordless, recorded moments on screen. The home movies from the late sixties had no sound. Tony, just a baby, in Peggy's arms as Howard mouthed clearly for the camera, ""The proud godmother."" In the background, a rarely seen male figure followed the baby's movements as he was passed from Peggy to Dugan to Morita to Jones to Dernier, each one laughing and cooing and generally looking like idiotic, doting uncles.

In the next home movie, Edwin Jarvis and Dum Dum jogged alongside a wobbling four or five year old Tony as he kicked off the low curb and away from training wheels he could only have removed himself, judging by the terror on Jarvis' face. Meanwhile, a very small Tony cackled with glee as he got the hang of the balance needed, and shot down the long alley between Stark House and the Vanderbilt townhome in Manhattan.

Bucky, tucked under Steve's arm, said with a sleepy, wistful note, ""That'th a thwell bithicle."" Tony met Steve's gaze over Bucky's head and gave the barest of nods, fishing his phone from his pocket to text a special request to his A.I.

The video featuring the beribboned two-wheeler came to an end when the videographer lowered the camera, revealing the tips of a pair of women's pumps, scuffed on the left toe in just the same spot Peggy always had from the way she kicked her shoes off under the bed at the end of a long day. Always the left first, right into the back of her footlocker. It was nice to know some things never changed.

""Hey, das my daddy, too,"" Darcy's voice brightened. She sat up in Tony's lap, giving the screen her full attention as a six or seven year old Tony assembled a complex-looking model train display with Ana and Edwin, once again at Stark House for the holidays. Tony fiddled and jiggered, finally flicking a switch and grinning in triumph when all the tiny buildings and Christmas trees and streetlights in the miniature railroad town flickered to life. Jarvis clapped Tony on the shoulder and it was obvious to anyone with eyes how he congratulated and praised the young genius on a job well done. Something else Howard had failed at time and again, otherwise they'd likely refer to the the all-knowing A.I. who helped manage their lives as 'Howard' rather than 'Jarvis'.

Another scene faded in, this time of a twelve year old Tony standing in an open doorway in the main lodge at Camp Stark with a brunette girl of about the same age who could have been another of Rosa's daughters, if not for the telltale beauty mark above her right eyebrow. So this was young Rosa.

To the left of frame, Dernier pointed to the mistletoe over their heads. Tony blushed scarlet, tripped over his own feet, and collided with the doorway. Distracted while he rubbed at the ache in his shoulder, he never saw young Rosa coming before she planted a kiss on his lips that could only be described as life-changing. In that moment, Tony Stark finally discovered the ancient and wondrous mystery of girls, and what a girl to lead him to the light. Rosa looked right into the lens and winked before flouncing away as the Commandos framed in the shot howled with delight. Twelve year old Tony stared after her with a witless grin and stars in his eyes.

Grownup Tony took the ribbing from his friends like a champ, graciously accepting a buss on the cheek from his childhood friend and one-time sweetheart while Pepper claimed the other cheek and Darcy grinned at all three.

Fresh scenes colored in earthy shades Steve recently came to associate with the nineteen-seventies set the new home video stage. A girl with limbs like a gawky fawn moved across the ice, occasionally creating more elegant figures with skates that looked almost too large for her willowy frame. Her cropped, strawberry blonde hair fell short of her ears, styled to slope away from her face.

""The Dorothy Hamill wedge was all the rage. I was so sure I'd be the next great American Olympic sweetheart with enough practice and the right haircut, but along came Mary Lou Retton with her adorable button nose and petite frame, and 'tall and slim' went out with the seventies like yesterday's news,"" Pepper lamented with an exaggerated sigh.

""My sweetheart,"" Tony declared, laying a hand on her knee in their old, familiar way.

""Daddy's sweetheart,"" Darcy echoed, nuzzling into the tiny space between them.

""One of,"" Pepper corrected with a smile, turning into Tony's side to cuddle the five year old.

The ice skating home movie came to an end and audio playback began of an old conversation between the two lovebirds.

""Whatever you need, Mr. Stark, of course,"" younger Pepper's voice rang out in the silent room. The low lights of the Christmas tree glowed softly in the corner when the screen stayed dark for the audio replay.

""What I need is for you to do your job like it's your job, Miss Potts,"" younger Tony slurred. ""Including, in this case, rescheduling this meeting for when I'm less drunk and also not me.""

""You'd like someone else to take a meeting of this importance with representatives of the United States Air Force?""

""I'd like someone else to be me, but, yes, someone else who could sit in on my--hey, you know what? You're smart. You do it.""

""Mr. Stark, I'm a personal assistant, fresh out of business school. I'm hardly qualified to take meetings on behalf of Stark Industries' CEO--""

""You are literally the most qualified person I have ever met."" Tony belched delicately and cursed under his breath at Dum-E. ""I said '   person' ; don't get your rear axle housing in a wad, asshole.""

""Ooh... Daddy said a bad word."" Darcy's sleepy eyes widened in surprise.

""There are no such things as bad words, only limited vocabularies,"" Pepper reminded Darcy.

""Daddy used his milited vocab'alaries"" Darcy promptly parroted, surprising a laugh out of the adults in the room.

On the recording, the familiar sound of high heels echoed, followed by the thunk of a heavy door and Tony's much less drunk-sounding voice, ""Hey Jarvis, let's find out what kind of perfume Miss Potts prefers, shall we? And clear my schedule for the rest of the week so she has a few extra days to spend with her parents over the holidays. RSVP to that invite to Georgetown. Let's see if Happy's in the mood; we'll go mooch off of Aunt Peg for a few days. She'll be so happy to fuss over us lonely orphans, she'll forget to miss Uncle Niel for a while, if we play our cards right.""

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

Clint and Tony met long before the Chitauri invasion, but memories are fickle things.

I really went ham on these flashback slideshow scenes--there are a few more to come after this, too! (Wherein, readers get to peek at all the loose Chrissi headcanons rambling around upstairs.) Please note that the Christmas party mentioned in this update is NOT the one that Tony attends in the clip from last chapter. This scene includes a much younger, brattier Tony. Btw, my Ask Box on tumblr is still open for one-word prompts for this series! (Or leave them in the comments below!)

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

""Really, Peg? You invited your pet thug?"" The sound of Howard's voice surprised Steve and Tony when an obviously young Clint Barton appeared on screen next, bracketed on either side by a familiar face. Gabe Jones and Jacques Dernier.

At the end of the sectional sofa at Camp Stark, Barton's hand covered a pleasantly surprised smile as he watched the scene play out from his youth.

The camera panned to Peggy's unamused expression. ""He's no thug, Howard, honestly. I'll grant you 'delinquent' at seventeen, but he's hardly had a good example to live by and he won't have if he spends every waking hour locked up and  treated  like a thug with no one to provide a good example from which he may learn.""

""And you're relying on the Commandos for that?"" Howard snickered.

""They do alright with Anthony.""

""Anthony lives well within the law, thank you very much, Margaret Elizabeth Mary.""

Peggy looked into the camera with wide, exasperated eyes before rolling them hard left.

""Well, don't sit him near me at dinner--God, I hope you're putting him in the kitchen with the help where he belongs.""

""Now why would I do that?""

""What are the chances the little beast can tell the difference between his salad and dinner forks?""

Peggy snorted. ""After your third scotch, can you?""

To which Howard said nothing, turning to his left and pretending the conversation was over while Peggy muttered something like ""and they say we English are such dreadful snobs"" under her breath.

""Come in, come in,"" she called to Clint and her old friends, crossing the elegant foyer of her townhouse in Georgetown to welcome the new guests and take their coats. Steve had enjoyed several breakfasts at the house with Peg and her adult children. Adult children whose own children were closer in age to Steve than they themselves. Perhaps 'enjoyed' was too strong a word for those meals. More like 'tolerated for Peg's sake'. Those tedious breakfasts never did much to endear Peg's kids to Steve when they spent the entire meal reminding their mother she wasn't getting any younger and what a risk living alone with her third husband at their advanced age would soon become. Hale and hearty in her early nineties, Peggy looked nothing to Steve like the frail old woman her children presumed her to be. More than once, she remarked on how she considered selling the old house and just disappearing off the map where Daniel Junior and Anna couldn't follow and nag her into an early grave, but then there were the great-grandchildren to consider, not that they had much use for her, either, she supposed.

Retirement was the bitterest pill for Peg to swallow, but the official story given out was how the wicked ache in her bad knee couldn't be ignored with a busy director's schedule at the agency, so sweet, elder Peggy spent her days making the rounds of charitable foundations in the nation's capitol and teaching a new generation to wish they'd never met her. Steve attended one of her meetings on the Hill with the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Showed up, arm in arm with Captain America and squeezed an extra ten million into the budget for the VAs in D.C. and Brooklyn. Steve happily volunteered to attend any future such meetings on her arm as well, if it would guarantee similar results.

""Hill!"" Peggy called on screen. A young and fresh-faced Maria Hill rose from the gathering of young and up-and-coming agents by the fireplace to cross the room in slim burgundy trousers and a smart, ivory blouse. At Peggy's side, she looked a bit less statuesque and overall impressive. Such qualities, Steve assumed, would mature with age. She couldn't have been more than eighteen or twenty in the home movie. ""I'd like to introduce you to young Mr. Barton,"" Peggy continued. ""Clint, this is Probationary Agent Maria Hill. Maria, soon-to-be Probationary Agent Clint Barton--""

""Your academy provisional this semester?"" Hill interrupted, then halted when tense silence greeted her gaffe. ""Apologies, Director."" Maria ducked her head and stared at the bottom of her glass, swirling melting ice cubes and trying to disappear into the floor.

But Peggy was quick to forgive and carry on in her way. ""My provisional choice for the academy this semester, yes. He's a helluva shot, whatever we put in his hands. You'll be partnering him on the range, last I heard."" And oh, what a painful moment to witness. Hill's face just had not yet developed the skill to hide her distaste for that particular assignment. There was no mistaking her displeasure.

In the rec pavilion, Clint and Natasha both clapped hands over their mouths and choked on laughter.

""You'll both be working with Agent Coulson, at my behest. He's well-suited to handling an elite academy team such as yours with unique skill sets. He answers to Agent Fury. Your team won't be tied down by the typical prerequisites, requirements, and red tape. You're welcome,"" she said pointedly, then smiled benevolently when both of them straightened their posture and squared their shoulders.

Agent Fury,  with a full head of hair, stood on the far side of the room, arms crossed, glaring at anyone that moved within striking distance of his personal bubble while he chatted with other members of what Steve assumed must be S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy faculty or senior agents, one of whom appeared to be a young Phil Coulson in his usual suit and tie.

Beyond all of them, in the window of the pass-thru to the kitchen, a blonde head bobbed along to some modern Christmas tune, popping out through the crowd to jabber at Fury.

Blonde, willow slim, and still gawky at thirteen or fourteen years old, Sharon Carter's lightly freckled face was unmistakable, despite braces with bright red and green rubber bands and a pair of sparkling, holiday-themed butterfly clips holding back the hair at her temples. God, she was just a baby!

""She's going to kill all of us flatter than dead when she finds out we've seen this, you know,"" Rhodey pointed out from his spot perched on the back rest of the couch.

Tony craned his neck to cast a surprised glance at his best friend. ""And what makes you think you know so much about how Carter's going to react--""

The rec pavilion door swung open with a cool gust of winter wind and the lady in question stood, silhouetted in the wash of light from the holiday decorations draped along the porch rail. ""Because he invited me as his guest,"" she said, hefting a box and entering the room, hips swinging in that absolutely assured way all the Carter women moved. ""Jarvis said if I hurried I might make it in time to see some old family home movies,"" she explained, then stopped and dropped the box with a clatter when she spotted her much younger self on screen. ""Where did you get this?"" she demanded.

""Major Dugan and Director Carter were most gracious in supplying my request for footage of past Christmases from the S.H.I.E.L.D. and Stark archives,"" Jarvis attempted to placate the agent.

Sharon closed her eyes, hung her head, and muttered, ""Uncle Dum Dum. Should have known.""

Tony held a fist up to bump Carter's. ""Right? You should'a seen the ones they sent of me.""

""You and Rosa?"" Carter's dimples deepened and her eyes sparkled.

""You  put her up to that one, didn't you?"" Tony curled his lip. ""Serves you right, traitor."" He huffed and crossed his arms over Darcy's shoulders.

But the home movie hadn't finished with them yet. The front door of Peggy's home popped open again and Tony burst through, arms draped across the shoulders of svelte blonde twins. Models, maybe, or heiress socialites... Steve couldn't tell, but Tony groaned and mumbled, ""Not the Hyatt twins. Ugh. Sorry in advance, Pep.""

The apology was more than warranted. The twins giggled and carried on with little concern for where they were or in whose company. Howard grunted in disgust and stalked off to the bar while Tony made the rounds, saying quick, obnoxious hellos to everyone he knew, including young Sharon.

He ruffled her hair. ""Hey, pipsqueak. They finally letting you stay up after The Muppet Show?""

""Fuck off, Tony,"" she growled and stomped on his foot, before following Howard to the bar.

""Merry Christmas to you, too, you tiny, judgmental ass-- Aunt Peggy!"" He threw his arms wide.

But Peggy was having none of it. ""Are you stoned, or drunk and stoned?"" she demanded.

""Aunt Peggy,"" Tony gasped and patted his chest with false innocence. ""I would never--""

""Indeed. Please take the DoubleMint Twins and go find a glass of water. Only water. I'll have Edwards see you home.""

""No need. Happy's parking the car and Rhodey's around here--"" He looked over his shoulder. Rhodey, in his shiny new Air Force uniform, waited by the door, hat in hand, ready to intervene, if needed.

""Lord..."" Peggy shook her head. ""Why that young man puts up with you, I'll never understand, Anthony.""

""I'm lovable, Aunt Peg."" He pecked her on the cheek.

""A good thing, too. Do try to sober up while I offer Mr. Rhodes a break from playing nanny to a nearly grown man for ten minutes, hmm?""

The screen faded to black as Peggy brushed aside Rhodey's offered handshake to kiss him on the cheek and take his arm. ""Come, let me introduce you to some friends. You've heard of the Howling Commandos, haven't you, darling?""

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

The next home movie faded in as Sharon climbed over the back of the couch to settle in the spot beside Rhodey.

""Your new friend seems to be adapting about as well the dinosaurs,"" Hill muttered on screen, touching a beer bottle to her lips and tilting her head toward the balcony doors of Clint's Bed-Stuy apartment building.

""I thought the dinosaurs went ext--"" He stopped, face pinched, and glared at Hill.

""Twenty says she murders you in your sleep.""

""What even is my incentive to bet with you right now?""

Hill must have made a face because no one said anything for a moment.

""She's gonna be okay. She's new to celebrating the holidays. Just give her a chance to warm up."" Clint leaned over and pushed down the camera lens, hissing, ""And put that away. I know observation was part of the deal until she's acclimated, but making her feel like a fish in a fishbowl isn't going to help right now."" The cameraperson held the camera at their side, but continued to film discreetly. For several long minutes, the group watched as Natasha sat on the lone seat to one side of Clint's haphazardly decorated balcony with her back to a wall strung with twinkling, outdoor lights. She spoke quietly in unaccented English, offering bits and nibbles from the dish on the table by her side to the one-eyed dog laying with his snout propped up on her leg on the opposite side. Pizza. She was hand-feeding Pizza Dog bits of pepperoni pizza from her own plate.

When the dog settled down with his head on her lap and a full belly, Clint opened the slider and squatted beside his future partner to scratch the dog's head. ""Looks like you made a new friend.""

Nat sighed and trained her gaze on the horizon. ""He's your dog. I wouldn't expect him to have any more self-preservation than his owner.""

Clint scoffed. ""Who's his owner? He does what he wants. I'm just the guy who pays for his pizza habit.""

""I feel like there's some metaphor in there I should be taking to heart, but if it's that I belong to no one, I don't appreciate being compared to a scruffy mutt.""

""Just pointing out that Pizza Dog is free to come and go as he likes. No expectations there. We're pals because we both want to be.""

Natasha nodded, murmuring quietly, ""You're too trusting, Clint.""

""Merry Christmas anyway, Nataliya.""

""Natasha,"" she corrected him. ""Call me Natasha.""

""Any particular reason?""

She shrugged. ""Nataliya needs to be laid to rest.""

""Ah, this is a phoenix rising from the ashes thing?""

""A phoenix?""

""It's a story about a bird that doesn't die. It probably looks like shit for a while near the end, but then it molts, and like, bursts into flames, and a new bird with new ideas and purpose and no mistakes in it yet is born from the ashes of the old bird. No egg, just a rebirth. Like, um... Fire is cleansing, I guess. I don't know."" Clint and rousing speeches were like oil and water, apparently.

Natasha smiled. ""We have a mythical creature in Russian folklore, The Firebird. I don't think ours is the same, though.""

Scratching his head, Clint grimaced. ""I don't think so, either. Coulson would probably know. Books aren't really my thing.""

""It's okay."" She laid her hand on Clint's, initiating touch for perhaps the first time. ""Fairy tales aren't really my thing, either.""

""I'm glad you're here, Natasha."" Clint twitched as if he wanted to hug her, but knew better.

""So ... am I."" She squeezed his hand. ""Thank you, Clint.""

""Wanna get some cocoa and do this Christmas thing right?""

""There's a right away to Christmas?""

""Yup, and anyone who says otherwise is doing it wrong. Come on. It starts with Fun Size Snickers and candy canes in your mug."" He tugged on her hand until she followed him back inside to raid the kitchen for everything they'd need.

Jarvis' voice interjected quietly, ""The children seem to have fallen asleep for the time being. Shall I pause the slideshow or--""

""No!"" everyone said at the same time.

""What else ya got, J?"" Tony carefully modulated his voice to avoid waking the child in his lap. ""Anything of Darcy? Probably shouldn't watch their adult home movies while they're awake, but if it's just us...""

""There are some videos of Miss Stark, yes. I hesitated to play them while she was awake due to the presence of Thor and Dr. Foster in the first, and, of course, Agent Barton in the second. It's ... a very informal video.""

Clint squinted at the nearest camera used by Jarvis. ""The second one... Is that pulled from the S.H.I.E.L.D. archival footage of Foster's lab security?""

""It is,"" the A.I. answered.

""Yeah, definitely don't play that while she's awake, bud. Good call.""

""I'm relieved to know you agree. Shall I play them now, or hold them for later?""

Clint checked to make sure Darcy and Bucky were out. ""I think now is fine.""

""Thanks, J."" Tony lifted a hand to signal the A.I. to continue the show, but kept a wary eye on Barton as Foster's lab faded in on screen.

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

Clint and Nat bring in Darcy.

I SWEAR, I have a really good reason for this Christmas Eve slideshow and I'm just going to ask you to trust me to make it worth your time and effort, okay? Because I have a spoilery secret and it is KILLING ME not to tell you all yet, but you'll find out ... umm ... next chapter, maybe...? *crumples under the pressure of secret-keeping* Also, I sent the four five-chapter epilogue outline to my betas last night. You guys don't mind me dragging out the Darcy/Bucky parts of this fic, like, forever, right?

As for this chapter: tiny, little tissue warning, maybe...?

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

Once upon a time, Darcy Lewis co-habitated in a rickety old trailer home in Puente Antiguo with Dr. Jane Foster, watched over by a S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance crew of more than a dozen, headed up first, by Agent Clint Barton, and later handled by Agent Phil Coulson. Taking no chances with the foremost authority on Einstein-Rosen Bridge theory and practical application in the world (and her wackadoodle support staff), S.H.I.E.L.D. covered every square inch of Foster's lab, exterior, roof, basement, crawl spaces, favorite haunts in town, and even the back alley they liked to take as a shortcut home from the bar on Karaoke Fridays.

No one in the lab had time to make home movies, but S.H.I.E.L.D.'s surveillance was ever-present. Jarvis put together a montage of footage from several scenes over the years before they pulled up stakes and moved to London...

On their first Christmas in Puente Antiguo, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s archives recorded Darcy (nee Lewis) Stark, decked out head to toe in blue and silver knitwear. A blue Santa hat perched on her head and she wore long, looping strands of silver pom-pom trim around her neck in the style of a scarf. Her hands kept busy as she watched the readout on an overhead monitor and called out pertinent numbers to her boss while she rigged up lights around a stationary Dr. Selvig, himself reading data from a second monitor.

In the next clip, Darcy bellowed Christmas carols, seated on her desk in the lab beside Barton, until Jane surfaced from the depths of SCIENCE! for Chinese takeout and cookies baked by Darcy in the lab's tiny toaster oven, using store-bought dough. The S.H.I.E.L.D. team were included, too, happily munching on cookies while they were still hot, despite everyone griping about how bitter the red ones tasted. (Darcy scribbled the brand name of the red ones off of her weekly shopping list.)

In the next scene, she wrapped a hand-knitted scarf at least four times longer than it needed to be around Jane's head and neck up to her eyeballs, and kissed her on the nose. ""Thanks for taking a chance on me, boss-lady.""

Jane's lips trembled as she tried not to smile and repeated her standard line, ""You were the only applicant.""

""We both know that's a li-ie..."" Darcy sang to the tune of some mystery, modern Christmas carol.

Jane sat in silence, refusing to rise to Darcy's bait, but slightly inebriated Darcy wasn't done yet. ""You think I don't know you know what you did without thinking I knew."" She stopped and traced back over that sentence, then nodded once in certainty before carrying on, ""Somehow, you found out I got turned down for all the other internships I applied for and that I needed an internship this year to finish before my scholarship and housing runs out.""

Foster started to protest, but found her lips smooshed by Darcy's thumb and forefinger. ""No! Don't tell me how you knew. Just ... eat some cookies, Foster.""

Jane ate the cookies.

The film jumped again, this time to the rooftop of the car dealership serving as Foster's desert laboratory. The buildings in the background all appeared to be of new construction or recently renovated, so this must have happened in the year or two after Thor departed Earth the first time.

On the roof, as the dusky blanket of twilight descended over a desolate horizon, Darcy swayed in Clint's arms to the tinny sound of a distant radio's Christmas music. The soft glow of multicolored lights and neon from the surrounding buildings provided an almost-romantic backdrop for what could have been a rooftop date, if the viewer didn't know both parties better.

Clint, arms full of octopus!Darcy, tried with limited success to pull her back from the choice view at the edge and her favorite spot to sit.

""I'm not dancing with--I'm half-dancing but... Dancing is nice,"" Darcy's words were garbled, face pressed into Clint's shoulder.

""Ordinarily, I would agree, but you're dancing drunk on the roof alone while your boss pines and thinks universe-bending thoughts in the desert, also alone. Only one of you is drunk and it's the one most likely to plummet to her death unsupervised. Please, let me take you home, Darce?""

He tried to boost her up over his shoulder in a fireman's carry, but she was wily and uncooperative to the end. ""You're not the boss of me, Agent Chicken Bok-bok."" She poked his butt cheek and snorted under layers of hair and scarf and sweater.

""No, I'm not the boss of you, but I'm your friend, no matter what shitty names you call me, and I'm taking you down to the trailer and tucking you in before you live to regret all sorts of terrible decisions.""

""You're okay, Errol."" Darcy planted a sloppy kiss on his back and Clint laughed.

""We'll see if you still feel that way tomorrow morning, or if I'm back to being Jackbooted Thug Numero Uno again.""

""Aww... Don't pout, Chicken Little."" She patted his butt affectionately. ""You're my favorite jackbooted life-butter-inner.""

""Come on, kiddo. Let's get you home.""

""Wait, wait,"" she insisted, wiggling and bucking until he set her down. She ran to the center of the rooftop to snatch up something from the edge of their fire ring. Tilting her head up to the night sky, she called out, ""Merry Christmas, Heimdall! Merry Christmas, Thor!"" before turning to Barton. ""You think he's okay up there?""

Clint shrugged. ""Probably more okay up there than down here.""

""I mean..."" She wandered in tight circles, staring up at the heavens, mouth agape. ""He was only here for, like, a minute and a half and he got hit by the same car twice.""

""Your car.""

""Jane's car."" She snapped to a sloppy sort of attention with a finger on Clint's nose.

""You were driving,"" he mumbled around her pressing finger.

""Once, and Jane jerked the wheel. I maintain that she was in control of the vehicle both times she ran down a Norse god with the Pinz.""

""Moot point, anyway,"" Clint insisted. ""He got better.""

""Yeah."" Darcy's features softened and she returned her gaze to the sky. ""I wonder what Christmas is like up there. Is it homey? Like in those Norman Rockwell paintings, or is it something completely alien? All of it's alien, I guess.""

Her voice took on a dreamy quality as she wondered aloud, but Clint was looking up now, too, and remarked, ""It's all alien to me. Wouldn't know a normal, homey Christmas if it bit me in the ass.""

""Yeah, same,"" Darcy replied, sounding a million miles away.

""It's been better since Nat came along. Me and her, and sometimes, Phil. You could come home with me this year, Darce. I'll assign a pair of agents to Foster so she can lay out in the desert and think her deep thoughts, and you could come home with me to Bed-Stuy. Christmas with me and Nat could be fun. We're no Norman Rockwell, but we can make up our own normal.""

Their eyes met as the sun sank below the horizon and Darcy whispered, ""I'd like that. Thanks.""

""Anytime, Darce.""

Clint wrapped an arm around her waist and guided her to the new safety stairs installed by S.H.I.E.L.D. where Selvig stood, waiting, with a warm jacket and eyes filled with fatherly concern, but Darcy was already leaning heavily on Clint, relying on him to guide her safely downstairs. He swept her up in a secure cradle hold as Selvig made way, but the elder doctor's words could clearly be heard as they descended. ""It's settled then? She's going home with you for the holidays? I'll see to Jane, but Darcy hasn't anyone that we know of, and she wouldn't hear of coming with us, for some reason...""

""She shared the spare room with Nat,"" Clint murmured as the scene on screen faded to black. ""Should've seen her face on Christmas morning, a pile of halfass-wrapped presents under the tree with her name on most of 'em and a stack of rubbery pancakes for breakfast. You'd'a thought it was her first Christmas morning.""

Tony's Adam's apple bobbed as he struggled for words. ""It probably was, Clint."" A tear spilled over dark lashes, falling into tiny Darcy's curls. ""Whenever she talks about Christmas and family traditions, she talks about that Christmas, and the one after, too, I guess, when you two visited her in London."" He met the archer's eyes over Pepper's head. ""Thanks.""

Clint nodded, head bowed over his bowl of popcorn, swallowing hard against the lump in his throat.

""Another home movie?"" Jarvis asked quietly, but no one could do more than nod and swallow and blink until the next Christmas scene faded in.

 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

Bruce, Hulk, and Sam celebrate Christmas through the years. Sam and Steve receive a surprise this Christmas no one was expecting.

Still with me? Buckle up for the long haul, my BBs.

The face of a young Bruce Banner lit up the screen next, a series of reserved still photos from long ago Christmases with his Aunt Susan.

""Christmas ... was a difficult time. My aunt understood that and kept things pretty low-key,"" Bruce murmured, leaning over the back of the couch by Tony's head. The others had pulled out the enormous sofa bed and rearranged the cushions to make one big chaise lounge for the group to crash on during the slide show. Reticent as ever, Bruce opted to pull up a chair from the nearest game table to sit near the rest of the team and their families with a clear path to the door, just in case.

Tony stretched backward to press a noisy kiss to Bruce's cheek. ""Glad you decided to stick it out with us this year. Hulk would have missed out on giant snowball ice hockey with the kids.""

A small, serene smile came to the fore. Bruce reminded his friend, ""I thought we were calling it Ice Hulkey.""

""Yeah, that. We'll get jerseys made, make it an annual thing,"" Tony played along, tapping out notes about Hulkey jerseys, and a few other ideas to go over with Jarvis later.

The ever-ready A.I. queued up the next video, one of Hulk, celebrating his first Christmas with Tony and Pepper at the tower. In the video, Tony climbed onto a chair to set a big, bright Santa hat with a jingle bell on Hulk's head. With infinite patience, Pepper waited nearby, holding a giant candy cane to surprise the big guy.

Hulk's eyes widened in surprise when she offered him the candy. ""FOR HULK?""

""Yes."" Pepper tugged him down by the wrist to press a kiss to his cheek. ""Merry Christmas, Hulk.""

""MERRY ... KISSMAS ... PEP.""

Hulk grinned at Tony and the engineer's face lit up. ""Close enough, Big Green. How about a Christmas movie? Hmm... Maybe A Charlie Brown Christmas. Everybody should see that at least once.""

""CHARLIE BROWN DOG, SNOOPY.""

""Yeah! Just like the Red Baron cartoon we watched the other day!"" Tony led Hulk around the craters in the penthouse floor (Hulks' favorite part of the penthouse; Tony would bronze the floor, if Pep let him) to settle on the giant bean bag chair Pepper found for Big Green to use when he made a surprise visit.

The home movie on screen faded to black before a multimedia slideshow of still photos and video began, all of Sam and the Wilson family; his parents Paul and Darlene, and Sam and his three older sisters. Images of snowboarding and tubing in the Poconos on school trips and hiking through the woods to an old tree farm Paul loved from his childhood in the mountains. A teenage Sam rolled his eyes, arguing with his dad over who would have to lay down on the cold ground to cut down the tree.

""Seems like a fine choice to me. Time for you to learn how this is done, kid."" Paul held out the saw to the young Sam on screen, but when Sam was on his back, hacking away at the undergrowth to get to the sap-soaked trunk, Paul gave the whole tree a good shake, sending boughfuls of snow cascading to the ground in an avalanche of powdery snow and pine.

""Just checking!"" Paul cackled as Sam sputtered mouthfuls of old snow and pine needles. ""Never know when you're gonna pick the wrong one and end up with a house full of baby praying mantises or an angry squirrel or some such!""

""Thanks, Dad,"" Sam's resigned voice drifted up through the fresh snowbank.

At Camp Stark, grown-up Sam's friends laughed.

""Man, Wilson, I thought it was a legit superhero curse, coming from all of our screwed up backgrounds and families, but you're so  normal."" Barton's lip curled in surprise.

Sam grimaced and arched an eyebrow. ""Thanks, I guess.""

On screen, yet another slideshow started, this one of the more unusual of Sam's Christmases. In the background, surrounded by a dark tent and beige everything, sat a tiny, fake Christmas tree covered in dangling hemostats with a pathetic garland of medical gauze that had seen better days. A pair of old desert-issue, combat boots sat on the floor beneath, each one marked with Sharpie to indicate which was for ""Sam"" and the other for ""Riley"". In the foreground, Sam posed with his arm slung around his best friend, pale as the day is long, with red hair and and a riot of freckles. Between them, they held up a small sign that read, ""We'll be home before next Christmas, Moms"".

""Shit,"" Sam cursed. ""Jarvis, where'd you get that photo?""

""Retired Army Nurse, Lieutenant Colonel Darlene Wilson submitted the photo by email when a request for Initiative families' photos was sent out before the holidays. It also arrived with an audio file. Would you like me to play that as well, Senior Airman Wilson?""

Sam rolled his eyes. ""No need to be so formal, Jarvis. I'm not upset with you. Go ahead and play Mama's message.""

On the recording, a standalone microphone crackled to life, ""I've got it, Paul. I know how the damn thing works. You can do your own in a minute here. Now, shoo."" Footsteps padded out of range in the background. ""Sammy, now, honey, I know you've got yourself some unusual kindergarten-aged circumstances up there at Tony Stark's Home for Misfit Superheroes this month and all, but that's no excuse for not bringing my boy, Steven, and that adorable little one of his on down here where I can spoil them both right with cookies and cocoa and presents. Your father was all set to build a new tree fort for the little fellow, too, you know. Broke his heart, you did, Sammy. Do you have any idea what it's like, watching the holidays come and go, wondering where your child is and if he's well or warm or safe? NO, YOU DO NOT. So we're expecting you and all the rest of your superhero friends for Sunday dinner soon. Don't make me wait, Sammy. If you're in no hurry to give me grandbabies before I shuffle off this mortal coil, least you could do is let me spoil your friends and their babies. Your sisters said to tell you hello--well, they would have, if anyone bothered coming home for Christmas this year, but off they go with their husbands and babies and here are your father and I, alone in our old age, not a single grateful child come home to roost for the holidays, now you don't need us anymore--""

""That's enough, Jarvis,"" Sam's dry voice cut off his mother's pining rant. He looked at Steve. ""You heard her. At least fifty percent of this is your problem, Captain You-must-be-Sam's-younger-aunt-because-you're-too-young-to-be-his-mother-ma'am.""

Steve nodded and tried to hide his laughter. ""I'll call her tomorrow, set something up with the advance security team for next Sunday.""

""No need, Captain Rogers,"" Jarvis cut into the conversation. ""Arrangements were made when Lieutenant Colonel Wilson's audio message was received. Pastor Paul and Lieutenant Colonel Darlene Wilson are scheduled to arrive at the Camp Stark airstrip in eleven minutes and counting. Director Hill has offered to accompany them to the lodge herself.""

""Man,"" Sam sighed and shook his head at Steve, ""are you in for it now.""

When you're all caught up here, go check out the brand new prequel, All I Ever Wanted, the story of how Tony and Darcy became family.

 

 This story/series is NOT on hiatus. I've been posting pre-written updates to the series for a few months now. Real life has been a huge struggle for me this year. It's hard to write humor when your anxiety keeps you from sleeping because your husband is sick, you know? I've been posting some of the things I had pre-written and I plan to come back to this story soon, but demanding updates from me or any other author in the comments section is still really, incredibly rude. Please don't do it. No amount of readers demanding more free entertainment from me is going to will away my anxiety or my husband's new diabetes diagnosis. I love this story. I will write more. When I can. Want to be encouraging? Awesome. I will love you for it forever, but don't harrass me for updates in the comments section, no matter how polite you think you're being. Especially while I'm actively posting additional content in this series frequently. 

Long before they became kids again, Bucky flirted with Darcy; Darcy flirted back.

I'M BA-ACK. (^_^)

MASSIVE THANKS go to Inkbert for all her help working out the kinks in this story and update until I managed to find my way again. Way back in the spring, she went over the details with me and let me bounce around ideas until I sorted out everything I want to do in this story's future in my head and on paper. Be sure to check out her fics and leave her some love, too, if you'd like to find a way to thank her!

TRIGGER WARNING for the briefest of mentions of suicidal ideation for a scene added after this chapter was originally posted. Please take care of yourself first. If this is a mention that is not good for your mental health, I'm happy to summarize the chapter for you, so you don't miss anything.

While they waited for Sam's parents to arrive and join the party, the next video flickered to life like an old 8mm film as Jarvis explained, ""The video clips in this montage span a range of holidays and events significant to Miss Stark and Master Barnes before their age regression. All have been marked for review as part of the NASA collaboration project with the Avengers Initiative.""

""NASA-what now?"" someone murmured.

""NASA's been recruiting--  wooing  Darcy,"" Tony's best friend explained. Rhodey glanced quickly around the room for reactions before continuing, ""Since Greenwich, NASA and the Air Force have been feeling out Darcy's relationship with Asgard through Thor, looking for an inside man ... or woman, in this case. Without consent from Asgard to film wherever she travels by Bifrost, Darcy would only agree to appear on a documentary-style show on Earth with Thor for the time being, as part of a collaboration between the Avengers Initiative and NASA. She's been reviewing security and social media footage for months, looking for tidbits of everyday life for a 'normal' working behind the scenes with the Avengers. The documentary will use the sourced video mostly as B-roll footage after filming for the pilot begins, if it ever resumes production, since its primary star is a five year old now."" He grinned widely and settled in, arms stretched across the back of the sofa, nodding in thanks when Sharon passed over a bowl of popcorn. ""I'm curious what all she turned up in the Starkives before the accident.""

On screen, Tony watched as Barnes, grown and grizzled, looking every bit the worse for wear, reclined on the tiled floor of the tower's solarium in a puddle of sunlight like a well-fed housecat finally coaxed in from the cold to warm his bones through the winter months. Propped up on his elbows, knees bent, face canted to follow the sun's path across the sky, Barnes looked like a man without a care in the world, but everyone watching the artfully edited security footage knew the soldier to be every bit as aware of his environment as he would have been with eyes open, upright and fully alert.

An arc-powered Osprey branded with Stark Industries imagery landed in the background, depositing adult Darcy onto the wide, flight deck on the roof. Smiling and unhurried, she gathered up wind-blown curls into a messy knot atop her head, grabbed the crate by her feet in the passenger area, and skipped down the gangway with a shout of thanks to the co-pilots over her shoulder. When her feet touched the roof, the ramp slid back into place and the Osprey moved silently on to its next secure destination.

Tony couldn't help but grin. In the months after the Convergence, Darcy and Foster came and went frequently from the tower, making good use of the lab facilities Pepper arranged for their team in the states, crashing in their stateside, tower apartment for a day or two, before inevitably hurrying off to the next science nerd confab or satellite array or agency briefing or weekend away on Asgard.

Portal tech intel became the new field in which every agency needed an expert overnight. Foster and Darcy were happy to provide them with the know-how to potentially close a portal and little more, backed up in that decision by Stark Industries and fully supported in their endeavors by Stark security and Thor's looming presence in the background of all such discussions.

Pepper and Thor did not fuck around with their safety.

Darcy made frequent jaunts across the pond, commuting between continents two to three times each week to attend classes for which Colombia couldn't provide a telecommuting option. Some days, Tony remembered, she looked worn to the bone. He'd wheedle and cajole, finally imploring Pepper to intervene with some excuse for the kid to stick around through the weekend to rest up. Then the two of them would convince her to take her books and gear down to the townhouse on Fifth, enjoy the shallow lounging pool deck, maybe order up service from the kitchens or enjoy a meal from a lunch truck provided by SI, parked across the street by the curb at Central Park--whatever her heart desired, as long as she'd sit her exhausted ass down somewhere quiet for a day or two to study and rest before making the run across the Atlantic again to babysit Foster and Thor in the pursuit of more dimension-bending science.

To say nothing of the constant demands and occasionally more polite requests for a meeting, once a government lackey overheard Thor call Darcy his sister. A sister by choice, but saying so made her every bit as legal a daughter of Odin on Asgard as the adoption papers made her a Stark on Earth.

On the roof that day, more than a year before her age regression, she wore her typical, student uniform best suited to Greenwich weather: a long, fitted sweater over skinny jeans with rain boots. Even here, Pepper had her own small way. After weeks of arguing back and forth following Darcy's acquiescence to take an apartment (to make Tony happy) when she commuted for school, Tony's lady love insisted Darcy was all but family anyway and Pepper's stylist would love the challenge of dressing a student like Darcy with so many unique responsibilities and roles to fill in a single week.

Pepper got her way.

Darcy ended up with a designer suitcase full of things she might not actually freeze to death in out in the desert or in the middle of Siberia, chasing cosmic tornadoes.

And Tony got to treat the young woman he already thought of as his daughter of choice as his daughter  in fact .

She looked more like a Stark disembarking the jet than Tony had ever managed in his forty-five years.

Her sweater was Missoni, worn over Balmain motocross jeans. The dark cherry leather jacket was a custom piece from Pepper's in-house Stark-label designer. Burberry rainboots in a classic pattern and color chosen by Pepper didn't even squeak.

Still, Barnes noticed.

Silent, his eyes slitted open as Darcy handed off the crate to a porter, happy to let someone else do the heavy lifting for once. He watched the gentle sway of her hips, the careless way she flicked a stray curl over her shoulder, the easy smile she shared with the porter, until they both disappeared behind the reflective glass door on the far side of the roof.

More moments like the first one caught on film followed. Jarvis, always sensitive to Tony's preferences, slowly mixed in a soundtrack to play with the clip montage.

...Darcy in a dark green fitted sweater and skinny jeans, twirling through Tony's workshop, red-cheeked and wind-mussed, dancing on tip-toe in her rain boots and chattering about a professor's impressed response to her latest paper.

...Wide-eyed, grinning maniacally, Darcy clung to Thor, squealing with a joyful kind of terror as he swung Mjolnir and darted skyward, a secure arm around his shield-sister.

...Darcy, laughing, clinging to Clint's back like a spider monkey in faded jeans, battered blue Chucks, and yet another sweater as he galloped through Conference Room A during a meeting with Zombie Fury, right on time. Clint, Darcy, and Tony spilled out of the conference room, sweeping the party of Avengers and agents in the hallway along with them to the nearest balcony for some sunshine, burgers, and beer.

""There She Goes"" by The La's tied Jarvis' montage together as Barnes cast furtive glances her way from behind shaggy hair time and again.

...Barnes stalking through a doorway, headed to the one quiet space on the medbay floor guaranteed to give him a moment of peace on his difficult days, the afternoons when he worked with the shrinks, when Tony once overheard him admit to Steve it sometimes felt like his skin was too tight, like the vastness of his awful experiences and extended lifespan were more than he could bear, like he wanted to end it all.

But Darcy was there instead of echoing loneliness, waiting for him in the stairwell with a pair of ice cream cones. 

""Clint said Monday and Thursday afternoons can be kind of rough for you."" She rolled her lips and offered him the second soft serve twist as Jarvis made the segue from The La's to Omi's ""Cheerleader"" over the sound system. ""Ice cream always makes me feel a little better.""

Smiling through suddenly watery eyes, Barnes dropped to the top step beside Darcy and accepted the ice cream with a rough, ""Thanks.""

Darcy tipped her head against his metal arm like it was already old hat. ""Wanna put on some ugly PJs and veg for a few hours? I love The Muppet Movie when I need a pick me up.""

""What's a muppet?""

Darcy's laugh tinkled lightly in the echoing stairwell. ""Come on. I'll show you. Tony probably has the whole series streaming on StarkTV. And I guarantee Clint left some sweats you could borrow in my apartment after that 4th of July thing with the hot tub and the dive-bombing pigeons. Did you hear he rappelled from the roof all the way down to my balcony just to get away from his tiny bird bros?"" She giggled as Barnes helped her to her feet and followed where she led. 

The screen darkened and, subtly, the music pouring through the speakers transitioned to the opening violin strings of ""Rather Be"" by Clean Bandit as a new video began to play.

...Finally, Darcy blew through the common room in a pencil skirt, ass-kicking Louboutins (courtesy of Pepper's bottomless closet), and seamed stockings that went all the way up to her eyeballs.

Barnes leaned out of his seat to watch her wiggle until she disappeared through the double doors to the Avengers-level lobby.

""See somethin' you like there, Buck?"" Captain Upright Citizen asked, eyes on his hand of cards while he waited for Natasha to take her turn.

The soldier hitched a shoulder and smirked, ""No harm lookin' at a swell dame with a pretty pair'a stems, is there?""

Looking wasn't all he did.

The next video clip to fade in came up in black and white--surveillance footage from the mansion taken later that same day, or possibly another day when she wore something similar. The footage toggled from one camera to the next, following Darcy's progress as she moved through the Starkives in the basement of the mansion. Well lit, warm and inviting, like a really opulent private school library, the Starkives were designed to draw visitors in to enjoy the wealth of family history stored there, to encourage one to pull out family albums and reminisce over drinks in the well-appointed lounge and bar area. From time to time, Darcy headed down there to study to get away from the mansion's many luxurious distractions, so it was with some surprise that her shoulders suddenly tensed on screen. She glanced down a row of bookcases, smiled, and shook her head.

Then Tony spotted what caught Darcy's attention down the row. A certain sure-footed, former assassin browsed the ancient tomes in the next aisle over, occasionally finding an excuse to walk past Darcy's aisle. They played their version of peekaboo a few more times before she huffed, rolled her eyes, and turned as if to call out, but Barnes was gone. Slack with disappointment, Darcy's shoulders sagged. She turned to put the folio of papers she'd been idly thumbing through back on the shelf, then jumped and screamed bloody murder.

In the rec room at Camp Stark, everyone watching the video startled, too, hot popcorn scattering in a buttery shower from more than one upturned bowl.

""What on Earth?"" Pepper gasped, flinching so hard Bucky grunted and rolled across her legs to sprawl half-across Darcy's tiny, limp form.

Another toggle of the camera view showed Barnes, grinning sheepishly at Darcy over the books through the bookcase from the next aisle, but Darcy, clearly not expecting him to be  right there , lost her footing. Before her arms had a chance to windmill for balance, Barnes was by her side, an arm around her waist, steadying the bookcase, keeping a decade of family history and Darcy from all going down like dominoes.

""Sorry, doll,"" he apologized, looking sincerely contrite. ""Forgot to make noise so you'd know where to look for me.""

Weak with unspent hysteria, she pressed her forehead to his shoulder. ""Forgiven. Just ... next time, maybe don't do that.""

Barnes stifled a laugh and tightened the arm around her waist. ""Sure thing.""

""You owe me a drink,"" she warned. ""The biggest drink with a tiny umbrella the size of my head.""

""How can a tiny--""

""Okay, Barnes, you twisted my arm--make it a  drink  the size of my head."" She thumped the back of his shoulder and tipped her chin up. ""A drink you're buying at lunch with me today.""

Barnes' smiled dropped. ""I ain't cleared for goin' out anywhere beyond the tower or any'a the properties monitored by Jarvis yet. Couldn't even take a walk in the sunshine to come down here. Had to ride Howard's idea of a subway to get this far. 'Sides which, you prob'ly don' wanna be seen with me, doll. Bein' who you are.""

""Being who I am...?"" Darcy's brow furrowed as she parsed his words.

""A Stark, big deal heiress an' all,"" Barnes tried to fill in the gaps, but Darcy wasn't having it.

""I'm not--not really."" She clasped his elbows, running a soothing pattern up the backs of his arms. ""Tony's all bluster. He's always talking about adopting me. It's noise, really. Everyone in the tower is his family.""

Which was bullshit and she knew it. Tony had no interest in adopting Thor or Foster, that was for damn sure.

""Pepper says you're taking meetings on behalf of Asgard.""

Darcy stilled. Twisting to set the files at her elbow aright, she fussed for a moment, then asked without making eye contact, ""She told you about that?""

""I asked her about a job--earn my keep instead'a spongin' off'a Stevie, you know? The shrinks okayed me for passive work with my skillset for now, runnin' ops from the control room at the tower, working light, low-stress security gigs, going quietly further out of my head at the tower..."" Barnes snorted, disgusted. ""Pepper said she'd like someone from the Initiative to sit in with you, lend the appearance of muscle backing you up so none'a those slick lobbyists tries to push you around when Thor can't back you up to stare them down himself.""

""Nobody pushes me around."" Darcy flashed the device she carried at all times: a taser masquerading as a Sonic Screwdriver replica. (""You built me a Sonic Screwdriver?"" ""Well, yeah, but that's trademarked, so ... let's call it not-that."" He flipped it over and pointed out the features like the showman he was, come down through the blood. ""With built-in, psychic cloaking tech, so it can't be seen by sticky-fingered, jack-booted thugs when you need it most. Or in case of marauding elves or fire-breathing death mechas or more blond bros falling from the sky."" ""Thanks, Tony!"") ""But that's cool,"" Darcy continued, ""you volunteered for that gig? Following me around D.C.?""

Barnes chuckled. ""Doll, I'm the only one Tony didn't immediately run off when he found out who'd be on your security detail.""

The Christmas Eve slideshow comes to an end with tears, answers, and more questions.

You guys... I can't tell you how much it means to me that you're still here for this story. 

There are a few things you should know about this chapter (and the one before it):

1. There was a scene I meant to write as part of the previous chapter and it somehow got lost in my notes over the past year. I've since added it, so go back and reread that chapter for a sweet, tender bonus flashback scene between grownup Darcy and Bucky, if you've got a moment.2. This chapter is the chapter. The one I've been struggling with and running away from for a year because I am emotionally stunted and socially awkward, and feelings are hard af to write, but even harder with my anxiety. I finally got it done. I can only hope it was worth the wait.3. Fuck canon.4. Srsly, tho, for real, fuck. canon. in. the. ear.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

The screen remained dark as the next video began to play while voices Steve would know anywhere snickered and cracked bawdy jokes under their breath. Someone finally had the presence of mind to aim the camera in a direction with enough ambient lighting to pick up the door they stood outside with their ears pressed to it, listening.

The door to Steve's quarters at the SSR base in London, a week before Christmas, 1944.

""Jarvis, pause the video,"" Steve hissed, trying to sit up without disturbing the sleeping six year old spread across his lap and Tony's (and Darcy's). Dragging in a shaking breath, he ran a hand over his forehead and eyes, and exhaled an equally shaky breath. ""Where did you get this video, Jarvis?""

The AI took a moment to collate his answers and replied, ""The original eight-millimeter film reel has been stored in the Starkives at the Stark family home on Fifth Avenue since the year 1946 as part of a project to collect all relevant public, professional, and personal details regarding the Howling Commandos strike team and their supervising officer, Major General Steven Grant Rogers, details the Howling Commandos, lead by former Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Margaret Elizabeth Mary Carter, deemed 'CLASSIFIED - EYES ONLY' after the loss of Sergeant Major James Buchanan Barnes and the disappearance of Major General Steven Grant Rogers. Copies of the film were created and retained by all surviving members of the Howling Commandos strike team and former Director Carter. Retired Majors Dugan and Jones, Director Carter, and Colonel Morita all submitted copies of the home movie when an email was directed to relevant parties in search of holiday home movies and photos for tonight's slide show, as well as the NASA-Avengers Initiative collaboration project young Miss Stark agreed to star in before her regression to age five last month.""

Steve growled. ""Remove it from the collection of B-roll footage for NASA's reality show. Tag it 'personal use only' from today forward, no matter who submits it for consideration of public viewing, unless you hear otherwise from myself or former Director Carter,"" he growled, then added under his breath, ""Interfering assholes.""

Beside him, Tony closed his eyes, choking, trying to stifle a laugh.

""You've seen it?"" Steve asked his teammate and friend.

""No."" Tony shook his head. ""I've heard about it. Dad was experimenting with portable, handheld movie cameras years before anyone else. I heard the Commandos had access to a prototype and made some of the earliest known home videos. Holiday footage from the prototype experiment is sometimes requested from the Starkives for use alongside the newsreel films in the Smithsonian exhibit and in a few of the documentaries focused on the personal lives of the Commandos over the years, but most of those were loaned directly from the Commandos' personal collections to keep control of the footage in their hands. I've never handed over any of those films without the Commandos' okay. Same goes for Dad, as far as I know."" He nodded at the screen. ""No one has ever shared this one, though, for obvious reasons.""

""Steve?"" Nat laid a hand on his knee and waited.

""Christmas week of 'forty-four,"" he said under his breath. Her hand tightened on his knee, but she gave no indication to the others she knew what he meant.

But she knew. He told her himself after D.C., when they both laid all their cards on the table: no more secrets, so nothing could come between them when they wiped the slate clean and started looking for Bucky, together.

Taking a deep, steadying breath, Steve considered whether his friends needed to know this most personal thing he'd kept from everyone but Nat, or if he'd done them a disservice in not starting on a clean slate with all of them, too. He closed his eyes and concentrated on the feel of Nat's hand on his knee, the firm, but gentle pressure, the delicate pulse of her wrist through his jeans, remembering the way she'd climbed into his lap and kissed him breathless when he told her everything, through tears and regrets, and so much anger about everything he'd lost.

""Play the video, Jarvis,"" he whispered, letting Tony take all of Bucky's weight from his lap so his arms were empty when Natasha burrowed into them and turned her face alongside his to watch the home movie footage Steve hadn't seen since it was developed in early January, 1945.

On screen, someone shouldered the door open after a cursory knock. In a slim, single officer's cot, lay Steve wrapped around Peggy, thankfully both covered modestly with an OD green blanket and the army's itchy sheets. Peggy's hand tangled with Steve's on top of the covers, displaying the glittering icy white of her engagement ring like the sparkle of freshly fallen snow in the sunshine.

The camera panned to show the Commandos, lined up with trash can lids, tin cans from the mess, a bugle, and even a pair of cowbells. Falsworth raised his hand and brought it down, signaling the others to--


 CRASH! 



 BANGBANGBANG! 



 DONG-DONG-DONG! 


""Congratulations!"", ""Wakey-wakey!"", ""Felicitations!"", came the resounding congratulatory chorus all at once, on top of each other, the way the Commandos seemed to do everything.

Steve startled awake and rolled off the backside of the bed, coming up with both Lugers he confiscated on the raid earlier that week and a knife between his teeth, while Peggy sat up, cool as you please, pulling the sidearm from beneath their shared pillow and leveling it at Dugan with his cacophonous trashcan lids.

""I will kill you, Sgt. Dugan, so dead, your mother won't recognize what's left, if you don't cease that infernal racket,"" she uttered just as calmly, pressing the covers firmly over her breasts, though her hair was its usual messy tangle in the morning and pillow creases lined her pinkened cheek on one side.

""Congratulations?"" He smiled impishly, but shifted his hold to shield himself with his can lids.

""Dernier, I suppose I have your trading skill to thank for this champagne hangover."" She nodded regally, but Steve saw the pained wince behind her eyes.

""Aw, sweetheart,"" his past self said on film, setting aside his weapons and wrapping a spare blanket around his middle before rising to lean over the bed and place a hand on her neck to check her wellbeing like his ma used to do. ""Why didn't you say so? I'll get you some aspirin.""

""I was asleep, darling, but now I'm awake, I'll take that aspirin ... after you show out this noisy rabble."" She motioned toward the door with her sidearm, then squinted at one of the fellas. ""That better not be Howard's portable film camera I see.""

""Uh, no ma'am,"" Jones and Morita chorused, tucking the thing down low between them, but letting it continue to run.

""I better not see that on movie night,"" Peggy grumbled. ""Or I  will  know who to come for.""

A hurried collection of ""yes, ma'am""s followed.

""Aw, Carter, we only meant ta bring ya a proper engagement breakfast, doll. No need ta throw us out and threaten the kids,"" Bucky drawled, leaning heavily on the Brooklyn in his words. From the hallway, he retrieved a picnic basket as the other Commandos filed out. Someone set the camera by the door, still rolling. ""There's a thermos of tea, real eggs, toast, mushrooms, beans, hash browns, bacon, black pudding, and sausages enough to feed you and your personal, one-man army there."" He nodded at his best friend with a smile.

""Thanks, Buck."" Steve nodded at the thing hanging unspoken between them--the  ""I'm so happy for you, pal."" 

""Yes, thank you, Sergeant,"" Peggy dredged up a soft, pained expression of gratitude.

Bucky pulled a packet of aspirin out of his pocket from the base exchange. He set it on the nightstand by Peggy's elbow, pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead, and murmured, ""There's a canteen full'a fresh water in the basket, too. Congratulations, sweetheart."" Then, he grabbed the portable camera left behind by one of the others and closed the door in his wake.

At Camp Stark, before anyone had a chance to turn to Steve, eyes full of questions, the scene changed on screen.

""Big day, pal,"" Howard's voice startled Steve from the speakers in the corners of the room. The camera was aimed at Peggy, sitting before a dressing table somewhere in the basement of the London SSR chapel.

Peggy murmured in return, ""A day like any other, really."" She clucked in typical British disapproval, ""All this fuss... People get married every day.""

""It's not every day someone marries Captain America, though."" Howard tipped the movie camera up at the mirror over her shoulder and smiled his toothy grin behind the bulky handheld. ""It'll be the biggest thing to happen since the start of the war. It'll give people hope, Pegs.""

""I'm not marrying Captain America."" She swatted him away from her shoulder. ""I'm marrying Steven Rogers."" She turned when the door opened and Falsworth's head popped in.

""It's time,"" her countryman announced.

She closed her eyes and exhaled, the only show of emotion she'd likely allow herself on Howard's film.

The film cut away to the scene in the chapel nave, every inch of it decorated in boughs of evergreen and hollyberries, with tissue paper angels and snowflakes made by London schoolchildren for the special occasion fluttering in the draft caused by a door opening in the narthex. Howard sat at the front on the bride's side, beside her only cousin from London, a distant relation who only agreed to attend when he heard  who  Peggy would marry that evening. The fella mugged for the War Department's film crews and for Howard himself, until Howard elbowed him and told him to mind his Ps and Qs.

At the altar, Steve waited for Peggy, Bucky grinning ear to ear by his side, as Falsworth escorted the bride in her SSR mess dress whites down the aisle to a recording of the Wedding March, not a curl out of place, lips painted her favorite fire engine red. Everyone rose to their feet and Howard cursed under his breath, ""Hot damn, Peg, you'll melt the fella's buttons right off.""

Steve, who opted to wear the SSR mess dress blacks, waited for his bride at the altar with Bucky's hand on his shoulder--the only thing that likely kept him from running down the aisle to meet her halfway.

""Who gives this woman to this man in marriage?"" Col. Phillips asked.

""On behalf of a proud nation and its allies,"" Falsworth's voice boomed for the benefit of the War Department microphones and cameras (At least three of Steve's men, sitting on the groom's side, rolled their eyes.), ""I present this woman, Margaret Elizabeth Mary Carter, Agent of the Strategic Scientific Reserve, to Steven Grant Rogers, Captain America of the United States Armed Forces and Agent of the Strategic Scientific Reserve.""

In the rec pavilion back at Camp Stark, Steve hungrily devoured all the small details: Peg's seamed stockings and sturdy pumps, paired with her formal whites; that same scuffed left toe on her service shoes, tidied with a bit of polish; the way Falsworth fumbled the Christmassy bouquet of holly and evergreens, and swore ripely when Peggy handed it off, drawing catcalls from the Commandos until Phillips turned a beady eye on the assembly and they quieted to a dull roar; the way the light from the altar candles shone off the pomade in his and Bucky's hair; the sweet curl smoothed and pinned in front of Peggy's ear that his fingers itched to play with all through the ceremony. Before he knew it, the couple on screen were saying their vows.

And then the worst part, the one thing they both agreed needed to be said, the nod to the war, the understanding that the worst could happen and they were prepared for that duty, too, even while pledging themselves to one another.

""And I solemnly swear, if the worst should come to pass,"" Peggy sniffled, fingers shaking in Steve's as she made this, her final vow, ""I  will  carry on to honor your wishes, life, and sacrifice by living my own life to the fullest today and every day from this day forward, not only in sickness and in health, but together or parted, always honoring my love and respect for you, my beloved husband.""

Steve's vision blurred, listening to his younger, more naive self promising the same.

""Steve,"" Nat whispered.

He shook his head, biting his lip as a tear escaped.

""Excuse us,"" she told the others, dragging Steve to the door.

Before they made it out into the biting cold night air, Steve heard a tiny, sleepy voice whisper to Tony, ""Can a colonel really marry people?""

""Yes,"" came the expected answer.

""So Uncle Rhodey could marry you and Mommy?""

Someone snickered, but Tony must have nodded because Bucky suddenly came halfway to life, posing the next logical question in a child's mind: ""And Thteebie and Nat, too?"" he asked slyly.

Natasha followed Steve around the back of the building, settling by his side when he sat on the deck between two unfinished railing posts, feet dangling over the water.

""I just need a minute,"" he rasped, temporarily obscuring his face with a puff of condensation in the cold night air.

""We can take all the time you need,"" she assured him, leaning into his side for warmth and wrapping an arm around his back as his arm fell across her shoulders and pulled her close.

When his phone pinged with an incoming text, Nat hid her smile against his ribs. He grunted in annoyance, but checked his phone to make sure it wasn't an emergency.

""It's Peggy,"" Steve answered the question she knew she needn't bother asking. He growled at the phone. ""Jarvis is a nosy busybody.""

Nat couldn't help the way her torso shook with laughter when the phone rang.

""I've just received a text message from a concerned, artificial butler modeled after a very good friend of mine, darling. I assume you've received our message loud and clear?"" Nat only heard Peggy's demand thanks to her enhanced hearing.

""Our  message?"" Steve asked his former wife and longtime friend.

""Yes, ours. Gabe and I have been worried, you know."" She paused, murmuring to someone in the background. ""We've had a change in plans. We're coming up for the holidays. Be a dear and let Anthony know we'll be visiting for a week or so to beat some good sense into an old friend.""

Steve sighed, but a smile curved his lips. ""There ever gonna be a time you're not givin' me orders, Peg?""

""Seems unlikely,"" she hummed thoughtfully. ""There ever gonna be a time you're not a stubborn, pigheaded mule, Steven?"" she drawled in an American accent.

""Not bloody likely,"" Steve riposted in a surprisingly excellent English accent.

Peggy laughed until she nearly cried.

When her good humor was finally spent, Steve sighed with a wry smile. ""When will you be here?""

""An hour's time; no more.""

"" 'Change of plans', my foot,"" Steve grumbled. ""More like checkin' up on me."" But his expression was clear and calm, the worst of the storm past in the aftermath of Peggy's attempt to huff and puff and blow away the little dark cloud hanging over his head. 

""Aw, don't be sore, darling. You could have avoided this, you know,"" she snorted inelegantly, ""if only you'd got off your ass and asked the lovely woman--""

""See you soon, Peg,"" Steve cut her off and thumbed off the phone. He pressed it to his forehead and laughed.

""Do I want to know what all that was about?"" Nat wondered, snuggling deeper under his arm to steal an extra degree of heat, wishing she'd thought to grab her coat before running out with Steve.

""The ring in my pocket,"" Steve responded simply, punching the breath from Nat's lungs. He gave her an apologetic squeeze as he pocketed the phone. ""Don't worry. I'm not ready yet. Sam's got a friend he wants me to talk to, another shrink, I guess. The doctor I been workin' with at the VA is retiring and I still got more issues than the Saturday Evening Post to work through. Didn't think it was fair to ask before I straightened out my head about..."" he trailed off, swiping a hand under his eyes.

""Losing everything that mattered while you were in the ice?"" she ventured with care, rubbing her temple against his shoulder.

He nodded, but amended, ""Used to matter. Times change, and so have I.""

""When you're ready to ask, I'll still be here. There's no rush."" Never any rush. He could take forever, as far as she was concerned. The piece of paper didn't matter; she was Steve's best friend and he, hers, and both of them more than best friends, too, no matter his past or feelings about it. She'd long since made peace with the knowledge that Steve was once married to Peggy and still not over the loss or impermanence of it, maybe never would be. There was never any divorce or annulment for closure because, Steve told her, he was pronounced dead before the certificate of marriage had ever been filed. Since Peggy never filed for widow's benefits, either, the issue was laid to rest with Steve's empty coffin at Arlington.

Until he woke in the future to find his wife remarried twice, this time to retired Army Major Gabriel Jones--her third happy marriage in a long, storied life. Peggy took her vows seriously, it appeared, moving on after losing both her first husband and her second, Daniel Sousa, to tragedy in the line of duty. And Steve was happy for them. Peggy moved on like she promised.

Steve just needed time to do the same.

He requested and received the original U.S. Army certificate of marriage from Brigadier General Chester Phillips' classified SSR files, but Nat knew that weighty slip of paper sat in a safe, buried deep in a safehouse she helped Steve arrange for Bucky two years ago in Sheepshead Bay. He told Nat he needed to know it was real, since history hadn't recorded the marriage and the War Department never released the newsreel footage because of concerns for Peggy's safety for the year after the wedding. If a child had been born of the serum-enhanced soldier and his new wife, Peggy and the child would have been in great danger, indeed, without him present in their lives to protect them.

But there was no child and, as far as history was concerned, Steven Grant Rogers went into the ice a bachelor hero.

""You should talk to Peggy about it when she visits,"" Nat suggested, knowing she was right the moment the words left her lips.

""About what?"" Steve's brow furrowed in confusion and he somehow squeezed her even tighter without crossing the threshold to too much.

""What to do with the marriage license."" She smiled. ""Imagine the uproar if the two of you donated it together to the Smithsonian for the Cap exhibit--the miniseries and Academy Award-winning movies that would follow."" She sat up a little straighter and wrapped her arms tight around his middle, sharing her mile-wide grin with her lover and best friend. ""Think of the Nicholas Spark movie, Steve! Do it for the romantic drama.""

He rolled his eyes and scoffed, reaching across his lap to slip a hand under her legs and slide her over his so he could wrap both arms around her, too.

""And where do you fit in that story?"" he worried, pressing his forehead to hers.

""Right here, where I belong,"" she answered without pause, bringing her lips to his. ""You're stuck with me now, Rogers.""

""Like chewed gum on my shoe,"" he whispered seductively in her ear, making her laugh into the night as snowflakes began to drift from the sky overhead, blanketing the world around them in glittering white.

Pulling himself together, Steve rose to his feet, arms full of his favorite redhead, and returned to the rec room where the slideshow party was breaking up, shifting to the latter part of their evening plans: decorating the newly renovated rec room. Bucky was wide awake after his nap and raring to go, darting after Steve Pawgers and Barky Barnes to one end of the enormous room, toward a stately stone fireplace, surrounded by comfortable seating for no less than a dozen people in shades of dark burgundy, emerald green, and navy. To the side, sat an informal family dining area with smaller tables and booths, where they would come together for dinner before attending midnight mass. Darcy stood on one of the long benches beside Tony, trying to convince him to let her help him assemble gifts up in the loft instead of decorating.

""No can do, kiddo."" Tony kissed the top of her head and handed her a placemat to set down on the far end of the table in one of the booths.

""But what  am  I allowed to help wif?"" she whined, still a little rough around the edges from her late nap.

""You can help me!"", ""And me!"", ""Me, too!"" came a chorus of adult voices in response.

""Fine."" She huffed, crossing her arms, and stomped off to tag along with Pepper.

""Late naps make her cranky,"" Tony said by way of apology.

""Thteebie, Thteebie! Gueth what?"" Bucky barreled into the group of adults like a bulldozer. ""Falcon Tham'th mom and dad are comin' ta dinner!""

""I heard!"" he matched his best pal's enthusiasm easily, dropping to one knee to speak to him eye to eye. ""They're real excited to meet you. And my friend Peggy is coming up, too. They had a change of plans,"" he said in an aside to Tony, who sucked in a sharp breath and stalked off to talk to Pepper.

""Mith Peggy who thent me da wagon?"" Bucky bounced on his toes.

""Yup, and she's going to have dinner with us, and go to mass, and probably whatever else we do the next few days,"" Steve confirmed.

""That'th thwell, Thteebie."" Buck danced a little to the Christmas music Jarvis turned on, unconsciously expending excess energy. ""Hey, did you know Darthy'th mom and pop awen't mawwied?"" The question carried to the far corners of the rec room.

A hush fell.

Steve nodded. ""I did know that. Times have changed. I know it must be confusing for you, pal, but a lot of time has passed since you and I were six together last time. Families are real different now. They're made up of all kinds of people and relationships these days.""

""You mean wike how Natathya ith my thithter, but altho ya betht fwiend and  wrethlin' partner ?"" Bucky winked, wiggling his butt with six-year-old delight to be in on that grownup secret now.  

""James Buchanan Barnes, you little shit."" Steve narrowed his eyes.

""Is that any way to talk to that darling baby?"" a familiar voice called from the entryway.

Bucky gasped and spun around to face their newest guest. ""Awe you Momma Fawcon Tham?""

She snorted and dropped the bags full of presents she'd brought along at her feet, dusting her hands on her jeans. ""I sure as hell am, though most people just call me Darlene or Colonel Wilson. Come gimme some sugar, pumpkin."" She leaned over and held out her arms.

Unable to resist that kind of invitation, Bucky bulldozed into Sam's mom just like any other adult he knew offering hugs. He really did love hugs.

""Look at you."" She brushed the hair out of his eyes and set him back a few inches to pop the reading glasses from the top of her head onto her nose and check him over with a practiced mother's eye. ""I swear you've grown a foot since the last photos Sam sent me.""

Bucky looked down at the floor and asked the only question that really mattered: ""Whaddaya mean?"" He pointed. ""I onwy got two feet!""

Mrs. Wilson threw her head back and laughed until her sides ached. ""Lord, boy, you are a treat. I hear we've got decorating to do and I've got all these presents to go under the tree."" She took his hand in hers and stood, turning a beady eye on Steve. ""Don't you have anything better to do than stand around catching flies with your mouth open like that, young man?""

""Young?"" Clint choked and tried to turn it into a cough.

And that's the story of how Steve ended up in the loft over the summer kitchen with Tony, drunk-assembling bikes, R/C drones, and the tiniest Iron Man mockup suits he'd ever seen--drunk-assembling that wouldn't have been possible under normal circumstances, but Tony and Bruce helpfully synthesized a super-serum version of rum for the enjoyment of all the enhanced folks on the team. Steve had an Iron Man flask full of the coconut and pineapple flavored devil juice and really no excuse for jabbing himself with the screwdriver the third time he tried to put the goddamned drone together and cram some cheap, Chinese-made batteries up its ass-end, except that the super booze worked and he was tanked like he hadn't been since little Stevie Rogers was getting his stubborn, sickly ass kicked in all the finest Brooklyn back alleys.

""How you doing up there, boys?"" Natasha called after the third litany of shouted curse word combinations no one had heard since Germany occupied Poland.

""Fine, just damn fine, but it's a good thing I heal fast,"" he muttered, dabbing at the gaping wound in his palm with a filthy shop rag until his metabolic enhancements closed the hole.

""Well, Tony doesn't heal like you, so mind your step,"" she warned conversationally from the bottom of the stairs so he could hear her clearly.

""Yes, ma'am,"" Steve snarked, toasting in her direction and swilling another sip from his grownup juice box.

""Hey, Thteebie, whathya doin' up thewe?""

""None'a your beeswax, nosy!"" Steve called back, following it up with a burp that would've done twelve year old Bucky proud.

Tony gave him an unimpressed look. ""What are you,  five?""

""No, I'm this many."" Steve flipped him off.

The engineer rolled his eyes, but amusement tugged at his lips and he changed the subject without warning, ""Has Bucky started asking when you're marrying Nat yet?""

""Not since he caught us wrestling naked."" 

Tony choked so hard on the beer he'd been sipping, Steve had to pat him on the back, maybe a little too hard, though, because the other man ended up sprawled across the floor. ""Okay,"" Tony said, rolling over with a wince, ""you're done here. Go help Rosa peel more potatoes before I end up in traction.""

Steve so surprised himself with that bit of honesty, he lifted the spout of the flask to eye the contents suspiciously before following Tony's instructions. ""This shit better not be a truth serum, too.""

But when Steve descended from the loft, Rosa waved him over to Natasha. ""No. You're a menace, Captain Rogers. Go bother your lady.""

Natasha, who bit her lip, trying not to laugh as she strung popcorn with Bucky handing her pieces to thread out of a bowl by her side. ""Aw, Rogers, did you get a time-out?"" she teased gently.

Over her shoulder, Steve spotted Sam's dad sneaking up the stairs with a six-pack and a toolkit to lend Tony a hand in Steve's place.

He sighed. ""I guess.""

""Come keep me and James company,"" she insisted, patting the sofa by her side, but Steve climbed right up over the back and squeezed in behind his pretty, redheaded doll, pressing a kiss under her hair that stilled her hands and left Bucky grumbling about Steve holding up the whole works.

""What are you so sore about?"" Steve peered over Nat's shoulder at his tiny best friend.

""Thteeb Pawgerth pooped on da fwoor and Darthy thepped in it wif hew fabowite thneakerth, and now the'th cwanky and maybe mad at me becauthe I fo'got ta walk 'im tho he'd poop outthide whewe hith poop bewongth."" He pouted, accidentally crushing a handful of popcorn. ""Aw, dammit."" He threw the popcorn at Pizza Dog's feet.

""Buck..."" Steve warned the cursing six-year-old, but he cast an accusing eye on Hawkeye who grinned back, totally unrepentant.

""Language!"" everyone in the room sang out as they put the finishing touches on the decorations for Christmas Eve dinner.

Peggy shows up with a surprise for Bucky, but he has questions. Lots of questions, as it turns out, but he might not be old enough for a while to hear all the answers.... What about tomorrow? He'll definitely be older tomorrow.

I hate the shit out of canon, sometimes. Let's do something about that this chapter, shall we?You may also note I've changed the chapter count today to a question mark. 65 chapters was a wildly inaccurate guess on my part. Surprise! *throws confetti* This story is going to be a lot longer than any of us realized.

 .,, . *""*. , .    *""*.,,.*""'* 

 

Out in the yard, where the snow fell from the sky in big, fluffy flakes like small clouds and Bucky could throw the giantest stick he ever found for Steve Pawgers and Yasha and Barky Barnes to chase (and where he was only hiding for a little bit from the adults who wanted him to take a bath before Christmas Eve dinner and midnight mass), he heard a long, low rumble in the distance. Squinting at the sky, he spotted the slight disturbance in the air around the cloaked jet just like Natasha taught him to look for, but only about a minute before it could land. No time to run to the door and announce they had a visitor, then.

Instead, he pulled the fancy phone Darcy's pop gave him out of his pocket, pushed the button on the side how Stevie showed him to do if he wanted to use it like a walkie-talkie toy, and Bucky said, ""Jawvith, thewe'th a quinyet about ta wand in'a fwont yawd. Thould I teww thomeboby?""

""Already done, Master Barnes. The quinjet is expected. Captain Rogers asks that you please do not approach it until the engines have powered down.""

""Hey, Jawvith?""

""Young sir?""

""How'th come you caww Thteebie 'Ca'tain Wogerth'? I fought I heawd you caww him annover name duwin' da thlidethow.""

""I understand your confusion, sir. Captain Rogers has set the parameters by which I may address him. I believe he prefers to go by Captain Rogers in all non-military situations as it's less confusing for civilians to remember how to address the man they only recognize as Captain America, which is a codename rather than a rank title in the armed services. However, the files that need be accessed for the information he requested during the slideshow listed Major General Rogers by his proper rank, so I must use that rank and name under those circumstances.""

""Huh."" Bucky scratched his chin as the quinjet made a soft thump in the grass. ""That'th weiwd. Thankth, Jawvith.""

""You are most welcome, young sir.""

""Buck?"" Stevie jogged down the front steps from the lodge out onto the lawn with Bucky's play coat in his hands. ""You'll catch your death out here in just that hoodie, pal. What were you thinkin'?""

Bucky lifted a shoulder. Hadn't really thought of that, he guessed.

""Thorry, Thteebie,"" he apologized, shoving his arms into the coat his best friend held out to him. Steve Pawgers got a hold of one of the gloves pinned to the sleeves and started tugging on it, so Bucky was distracted when the quinjet landed and the door thing on the back finally opened, but not for real long because a whole bunch of people all tumbled out at once, jogging down the jet ramp towards him and Stevie like they were holding a whole big plate full of cookies.

Stevie shouted in surprise!

With a yelp, Bucky ducked behind Stevie and scrambled to grab hold of Steve Pawgers' collar and Barky Barnes' collar so they wouldn't get smashed flat by all the people running at them. Yasha was on his own, poor, dumb dog who only wanted to love on everybody. It was about to get him squished flat like a bug.

But the only one who got squished was Stevie and he could take it, from what Bucky saw peeking around Stevie's leg. Agent Barton said Stevie was built like a brick shit house. They didn't have any of those in their tenement in Brooklyn, but Bucky figured a brick shit house must be like the size of a tank because Stevie sure did seem as big as one sometimes.

""Gentleman!"" a loud, lady voice called over the racket all those fellas made, pounding on Stevie's back and hugging on him and doing their best to knock him right off his feet. When the fellas quieted down to look back at the lady, she said, ""You're scaring James. Now, move aside so I can say a proper hello the boy already.""

They stepped aside for the lady, spreading out from Stevie's sides like planes flying in fancy formation.

""Here now."" The lady walked briskly down the stairs the way Miss Pepper did sometimes when she didn't have time for anybody to stand in her way. The lady had brown hair and blue eyes, and she wore a real fancy red coat that matched her lips with black furry stuff at the sleeves of the coat and around her neck, like somebody out of a moving picture, with her fitted pants and tall, black boots.

""Steve,"" she said, stopping to hug Stevie, and then she kissed him right on the lips in front of everybody!

""Peg."" Stevie hugged her back like they didn't see each other in forever and he smiled, but in the sad way he sometimes did when they talked about Brooklyn and both of their mas. ""Nat says your security chief checked in with Hill to rearrange your schedule to visit with us for the rest of the month, at least. I hope that means you'll be with us a while.""

""It does."" She brushed the hair off his forehead that always fell in his face, then glanced down at Bucky with shiny eyes.

""Wow."" Bucky blinked up at the lady. She looked just like Gloria Swanson in the theater posters back in Brooklyn. ""Wow,"" he breathed again.

""Hello, James."" The lady squatted down with her knees tucked to the side so she could look right at him in the eye, but Bucky was too starstruck to notice much because she looked just like Gloria Swanson in fur and beads and fancy clothes at fancy parties just like in the moving pictures.

""You wook wike Gwowia Thwanthon,"" Bucky barely managed to say the words out loud before he swallowed real hard and shuffled behind Stevie. Butterflies jumped all around in his belly.

""What did you say, darling?"" the lady asked, holding up a hand to shush her muttering friends.

But Stevie laughed. ""He said you look like Gloria Swanson.""

The lady smiled a smile with lots of dimples and soft lines around her eyes, and all her friends laughed and laughed and laughed. Bucky felt his face turn red and he buried it in the back of Stevie's coat.

""Oh, darling, what a lovely compliment,"" the lady said. Then, she turned and barked at the fellas with her, ""Will you lot quit braying like a pack of mules?""

She huffed like she was mad, then returned her attention to Bucky. ""My name is Peggy Carter. I'm Steve's very good friend and Anthony's godmother. You needn't come out to say hello if you don't want to, but I would very much like to make your acquaintance, James. I've heard so much about you from Steve and Anthony, and Jarvis, of course.""

With burning cheeks, Bucky huffed into Stevie's jacket and peered out at the noisy adults. He'd never got so nervous meeting anybody in his whole life, but he'd never met anybody who looked like Gloria Swanson before, either.

Stevie twisted and put an arm around Bucky's shoulder, squatting next to Bucky. Steve Pawgers and Barky Barnes started nipping at the hem of Stevie's coat right off.

""I know you don't remember it right now, but you and I met Peggy a very long time ago. She helped train me when the army picked me for a special project to make me big and strong. She was my best girl back during the war. And these fellas here,"" he pointed to Miss Peggy's friends and Bucky finally got a good look at all of them in the light from the porch, ""these are the Howling Commandos.""

""I know who dey are,"" Bucky whispered, but he barely made a sound when he said it because  he knew who they were! All of them! And he couldn't believe they were really here!  ""They got a TV thow. Tony putth it on fo' me and Darthy ta wathtch wif Dum-E and Buttahfingahth durin' lunthch, thometimeth.""

The one who had to be Jim Morita rolled his eyes, ""That Howling Heroes sitcom garbage they made in the sixties?"" He snorted and shook his head, ""Stark.""

""But Thteebie,"" Bucky whispered urgently, half-climbing his best pal, ""thothe awe da Howwin' Commandoth. I know them. They'we weal hewoes. Thteebie, that'th Dum Dum Dugan,"" he said, so excited, tugging on Stevie's coat. ""And Falthwowth, and Gabe Joneth, and Jim Mowita, and Jock Doonie-ay.""

""Jacques Dernier,"" Stevie said the name nice and slow for Bucky. ""And yes, they are the Howling Commandos, but they're our friends, too. Have been since the war.""

Bucky almost swallowed his tongue. He was really friends with the Howling Commandos when he was a growedup?

""Sarge,"" the biggest fella, Dum Dum Dugan, removed his hat and saluted Bucky. The other fellas did the same. Bucky just stared. Then, he wondered if maybe he ought'a salute back or something. He rolled his lips nervously and looked at Stevie, unsure what to do, but Dum Dum decided for him, dropping his saluting hand as he dropped to one knee right there in the snow. ""It's real good to see you again ... kid. Christ, Rogers, I know you said he was a kid again, but this is somethin' else...""

""Thteebie?"" Bucky shifted from foot to foot. Everyone was staring at him. Then Bucky remembered something Stevie said. ""You thaid they wewe our fwiendth in da waw, wight?"" Bucky peered at the growedups surrounding him in the dim porch light. ""Why don't they wook wike they'we a hundwed, then?""

Everyone on the lawn glanced at each other over Bucky's head and out of the corners of their eyes, but no one had an answer for Bucky, even though they all looked like they wanted to say  something .

Stevie scratched his head. ""That's real complicated, pal.""

And Miss Peggy looked even younger than some of the fellas, even though Bucky knew he had seen her picture in books and the newspaper with grey hair and more wrinkles. She rolled her eyes. ""It's not so complicated as all that. These yahoos,"" she pointed to the Commandos, ""got caught up in a lab accident courtesy of our friend Howard Stark--Anthony's father--an accident not so very different from your own, James, oh, back in the ... late forties, early fifties, I suppose? They're aging quite slowly, though, rather than turning into children, no matter how much they might act like naughty school boys,"" she joked when Falsworth stuck out his tongue. Like lightning, Miss Peggy snatched at it and pinched his tongue between her fingers with a laugh for the surprised look on his face.

""Wow,"" Bucky said. Miss Peggy was as fast as Nat. And she seemed to be about the same age, but ... something about that didn't sit right with Bucky.

""This,"" she said, motioning to the tall man nearby with very dark brown skin like Bucky's and Stevie's friend, Falcon Sam, ""is my husband, Gabe Jones.""

""Then howth come you teww peopwe you'we Peggy Cawtuh?"" Bucky had to know.

""Do you know what my name would be if I took my husbands' name and kept them each of the times I married?"" she asked, draping her arm over her knee as she lowered the other knee to the snow.

Bucky shook his head. He didn't know.

""Her Excellency, Margaret Elizabeth Mary Carter-Rogers-Sousa-Jones, Her Brittanic Majesty's Special Envoy from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United States.""

""That'th a wot of nameth an' fanthy wordth,"" Bucky breathed. He shook his head. ""I couldn't eben thay aww of thothe nameth and wordth, or a'member aww of 'em.""

""Well, there you go."" She shrugged and tidied Bucky's coat and scarf to block out the chill. ""A troublesome, bloody mouthful is what it is. Easier to just use the name my parents gave me, I think.""

Bucky squared his shoulders and finally offered his hand. ""My whowe name is Jameth Boochanan Barneth-Wogerth-Womanoff because I got paperth that thay I bewong wif Thteebie and Nat now, but my famiwy jutht cawwth me Bucky, tho I thuppothe you can, too. Nithe ta meecha, Mith Peggy Cawtuh.""

""The pleasure is all mine, Bucky,"" she answered with the cheeky dimples and soft eye lines again, closing her hands around his like a hug from an old friend. ""I hear we've big plans for this evening. Dinner and church, and then Santa will be coming, of course.""

Bucky's eyes bugged almost right out of his head. ""THANTA?!"" He turned and looked at Stevie. ""You don't fink he heawd abou' that day in da ventth, do you?""

""Hard to know for sure."" Stevie shrugged. ""Better be on your best behavior the rest of the night, though, just to be on the safe side.""

Bucky nodded and crossed his heart. ""I thwear, I won't jimmy a thingle wock or wook at eben  one  naked wady picthure, Thteebie,  pwomithe.""

The Howling Commandos laughed and laughed and laughed forever, it felt like, but Bucky wasn't sure why.

Adults. He shrugged. So weird, sometimes.

""That sounds like quite a story,"" Miss Peggy said. ""Let's go warm up inside and you can tell me all about it. I'm sure it's nothing Santa can't forgive. I once  accidentally --"" she winked at Bucky, ""--shut my older brother up in the attic for six hours and Santa didn't hold that against  me.""

""Hey, Mith Peggy? You neber anthwered my whowe quethtion."" Bucky tugged on her hand to get her attention.

""What is it, darling?"" She paused on the stairs to look down at him.

""Howth come you wook eben youngah than the Howwin' Commandoth?""

""That, I think,"" she tapped her chin, ""is a story better suited for telling when you're older, but--"" she held up a finger before Bucky could interrupt to ask why her face and hair looked so much younger in person than in the newspaper and books, too, ""I do promise to explain when you're old enough to understand. Will that do?""

""I'm cuwiouth now, but I gueth it won't huwt to wait a whiwe. How owd do I gotta be?"" He kicked the rise of the step and snow fell on the tip of his boot.

""Older than you are now,"" she answered.

""Tho ... tomowwow?"" Bucky asked hopefully.

""We'll see what kind of progress Anthony is making on reverse-engineering the results of your accident first; then, we'll see to the rest,"" she swore, crossing her heart.

Bucky sighed. ""Nat and Thteebie thay that all'a time."" He kicked a big chunk of snow off the top porch step as Steve helped him up the last rise. ""We'ww thee."" He rolled his eyes. ""That jutht meanth they don't wanna awgue about it wight  now.""

""Clever little monkey."" Peggy patted his cheek. ""I've made my promise and I intend to keep it. You must practice patience until then.""

Bucky curled his lip and grumped as Stevie hustled him and the dogs into the lodge with all the noisy adults, ""Pwactithin' patienthe thoundth a wot wike 'we'ww thee' from whewe I'm thtandin'.""

Darcy looks so pretty in her ugly Christmas sweater and plastic Thor helmet when she smiles, sneaking raviolis to her puppy under the table, and Bucky has a very funny feeling about it.

""NATASHA! "" the Howling Commandos cried as they pounded up the steps into the lodge, sweeping up Bucky's big sister and covering her in kisses hello.

""Hey, fellas. Wow, somebody brought the Smithsonian's whole fossil collection this time, huh?"" Natasha teased and made sure to kiss every whiskery face and smooth cheek presented to her as they stomped their boots and disappeared inside, until Dum Dum Dugan stopped in front of her, blocking out all the light, except the tiny strand of lights over the doorway, shining on the big ball of mistletoe hanging there.

Dum Dum glanced up at it and wiggled his mustache.

Natasha glanced up at it and her lips twisted like how Stevie made that double-dog-dare face when they were still kids at the same time.

And Bucky held his breath.

""Romanoff."" Dum Dum nodded once.

""Major."" Nat nodded back.

Nobody even  breathed.

At the same time, Nat and Dum Dum blinked and went for it face first, just like that time Tommy Mendler ate three whole pies at the pie eating contest. It was AWFUL.

Nat kissed Dum Dum.

Dum Dum kissed Nat.

Right on the mouth!

Yuck!

Then they laughed and Stevie made a joke Bucky didn't understand about Dum Dum finding his own girl, but Bucky didn't know what got into everybody all of a sudden, kissin' all the time. One time, he even walked into a closet and turned on a light and Darcy's ma and pop were in there, right under the grand staircase at the lodge.

Kissing! Where anybody who picked the lock and walked into the closet could see!

Gross!

And Miss Pepper stumbled a little afterward, like she forgot how to walk!

Bucky couldn't figure why anybody would wanna kiss a girl anyhow. He thought it over all through his bath and even let Stevie pick his candy cane-striped suspenders and bow tie to match the special sweater vest Nat bought him that was supposed to be real ugly.

Boy, it sure was ugly, Bucky thought when Nat pulled the green sweater out of his closet and flicked a little switch inside the pocket so it lit up like a Christmas tree! All six of the original Avengers blinked and moved in slow motion as the lights rotated through the pattern to make the people look like they were fighting real tiny alien space whales and Doom Bots.

""Neat."" Bucky tried to shove his arm through the arm hole, but the button on his red dress shirt snagged and he couldn't quite get it.

""Let me help."" Nat knelt on the floor and rescued Bucky's sleeve from the vest, then covered the buttons with her fingers as Bucky slid his arms through. When he was all buttoned up with his new candy cane bow-tie straightened, Nat kissed him on the nose.

""Nat?"" It was now or never.

""Hmm?"" she asked, brushing a piece of lint from his sweater vest.

""Why do people kith?""

She sat back on her heels and took a slow breath, tapping her fingers on the top of her leg and thinking over her answer. ""People kiss for a lot of reasons. Mainly, they kiss to express affection or love, though not always romantically.""

Bucky wrinkled his nose. ""Womantic ith wike with heartth and Cupid thootth you wif an awwow that maketh you thtupid enough to wanna wrethle naked and make a baby, wight?""

His big sister pressed her lips together in that way that meant she was trying not to smile real big because Bucky accidentally said something funny.

""Yes,"" she finally agreed, ""that is one view of how romantic love works. It's not the only kind of love or the only reason people kiss, though.""

""Why elthe would people kith?"" Bucky couldn't figure out why anybody'd wanna put their mouth on another person's mouth for funsies.

""There are different types of love. There's romantic love, like when I kiss Steve--""

""--ow when I tuwned onna wight inna cwothet and yewwed weal woud becauthe Darthy'th pop wath kithin' Darthy'th ma thtupid,"" Bucky added helpfully. ""Doeth that mean dey gonna wrethle naked thoon, too, and make a baby with Tony'th erecthion?""

Nat blinked at him for a few seconds, then her one eyebrow did that thing where it crawled halfway up her head. ""Apparently, I missed a conversation.""

""Thteebie told me aww about erecthionth and how people in wub make babieth wif dem by wrethlin' naked. Me and the fellath talked about it. Guy thtuff."" He crossed his arms so she'd know she couldn't get it out of him even with enough tickles.

Nat laughed, but she nodded. ""Okay. There's also familiar love--the kind of love you have for your family, the reason Steve kisses you goodnight or I kiss your booboos to make you feel better or the way Darcy hugs her daddy very close and rubs her face against his whiskers to kiss him through his scruff. It's all a way to say 'I love you' without the words. You're showing the people you love them or have affection for them, but some people don't like to be kissed, so you should always ask.""

Bucky thought all that over a minute. ""I wub dogth, but I don't kith Thteeb Pawgerth,"" he pointed out.

""No,"" she agreed, ""but the dogs do kiss  you  with their tongues when they lick all over your face and jump on you and try to knock you down to play with them on the floor. That's playful love. They're so excited and happy, they just have to kiss you to share their joy with you.""

""Wike how you kithed Dum Dum at the door?"" he checked.

""Yes."" Nat laughed again. ""Dum Dum and I are friends. We like to tease each other.""

Mulling that one over, Bucky thought he might have an idea for a kind of love that meant no kissing. ""Agen' Bawton wubeth awwowth and piztha, but he doethn't kith 'em.""

""We'll have to agree to disagree there."" Nat rolled her eyes, but she looked like she even loved Agent Barton's silliness. ""I've seen Clint kiss an arrow for luck, but that's a good example of a different type of love: obsessive love, usually that's a one-sided kind of love for an object or an unattainable relationship with a person, though. Not the healthiest kind of love for your heart,"" she smiled sadly.

""Oh! I know! Wha' about when Mith Peggy kithed Theebie when thee awwived? Thee hath a hubthand and Thteebie wubth you, tho why did they kith?"" he wondered, really confused, because it wasn't playful love and it didn't look like family love or even like Miss Peggy thought Stevie was a swell-looking arrow that needed a kiss for good luck to hit a target...

Nat brushed a hand through Bucky's hair. ""You really are a clever little monkey. Sometimes, people can be in love with more than one person at time, or love people romantically in different ways. What Peggy and Steve have is enduring love. Circumstances have kept them apart and they still love each other and always will, but now there are layers of other types of love between them, too, affection and family love, and another kind of special love called selfless love. Steve loves Peggy so much, he wants her to be happy with her husband and would never want to come between them for his own selfish reasons, even if it makes him sad sometimes."" She took a deep breath and let it out real slow. ""It's a very noble kind of love."" She stopped talking, turned her head, and sniffed.

""Nat?"" Bucky moved around to the side to see why she wouldn't look at him, something pushing him to give her a hug and make her feel better. ""Why you cwyin'?""

When his arms tightened around her neck, she squeezed him gently and said very softly by Bucky's ear, ""There are things that remind me sometimes how much Steve is still hurting inside over things he can't change and, because I love him, my heart hurts because his hurts. I wish I could make it better.""

""But Nat..."" Bucky leaned back to look at his sister. ""You do make it bettuh. He'th not thad alla time. Thometimeth, aftuh he kitheth you, he thmileth weal big when ya not wookin', wike he won a pwizthe at Coney Iwand. And ya make me happy, too. I wath weal thad after the accthident that made me an' Darthy wittle becauthe my ma wath gone and my who' famiwy, but den you and Thteebie made uth a famiwy and wubbed me a wot, enough for my ma and pop and my who' famiwy, and made me not thad anymore.""

""There's  another kind of love for you,"" Nat said, folding her hands over each other on Bucky's back for another tight squeeze and kiss to his forehead. ""Compassionate love. I love you, James. Thank you for reminding me of all the reasons I have to be happy.""

""I wub you, too, Nat."" Bucky puckered up for a kiss and Nat obliged, pecking him on the lips. It wasn't so bad.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

""There, you see?"" Rosa demanded, setting an enormous bowl full of homemade ravioli in front of Bucky. Bucky beamed at the ravioli with a new understanding for the way Agent Barton looked at his arrows sometimes.

Across the table, in her winged Thor helmet with silver and green ribbons braided into her hair, Darcy smiled right back, already chewing happily on a mouthful of ravioli as the LED scene playing across her ugly sweater displayed a living manger scene of Cap and Iron Man, gathered around the Baby Hulk's creche, while the three Wise Ones (Miss Pepper, Rhodey, and Nat) stood off to the side, alternately pointing at either the north star (that looked a lot like Stevie's shield) or offering gifts of candy canes, Starkphones, and a soothing lullaby to the newborn Baby Hulk. Robots sat on either side of Baby Hulk's creche, too, with animal ear headbands wrapped around their top-mounted cameras. On the roof of the manger, Hawkeye and Thor looked down with angel wings sprouting from their backs and funny circles of light around their heads like the saints in the stained glass windows of Bucky's old church back in Brooklyn. Sauce dribbled down Darcy's chin and all over Hawkeye's glowing angel head when a ravioli missed her mouth, but that was okay because she picked it up and snuck her hand under the table to give a bite to Barky Barnes.

Bucky felt a funny feeling in his belly when Darcy caught him looking and she held a finger to her smiling lips. Her eyes sparkled in the rainbow light off of all the blinking ugly sweaters at the table and Bucky felt a swell of something bumping against the bottom of his heart.

Oh.


 Oh. 


Love.

Bucky loved Darcy.

But... Did that mean Darcy loved him like he loved her? And did he  have  to kiss her? Would she be expecting him to kiss her? Would they have to wrestle naked when they were adults, too, or was that optional?

""Thteebie!"" The yelp came out of Bucky's big mouth before he realized it was happening. He got down from the table and set down his napkin where Steve Pawgers couldn't chew it, then hauled Stevie off to the kitchen to ask his pal some very important questions.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

Cooties, germs, and how not to Hulk-out. Important life lessons lie herein.

So... I got a ton of requests for a first kiss under the mistletoe way back when I started this story. After a good long think about that, I came up with this. ;-)

Darcy followed her Daddy to the pass-through to the kitchen to hand over the stack of bowls she carried from the table Mr. Dum Dum and Mr. Jim and Mssr. Jacques cleared after dinner. On the other side of the window, Darcy could just see Captain Steve's blond hair and hear him talking.

""Pal, nobody expects you to kiss anybody.""

""But what about the mithtletoe?"" Darcy heard Bucky ask. ""When ya thtuck undah it, everboby whithtleth and hollerth ta kith, but what if I don't wike kithin'?""

Captain Steve shrugged his shoulders. ""Then don't kiss.""

""But..."" Bucky's voice wobbled. ""I wike her a wot.""

""But kissin's a big step, Buck. Maybe you could try tellin' her instead of worrying about whether she'll want to kiss,"" Captain Steve reminded Bucky. ""What's your hurry, pal? There's plenty of time for kissing when you're older.""

Darcy glanced up at her daddy when his hand fell on her shoulder.

""Dr. Bruce said kissing and hugging can spread germs and gamma raditation,"" she told her daddy quietly so she wouldn't interrupt Bucky and Captain Steve.

Daddy laughed, but he squatted down beside Darcy and nodded his head. ""I think Dr. Bruce has other reasons for not kissing and hugging very much, but those are good ones, for sure. Wouldn't want to catch cooties, would you?"" He lifted his hands and made them look like tickle claws so Darcy could decide before he tickled if she wanted to play that game. She nodded and Daddy's hands closed around her ribs, making her scream and gasp for air as he turned her upside-down and made her braids dangle above the floor and made her laugh and laugh and laugh until she couldn't even breathe anymore.

""Are you sure you wouldn't rather stay at the Main Lodge?"" Darcy's mommy asked Senior Airman Falcon Sam's mommy as Daddy carried Darcy over to the coat closet upside-down while the adults finished clearing up the table and everyone else found their coats and boots for the snowy walk to the camp chapel up the road. ""There's an entire wing with no children, dogs, or Hawkeyes and several comfortable suites that could be readied in less than an hour.""

""Hey!"" Agent Clint complained from his favorite spot in the rafters, knocking an open bag of half-eaten Cheetos to the floor. Puppies swarmed all over it and left nothing but neon orange Cheeto dust on the rug.

""No, no,"" Mr. Falcon Sam's mommy replied. ""Sammy was right about that--we like to sleep in now that we're retired. That guest cottage my Sammy and Agent Hill showed us to is just perfect. Olde Orchard Cottage."" She shook her head. ""All decorated in pretty greens and reds and yellows like something out of a magazine. And with its own Christmas tree! It's lovely. Feels like a fancy bed and breakfast with the apple and cinnamon scent in the air and all those pillows. Damned if I know how you do it.""

""Robots, mostly,"" Daddy muttered to Darcy under his breath, making her giggle even more.

""Well, we hope it convinces you to stay with us for a while or at least to take advantage of the lodge on weekends when you can make time,"" Mommy said. ""If you'd like, we can have breakfast sent up in the morning by drone, too, so you can have the morning to yourselves without all the gift-opening chaos.""

""Drone?"" Mr. Falcon Sam's mommy looked skeptipal.

""Tony and I gave the camp and farm staff a few extra days off for the holidays, so we're employing more of Jarvis' mobile tools to automate the bare essentials, like meal service and housekeeping for the cabins and cottages.""

Rosa tsk'd and rolled her eyes. ""I'm only across the lake. If you'd let me come in for a few hours in the morning, all you'd have to do is check the turkey a few ti--""

""No."" Mommy's lips made the 'I've already decided face'. ""You work hard all year, Rosa. The holiday is for family.""

Rosa tilted her head to one side. ""Tony and I have been friends most of our lives and my mother was the Stark family cook at the Fifth Avenue townhouse until Tony went off to college. It's been long enough since we all spent a Christmas together and his parents' old friends are here now, too. It's no hardship to me, Pepper. Nor to Tom. No one's held a big family holiday here in a long time. Whether we're at home or here, the children will have fun and I will cook and Tommy will wash dishes. At least at the lodge there are more hands to help and a half dozen ovens and dishwashers to handle all the tedious work.""

Mommy sighed. ""When you put it like that ... but we're sending you to one of the houses in the Mediterranean in the spring, just you and Tom, for some R&R, a month of it.""

""I won't say no to that. A few weeks in the islands sounds lovely,"" Rosa agreed and patted Mommy on the arm. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. ""I've always wanted to do a big, family dinner party here for the holidays. It's what the Main Lodge was built for."" She rubbed her hands together like Mommy just gave her an awesome present.

Darcy turned to Bucky where he appeared with Captain Steve by the racks and racks of boots all lined up by the door. ""Adults are confusing.""

""You're tewwin' me."" He rolled his eyes. ""I athked Nat about kithin' earwier and it made her thad. If kithin' ith thad, how come adultth keep doin' it?""

""I dunno."" Darcy hugged her Bucky Bear close when her daddy dug it out of the pile of coats in the closet and wrapped Thor's cape around her waist and over her shoulders like a fancy red toga dress. Then, he held out her green coat to put on over top.

""Nat thayth kithin' ith an exthprethion of lub."" Bucky hopped from one foot to the other like he had ants in his pants.

Darcy wrinkled her nose. ""Daddy and Dr. Bruce said kissing causes cooties and gamma raditation exposure, so the best way to invade a cootie infection is to never kiss ever 'cause that's how ya get cooties and probably Hulk-out."" She stopped fidgeting with Thor's cape to eye Bucky. ""Why did you ask Miss Nat about kissing anyway?""

"" 'cauthe everboby'th alwayth kithin' alla time aroun' here!"" Bucky threw his arms up and his sweater vest started playing 'Shoot to Thrill'.

Daddy chuckled and Captain Steve groaned.

""It better not do that during the service tonight,"" Captain Steve warned Daddy who only shook his head.

""Well, I'm not kissing anybody but Mommy and Daddy,"" Darcy told Bucky, just to be clear, as she shoved her feet in her warm winter boots for the walk to the camp chapel, ""on account of cooties and germs and raditation poisoning. I don't want cooties. Or the flu. Or to turn green when I get cranky. Dr. Bruce said you can get the flu just like cooties, from too much kissing and hugging, and that's why he keeps to himself all the time and only hugs people like Captain Steve who are super immune.""

""But..."" Bucky chewed on his lip and wiggled his nose, watching Agent Barton drop from the rafters and wander past, cuddling one of Bucky's bunnies covered in Cheeto dust and talking to it in a sweet voice. ""What if you lubbed thomeboby a wot and they made you weal happy and kithin' 'em ith how you could thow them? What then?""

""If you love somebody and they make you real happy, you can show them by getting married and starting a multinational company one day so you can build robots together forever and ever,"" Darcy informed her friend. ""And buy companies to fix them and also beat up bad guys together sometimes,"" she amended.

Bucky looked like he wasn't sure about all that.

""What?"" she demanded when Bucky kept staring at her. She had a late nap and it always made her cranky like Hulk when Dr. Bruce turned green on accident. She wished Bucky would just spit out what he wanted to say already.

""I don't wanna get mawwied or or thtart a multinatthional comp'ny yet."" He scratched his head and obliged when Steve Pawgers bumped his free hand with his orange-Cheeto-dusty nose, demanding head scratches, too. ""But ... I wike you, Darthy,"" he said very quietly.

""I like you, too."" Darcy smiled real big. ""I don't wanna start a multinational company yet, either.""

""Or kiss."" Bucky made a face and stuck out his tongue.

Darcy did the same. ""Me, neither. Cooties and gamma poisoning? Nuh-uh. No, thanks,"" Darcy said real loud and her daddy laughed.

Bucky smiled up at Miss Nat when she helped him into his coat and Captain Steve held out his gloves, but he shook his head. ""No, thankth, Thteebie. I wanted-- I mean, Darthy, do you wanna hold my hand? Thteebie thaid that'th a way to thow thomeboby you wike dem wifout kithin'.""

""Okay."" Darcy shrugged and grabbed Bucky's hand, letting him lead her and Steve Pawgers and Barky Barnes out the door to wait for the adults as snow continued to fall from the sky like it had most of the day. (She tucked her Bucky Bear inside her cape-toga for safekeeping and so Barky Barnes wouldn't chew on it.) Her daddy ran out after them and pulled a knit hat on her head that looked like the Thor helmet she left by the table after dinner. As they wandered up the road toward the bridge across the lake and the chapel built into the side of the mountain, Daddy grabbed Darcy's free hand and Captain Steve grabbed Bucky's. Near the front of the group, the lady Daddy introduced as his Aunt Peggy held Mr. Gabe's hand and started to sing ""O Holy Night"" as they walked. Everyone else joined in after she sang the first few lines and the song bounced off the mountain and filled the whole valley around the lake with nothing but the sound of the Christmas carol.

Darcy shivered--in a good way because the singing was so nice--and smiled when Bucky adjusted his hand in hers to warm up her cold fingertips. It made Darcy feel happy and warm all over.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

Tony has an epiphany and comes to a decision. He can only hope Pepper (and their family) is on board.

I made an inspo board so all of you could see what's on my desktop while I worked on this chapter.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

With his voice raised in song, Tony reflected happily on the rapid changes in his life over the past year, the changes for the better in his relationship with Pepper, the bright young woman who'd unexpectedly blown into their lives like a vivacious whirlwind, the child she'd become, so desperately in need of unconditional love and family, and the steady, settled feeling growing in his chest day by day alongside the glowing blue light of lifesaving tech only made possible by the sacrifice of a good man and friend.

Tony had a wealth of reasons to be grateful that had nothing to do with his family name or money, and everything to do with accepting the love of the family growing in leaps and bounds around him.

""Your Uncle Gabe said his grandson might be coming up tomorrow, if he can find a ride,"" Pepper said, rubbing a hand along his ribs as they meandered through the snow with their arms thrown around one another and Darcy's tiny hand gripping his index finger. She chattered happily with Bucky, laughing at the antics of the larger dogs while the smaller dachshund puppies got a lift with their Howling Commando namesakes. Tony could be wrong, but he was almost certain Uncle Dum Dum had a piglet inside his jacket, too.

""We keep a spare quinjet at the airstrip here,"" Tony considered. It's not like they'd be using it and all the employees in need of a ride had been sent home the day before by whatever means Camp Stark and Stark Industries had available. ""Jarvis and I can remote-pilot it to the pickup point. Trip knows how to fly a quin.""

""You know him?"" Pepper glanced up at him in surprise.

""His mom. Muriel. She came up here when we were kids."" Had gone sledding and ice skating over the years with Tony and Rosa after midnight mass, and stayed up late, drinking hot cocoa in the converted apartment over the garage Tony claimed for himself at Camp Stark all through high school and college. She'd been one of the rare people Tony called 'friend' in those years. She knew exactly who he was and never expected anything but friendship of Tony because of it.

""Is she...?"" Pepper wondered.

""Gone now. Breast cancer."" Dammit. Tony shook his head. He should have been working on a cure for years at that point, but he spent too many self-involved years perfecting all the skills his father reviled most. Robotics, programming, artificial intelligence. Not a skill among them that could save Muriel, though. He made a promise to himself when she died, then: a cure for cancer in the years he had left, and better, safer ways to treat it in the meantime.

Muriel raised Trip alone, Tony knew that much. The kid went to live with his granddad and Aunt Peggy after his mom's passing twelve years back. Tony did the only thing he could for the boy at the time: set up a trust fund to cover college and other expenses, and made sure he'd never want for anything. It was the very least he could do for Muriel's son and still light years away from enough. He'd wasted too many years chasing his old man's ghost for approval or ignoring it out of spite, and he'd lost a lifelong friend while he focused on all the wrong things.

Tony was done wasting time and losing what mattered to him most. If he gleaned nothing else from the example of Steve's lost first life, he'd learned that much.

""Pep, wait."" He let go of Darcy's hand so she could run ahead up the chapel stairs where Bucky insisted on opening the door for her (with Steve's help to hold the heavy door). Bringing Pepper around with his arm, he gazed into her striking green eyes and blurted out what'd he'd been thinking about the last few days, ""Let's get married here. Next week. A fresh start on New Year's Day.""

""In a week?"" She screwed up her lips and blew the hair out of her eyes.

""We've been talking about it for so long. Everyone we'd invite, more or less, is already here."" He'd need to have one of his better winter suits retrieved from the house in Aspen. Rhodey would need his winter Class As sent up from the city. Same for Steve. Bucky... Well, Darcy was sure to have an opinion on what Bucky should wear. ""Unless you wanted a big New York wedding in the spring?"" He could see the draw of that, the ultra-formality, the business and political contacts to be made and reaffirmed, the glittering spread in every magazine, newspaper, and social media platform for days. If that's what Pepper wanted...

""We could do both."" She nudged him with a twinkle in her eye, warming to the idea quickly. ""A small family wedding next week just for us and a ball to celebrate in the spring while the cherry trees are in bloom at the townhouse on Fifth.""

All Tony managed to do was nod. It could not be this easy.

""You're lucky Darcy's been asking me when we planned to get married. I started shopping for a bridal suit after her concussion,"" she informed him as he offered her his arm to climb the stairs after everyone had gone inside to warm up over mulled cider in the entryway. The sound of Darcy's happy giggles filtered through the doors while the Howling Commandos fussed over her and Bucky.

""Daddy?"" she asked, popping the door open just far enough to stick her head out. ""Is Steve Pawgers allowed inside? He pooped in the rec room and ruined my Christmas sneakers,"" she reminded him.

""It's fine. All the puppies had a walk back at the lake,"" he assured his little girl.

""Okaaay..."" she drawled, ""but if he poops inside again, Bucky's cleaning it up.""

""Did Bucky say that?""

""No, I did."" She heaved the door open an extra inch and flounced away.

""God."" Pepper threw back her head and smiled at the stars.

""Don't blame him. We made this mess,"" Tony reminded his fiance, stuffing his hands in his pockets, warm and content at the evidence of her happiness as her mind worked thirty steps ahead of him at the speed of light.

""What mess?"" she asked, her eyes and smile soft and just for him. ""This all feels so..."" she rolled her hand, trying to find a word for it.

""Normal? Domestic?"" Tony whispered with mock horror.

""Yes."" She tipped her chin down and closed the short distance between them to press kisses all over his face. ""Yes, to all of it.""

""Yes, we're getting married next week?"" Tony checked when his heart started to race.

""If we keep it simple..."" she trailed off, calculating times and schedules and whatever else went into a wedding Tony knew nothing about. ""I'll get in touch with Carolina in the morning, wish her a merry Christmas, then drop the news in her lap, see what she can help me come up with last minute.""

""The Herreras have a place Upstate, don't they?"" On the Hudson, maybe? He couldn't remember. ""We'll send the jet, if she's free after Christmas. You think she'll do it?""

""For me?"" Pepper tapped her chin and wagged her head back and forth. ""Probably? High profile, secret wedding, with promises of an Instagram announcement and full social media spread to show off her brilliant, last minute genius? I think she can be convinced.""

""Darcy, though..."" Tony worried.

""No one has to know who the children are in the photos,"" she assured him. ""Everyone has children in their wedding, but you should ask Darcy before you assume she'll want to be that involved. She has no interest in wearing a flower girl dress, so that might be a moot point.""

""Oh no?"" Amusement tugged at the corner of his mouth.

""She wants pants and boots,"" Pepper informed him as they opened the chapel door and made their way inside to find Darcy. They needed to tell her the good news.

""Very practical."" Tony nodded, searching the room for his little girl. She stood at the back of the nave on a pew, arguing with Barton and a trio of Howling Commandos about how to train Barky Barnes. Bucky laid on the floor under the pew with his head on a hymnal and a blissful smile on his face, puppies climbing and laying all over him.

""G--"" Pepper choked, taking in the Commandos and Avengers sprawled all over the nave with mugs of steaming cider or laps full of happy pets. ""This place is a zoo.""

""But it's  our  zoo,"" Tony pointed out happily, waving Darcy over.

""What is it, Daddy?"" she asked, bouncing on the toes of her tiny hiking boots. Barky Barnes nipped at her boot laces and circled her feet, growling at the loose loops dangling from her calves. ""Quit it, Barky Barnes."" She tapped him on the nose gently and pointed down.

Barky Barnes planted his rump firmly on the floor, tail wagging so hard, he vibrated with the movement.

For his own part, Tony was so impressed, he stared at the dog for a full minute, speechless.

""Daddy?"" Darcy asked again.

""Step outside with me and your mom for a minute, kiddo. There's something we wanna tell you first.""

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

Darcy doesn't exactly have the best memories of holidays past. She remembers a more difficult time. Nat and Sam know a thing or two about how to help and Darcy's daddy makes a very important list. Then, Darcy's mommy slips and lets the cat out of the bag.

Trigger warning for implied/referenced past child abuse. I am not fucking around with this warning. If reading about someone else's learned response to abuse will hurt you, skip to the second part of this chapter after the second line of snowflakes. Take care of yourself, first, please.

  .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

Darcy remembered winters in California. She remembered cold rain and palm trees, sleeping on a bare, musty-smelling mattress and waking before sunrise in the corner of a strange, chilly apartment. Her mommy left the tiny oven on with the door propped open when she went out to work. Sometimes, her mommy was gone from when Darcy woke up until long after Darcy came in after the streetlights came on, when she made herself a sandwich with white bread and carefully unwrapped a slice of cheese from the packet in the refrigerator with the slices wrapped up individually like bright yellow candy.

Memories of Darcy's other daddy were different, as if she was looking at them in her mind through a window smeared with peanut butter. She remembered the stale cigarette smell and sourness of breath too close and the little spray of spit from someone shouting right there. She remembered the yelling and that she was supposed to hide when it started or there would be pain later.

She didn't ...  quite  remember the pain, but she knew how it should feel if an adult grabbed her by the arm too hard, if they shook her until her teeth rattled, or hit her with the hard part of the back of their hand. She knew how it  should  feel, but she didn't  remember.

She didn't remember much about Christmas, or even much of Hanukkah, but she knew some of her playmates in the motel where she sometimes lived with her mommy celebrated those holidays and talked about Santa and going to see him at the mall to give him their lists. Darcy didn't know what went on a list or how long it should be. She never had a present because of any holiday other than 'Mommy scored', which meant Mommy had money for a few days  and didn't have to be gone all day, and might take Darcy to the diner where they gave her a coloring book and four crayons to use until dinner came on plates too hot to touch at first.

Darcy remembered the other kids riding bikes and she wondered where they came from. She never had a bike or roller skates or a pet chicken like the kids in 3B. She didn't want a pet chicken or a horse. Horses were pretty, but horses meant cops and the cops weren't to be trusted. Not the social workers, either. Darcy remembered the social workers. She remembered her mommy telling the social workers to take the damn kid or get off her back, but they couldn't have it both ways.

Darcy  remembered .

But layered over top of remembering was Tony and Pepper--Mommy and Daddy. Her new Mommy and Daddy, a mommy and daddy like other kids had, who hugged her and tucked her in and kissed her head when she had a bad dream, her mommy and daddy who talked to her about Santa and what she'd put on her list. Darcy ... she still didn't know what she was supposed to put on it. Daddy said maybe she'd like a bike, so Darcy put 'bike' on her list, but she didn't know what else should go on it until she read Bucky's list. He wrote a letter to Santa Claus with Miss Nat's help and covered the whole top of the page with drawings made by Captain Steve and stickers from Bucky's Phonics workbook.

And he made a list.

The list was pages and pages long, mostly all toys, but a few other things: a scooter, a skateboard, a wrist rocket, and a basketball.

With Jarvis' help, Darcy looked up all those things and asked him for ideas--things to add to her list. Jarvis recommended all the popular toys for girls, but Darcy didn't know who most of the characters were. She knew Legos, so she carefully printed 'legos' on her list after 'bike'.

When her new daddy asked for her list, Darcy shook her head 'no'. There were only two things on it, nothing like Bucky's list. Maybe she did it wrong. But Daddy very gently asked Darcy where she put her list, so she showed him the notebook her new mommy gave her to write her letter to Santa. She wrote ""Merry Christmas, Santa. Have a nice day."" Then, underneath her letter, she wrote, ""I like a bike and legos."" After that, she signed her new name, ""Darcy Morgan Stark"".

But when Daddy saw her list, he looked very sad, like she wrote it wrong. Before she could apologize or hide, he squatted down real low. Darcy braced--for what, she didn't know--but there was no sting on her cheek or throbbing pain like there should have been. Her teeth chattered and her eyes watered. She stared at the floor and tried not to shake. Daddy begged her to say what was wrong, but Darcy only shook harder as tears burned her cheeks and she couldn't even see him anymore.

Then, his arms wrapped around her and Mommy's heels click-clicked fast across the floor beside Miss Nat's quieter boots. Miss Nat said a few words as Daddy rocked Darcy and shushed and smoothed her hair. His breath got real choppy and she felt the hot splash of something wet on her forehead. Daddy lifted her up high into his arms and pressed her between him and Mommy. Her teeth wouldn't stop chattering, so she apologized, ""sorry, sorry, sorry"" until she bit her tongue, but then Miss Nat said more words and she kept saying them, over and over, until Darcy understood what some of them meant.

""Mishka, you're safe. No one here will hit. You're safe. Your daddy loves you. Your mommy loves you. No one is angry, Mishka. You're safe. No one will hit,"" Miss Nat said over and over, running a hand down Darcy's back.

Darcy shook her head. ""No, no. It's wrong. It's bad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Daddy. I'll make it better, I promise,"" she swore, hugging herself hard and pressing the bottom of her head under his chin.

""There's nothing wrong with your list, Mishka,"" Miss Nat continued. ""You've never made one before, have you?""

Darcy shook her head.

""And you didn't know how?"" Miss Nat checked again.

Darcy hiccuped and sobbed. ""I'm sorry. I tried, but I don't know how,"" she wailed, waiting for the bite and sting she knew would finally make her be quiet like she was supposed to. Any second now...

""Darcy,"" Senior Air Man Falcon Sam's voice cut in over the noise. ""Your list is just fine. There's no right or wrong way to make a list.""

""It made Daddy not happy,"" she pointed out with a hiccup.

""Give us a second,"" Senior Air Man Sam opened his arms to Darcy.

Without looking at her Daddy or the other adults, Darcy crawled into his arms and clung to his chest real tight.

""Were you afraid of your daddy not being happy?"" Senior Air Man Sam asked.

Darcy glanced at Daddy out of the corner of her eye and nodded real small for Senior Air Man Sam.

""What did you think would happen if your daddy was unhappy?"" Senior Air Man Sam asked very gently.

But Darcy only shook her head. She didn't know what would happen and that was scary.

""Did you think he would punish you?""

Darcy nodded and burrowed into Senior Air Man Sam's chest.

""You know Tony is different than your other daddy, right?""

Darcy nodded.

""Has Tony ever hit you to punish you?""

That made Darcy stop and think real hard. She shook her head.

""Did you get confused?"" Senior Air Man Sam asked, rubbing her back.

She nodded and rubbed her cheek where the knuckles should have bit into it and made it throb with heat and pain.

""You remember being hit for punishment? By your other daddy?"" Senior Air Man Sam asked.

Darcy nodded.

Daddy made a noise like a sad giraffe.

""It's hard, sometimes, trying to remember that how you live now is different than how you lived before, isn't it?"" Senior Air Man Sam asked.

Darcy nodded.

""What did you think you did wrong?""

""My list is bad. It's wrong and bad,"" she whispered, pinching the skin of Senior Air Man Sam's neck. ""I never made one before for Santa.""

""And you think you did it wrong?""

Darcy lifted a shoulder as if to say ""I don't know.""

""Not knowing how someone will react is scary, especially when you remember how other people reacted in a scary or bad way before. Did you think Tony would do that, too?""

Darcy nodded, but her lip wobbled and she started to cry again, pressing her face into his neck real tight where it was warm and safe.

Senior Air Man Sam bounced very gently as he walked in a big circle around the room with Darcy on his hip, rubbing her back. ""I have an idea,"" he said.

""What?"" Darcy sniffled.

""Making your first list for Santa and writing a letter you've never written before must be pretty hard, lots of pressure, huh?"" he continued to walk and bounce and talk real soft just for Darcy.

She nodded.

""What if..."" he drawled, ""...you had some help making your list? We could all sit down together and talk about the kinds of things we asked Santa for when we were little to help you figure out what you want to ask Santa to bring you this year.""

Darcy looked at Daddy out of the corner of her eye. His face was all red and he looked like he was maybe crying, too.

 *""*.,,.*""* 

""Don't worry about Tony right now,"" Senior Air Man Sam said as he walked Darcy right out into the sun room that looked out over the Hulkey rink. The smaller Christmas tree by the breakfast table twinkled with multicolored lights and a paper chain in red and green and white, and all kinds of decorations made by kids Darcy didn't know, and some made by her and Bucky.

""When I was your age, all I wanted was a saucer sled, so I could race the other kids in the neighborhood down the steep hill behind the auto body shop up the street from my house."" Senior Air Man Sam started swaying and Darcy felt a little bit sleepy. ""You ever gone sledding?"" he asked before she closed her eyes.

Darcy shook her head. ""No, but Aunt Peggy sent me a toboggan sled for Christmas, so I could do it if I wanted.""

""We'll have to make time for that, maybe a fun family night when we all go find a spot to play on the mountain and race down the hill. Do you think you'd like that?""

Darcy nodded, real sleepy now, with Senior Air Man Sam swaying like a person-shaped hammock. Darcy closed her eyes.

The next thing she remembered was waking up on the sofa at the far end of the sunroom in Miss Nat's arms. Spread out all over the sofas and chairs and floor, their whole family had notebooks and special stationery and pencils, and sometimes, someone would read a part of their list out loud for suggestions. On the floor by Miss Nat's leg, Daddy sat with a notebook, making a list, too, but his wasn't for Santa.

His list said:


 To-do List 


""What's Daddy doing?"" Darcy whispered to Miss Nat.

""Making a list of ways to teach you about celebrating Christmas, so you'll know how to do it in the future and be less scared when you don't know what to expect. There's no wrong way to celebrate, but everyone learns the traditions as they grow up, like writing to Santa and visiting him at the mall,"" Miss Nat answered, smoothing her hand up under Darcy's hair and hugging her close. ""I had to learn, too. Clint was very patient with me, like your Mommy and Daddy will be with you.""

Daddy added ""visit Santa"" to his list.

""Senior Air Man Sam said we could all go sledding, together,"" Darcy pointed out to Miss Nat.

Daddy tapped that part of his list and turned to smile at Darcy over his shoulder. ""Workin' on it, kiddo.""

Which is how Darcy ended up at the top of the hill behind the chapel after the very late church service on Christmas Eve, smooshed between her Daddy and Senior Air Man Sam on her new toboggan sled, wearing a smaller version of her Daddy's Iron Man helmet. Snow fell, thick and fluffy, all around. Next to them, Bucky sat in Captain Steve's lap inside the captain's shield. Bucky smiled up at Darcy's mommy when she tapped the other Iron Kid helmet in place on Bucky's head. He 'oof'ed and grunted in Captain Steve's lap. On the far side of Captain Steve and Bucky, Darcy's mommy climbed onto a sled behind Miss Nat.

""I hope you know how to steer one of these things,"" she muttered, clipping her own helmet on under her chin.

""Nope!"" Miss Nat called over the noise of the Howling Commandos and Agent Clint, and the puppies carrying on in the woods and waiting their turn to go next. ""Never done it before! How hard can it be?""

Senior Air Man Sam cackled like a villain in a cartoon and told Darcy to hang on tight, putting his hands down on the ground on either side of the sled and pushing and pulling them back and forth. She squeezed his middle real hard, even though Daddy's legs tightened around her to hold her in place.

Captain Steve did the same as Senior Air Man Sam, pulling the shield back and forth until there was a nice, slippery groove in the snow to get them started.

Mommy closed her eyes and buried her face between Miss Nat's shoulders. ""If you put me in a tree a week before my wedding, Nat, so help me...""

""Wedding?"" Miss Nat squawked and spun around as everyone but Senior Air Man Sam turned to stare at Mommy.

The last thing Darcy heard as Senior Air Man Sam pushed off with a ""So long, suckers!"" was a cheer and people shouting congratulations, and Mommy saying all the curse words that got Agent Clint in trouble for teaching to Bucky.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

""But Daddy, I wanna stay awake to meet Santa again,"" Darcy grumbled as Tony and Pepper bundled her off to sleep in the playroom with Bucky where Clint's young, archer friend Kate agreed to keep an eye on the little ones while the adults played Santa downstairs.

""You saw him at the mall on Thursday, remember?"" Tony smoothed back Darcy's hair and pressed a kiss to her forehead.

""But I wanna meet Rudolph now..."" she whined, giving in and letting Tony pull her ugly Christmas sweater over her head to replace it with her holiday Thor sleepshirt. By her side, Bucky complained just as loudly, but squirmed a lot more, so it took both Steve and Nat to wrestle him out of his sweater and into a Hulk PJ onesie.

""Thteebie, whataboutathtory?"" Bucky muttered into the pillows as Steve Pawgers crawled onto the pile of sleeping bags on the dogs' giant bean bag bed and laid over Bucky's face.

""Once upon a time,"" Steve whispered close to Bucky's ear with a soft snort and a mouthful of Steve Pawgers' thick fur, ""little punks from Brooklyn shut up already and went to sleep.""

""No, we didn't."" Bucky grinned his sleepy smartass grin at Steve as Natasha hissed at the older Brooklyn boy to knock it off.

Down the hall, Tony heard Rhodey and Clint heading downstairs with arms full of gifts, swearing at all the bunnies underfoot running from Yasha and Puggy Carter. Then, Sharon showed up in the doorway, laughing, with an armful of wiener dogs, sleepy and slightly flattened in the backpack they'd ridden back in from sledding. Behind Carter, Uncle Dum Dum carried a pig, two more bunnies, and Barky Barnes inside his coat.

""You open a zoo when nobody was looking, too?"" the major demanded, dumping the whole furry, oinking bunch between the kids.

""Not yet, but give him a minute,"" Steve joked under his breath.

""One pony,"" Tony insisted. ""That's it. That's all I wanted to get, but then Nat saw these guys on the inventory list from an FBI raid on a terrorist AIM cell's base."" He gestured to the menagerie on the floor.

Kate shooed the adults toward the door and dimmed the lights, whispering, ""You're lucky if you have three or four hours to finish putting those bikes together before they wake up. Don't stand here arguing. And send Clint up with some eggnog when he's got a minute.""

""How old are you again?"" Tony eyed the younger woman over glasses he'd swear every which way weren't for reading.

The teen rolled her eyes. ""Old enough for a shot of booze in my eggnog if I'm old enough to stay up babysitting the younger kids,  DAD.""

""Bullshit,"" Carter coughed into her fist.

""Dad."" Tony's eyes bugged out of his head, his chest tight with shock. Dad. He was not prepared for that. 

""You know, I could be back in Bed-Stuy at Clint's place, raiding his liquor cabinet right now,"" Kate pointed out.

""You forget--I've seen his apartment."" Nat raised one eyebrow. ""You're here because no amount of liquor could make up for the empty fridge he left behind, so stretch out on the couch and get some sleep. You can have  one  very civilized Bloody Mary or Mimosa with breakfast while we discuss Pepper's wedding plans, if you behave.""

""Fine,"" the teen huffed and collapsed on the couch.

""And I'll take you to that spa at the mall the day after tomorrow, no kids, no Clint,"" Natasha promised.

""YES!"" Pleased with the negotiations, Kate followed Natasha's orders, kicking off her boots and curling up on the sofa under an electric blanket. She lifted one arm and Lucky leapt over the back of the couch to scootch up under her hand.

""Night, Pizza Dog,"" she murmured with a kiss between his ears.

""Night, Pittha Dog,"" Bucky murmured, too, already out of it.

""Night Pizza Dog,"" Darcy repeated automatically, slipping deeper into sleep.

Something crashed downstairs.

""Small fire! Nobody's hurt!"" Clint called from the great room, knocking over everything that wasn't nailed down. ""So help me, Dum-E, if you spray me with tha-- AGHGHGHHH!!!""

""Let's go relieve Barton of whatever led to the fire and get the rest of those drones and bikes put together,"" Natasha whispered to Steve as they bottle-necked at the door and filed out into the hall. ""I've got plans for you later.""

""Oh, yeah?"" Tony averted his eyes when Steve's hands closed over the Widow's very fine leather-clad buttcheeks. ""These plans have anything to do with that new silky green thing I'm not supposed to know you hid in the top drawer?""

""Maybe."" She dragged a fingernail down the line of his jaw.

""If they keep it up, we're going to need Dum-E's fire extinguisher up  here,"" Pepper hissed as she emerged from the hall closet, arms full of gift-wrapping supplies.

""Young love."" Tony winked at his fiance and happily relieved her of half her red and green burden.

""We can wrap in here."" She pointed to the guest room across the hall from their bedroom where they could wrap gifts and keep an eye out for Darcy, in case she came looking for them before sunrise. She handed another two bags off to Sharon and Uncle Dum Dum before leading Tony to the spare room.

When the door clicked shut, Tony turned around in a full circle, looking for the rest of the gifts in need of wrapping before he caught up with the sly grin on Pepper's face as she dumped an armload of wrapping supplies haphazardly on the floor  

""Your uncles wanted to fight over who got to test the drones and finish putting the bikes together, and Peggy promised to keep Barton from setting himself on fire, so I ... took advantage,"" she admitted with her back pressed to the door. ""Everything else is already wrapped, stockings stuffed and hung by the chimney with care,"" she swore, patting the blue light of his arc reactor when he dropped his wrapping supplies, too, and got with the program. ""So we've got a few minutes.""

""We've got three or four hours,"" Tony reminded his love, crowding her against the door.

""Not enough by half, but it's more than we've had in a month,"" she sighed when Tony nibbled a line of stinging bites up the slender column of her throat.

""I don't suppose you've had any deliveries of the silky green kind this week?"" he checked, pulling the neck of her blouse out to peer down. A frothy cream and rose gold confection twinkled back in the low light.

""Not green."" She shook her head, chewing her bottom lip and catching at the button of his pants to start working on them.

""Pepper..."" Tony groaned, closing his eyes against the promise of all that fair skin wrapped in nothing but sheer ivory silk and delicate lace. ""Is that for me?""

""For the next few hours, it is,"" she pledged, thumbing open the top buttons on his gift.

""Oh, no, no."" Tony's hand covered hers. ""Opening my present is the best part.""

For the rest of the early hours of Christmas morning, Pepper proved him wrong.

There were much better parts.

Darcy finds out Agent Clint's been keeping a very big secret, but then again ... so has Darcy.

I pretty much wrote an entire prequel to this story just so I could include this scene and one more like it later on. *sing-songs* I hope you're caught up on the prequel!

 >>=========>

It was still dark when Darcy opened her eyes.

Quietly, she gathered up Thor's cape and her Bucky Bear, and crept out of her sleeping bag on the puppies' bed in the playroom, tiptoeing past Agent Clint's friends, Katie and Pizza Dog. Only... Pizza Dog lifted his head and watched Darcy for a few seconds before slipping off the sofa to walk with her down the hall. Pizza Dog didn't walk like the other dogs. His nails didn't clack-clack on the wood floor. He walked real quiet like Miss Nat, bumping Darcy from time to time to nudge her around a table she couldn't see in the dark or herd her away from a tree-scented candle someone accidentally left burning on the chest of drawers full of extra blankets around the corner from the playroom where the hallway opened into a larger room with chairs and a low table. Senior Air Man Sam sat there with Dr. Bruce, sometimes, drinking hot drinks from big mugs and taking naps after lunch.

First, she peered into her own bedroom, checking that everything was right where she left it when she and Bucky played coffee shop yesterday because Darcy and Bucky didn't wanna play tea party, no matter how many tea sets they found in the old toy chests in the playroom. Her bed was still made, even though she napped in it sometimes when she was up late with Daddy the night before in the shop. Usually, she slept in the big bed with Daddy and Mommy and the puppies. Their room was a few doors down. She almost stubbed her toe and banged up her whole face on the way there, but Pizza Dog suddenly appeared right in front of her and kept her face from smashing the open door.

She peeked inside Daddy's room, but the bed was empty. No Daddy. No Mommy. No doggies. But she heard a noise across the hall, so she hitched Thor's cape up over her shoulder and patted Pizza Dog in thanks for saving her face on the way to check out the noise. The door wasn't closed quite tight, so Pizza Dog helpfully nosed it open.

In the guest room, Darcy's Daddy and Mommy were asleep, snuggled all cozy together in the middle of the bed where Darcy usually slept. There were only a few candles burning low and no night light to see by, with clothes all over the floor, and the blankets didn't cover them all up. Darcy looked away, blinking at Pizza Dog, who smiled his big doggy smile.

""Hey, what're you doing up, Darce?"" Agent Clint whispered from a few feet away, peeking into the guest room when he stopped by her side. ""Uh oh."" He smiled real big and pulled the door closed as he herded them back out into the hallway, giving Pizza Dog a look like he ought to know better.

""I don't know why I woke up,"" Darcy informed her daddy's friend.

""Bathroom?"" he checked, eyeing her suspiciously.

Darcy thought about it. Maybe. She nodded, so Agent Clint picked her up and carried her down the hall to the nearest guest bathroom since she couldn't see so good as him in the dark.

""You need help, or you got this?"" he asked when he set her down inside the bathroom and turned the dial for the nighttime lighting on.

""I can do it,"" she promised, so Agent Clint offered to wait for her in the hallway. When she was all done and washed her hands, there he was, waiting right where he said he would.

""I was gonna go sit in the sunroom and watch the snow. You wanna come with me and watch, too, until you feel sleepy again?"" Agent Clint asked.

That sounded like a good idea to Darcy. She felt too antsy to sleep, so she told him so.

He smiled real big like his doggy. ""That's because it's Christmas. Everybody is too excited to sleep on Christmas.""

""Not Daddy and Mommy,"" she reminded Agent Clint.

He laughed, then poked his cheek with his tongue. ""Well, they had a big day. I heard they're getting married.""

It was Darcy's turn to smile real big. ""Mommy said she'd marry Daddy and become my mommy for real, and we'd be a family forever, and maybe I'll get to be a big sister!"" She bounced in her slipper boots, so super extra excited!

Agent Clint laughed so hard, he choked. ""You should definitely remind your mommy of that part at breakfast in a few hours."" Then, he got impatient with Darcy's very short legs and picked her up for the walk down the stairs. She snuggled him real close and put her face in that same spot where Daddy wore his cologne on his neck above the blue light in his chest.

""You smell nice,"" she said, rubbing her cheek against his soft, warm T-shirt, wrapping her legs around his middle when he unzipped the hoodie to wrap around her and keep her extra warm.

""You're the only one who thinks so, Darce."" He rubbed her back real gently and she started to feel drowsy, petting the silky corner of Thor's cape and squeezing her Bucky Bear between her and Agent Clint. ""You want some cocoa?""

She was about to say 'no' when Agent Clint carried her into the sunroom and the twinkling rainbow lights bounced up down and all around the room in the dark, lighting up the thick blanket of soft snow all over the roof, and clinging to the window panes, and piled up against the outside of the walls.

""Ohh..."" she breathed, reaching out to trace a circle in the little cloud her breath made against the glass when Agent Clint got close enough for her to see beyond the glass. Outside, it looked like something out of a frozen fairy tale. ""It's like magic,"" she whispered.

""Yeah,"" Agent Clint agreed, and she watched him in his reflection, swaying barefoot in front of the glass with Pizza Dog leaning against the front of his legs. He hugged Darcy real close and kissed her head, and the swaying brought Darcy's cozy, sleepy feeling right back, except ... something tickled her nose. Twice.

""Quit it, Agent Clint,"" Darcy muttered, but he didn't quit it.

""Aw, Birdie, no,"" Agent Clint hissed, letting go of Darcy with one hand to pull at something draped over his shoulder from behind his neck.

Darcy blinked her eyes real hard, but when she opened them wide, there was a tiny lizard there, with its very tiny claws digging into the back of Agent Clint's neck.

A tiny lizard  with wings.

""Birdie, we talked about this."" Agent Clint pried the little lizard off of his neck and cradled her against his chest by Darcy's hair. ""Nobody is supposed to know about you,"" he scolded the little lizard.

""What is it?"" Darcy asked, itching to pet its big blue-ish purple ears and glittering grey-blue-purple scales with a fingertip.

Agent Clint sighed. ""If I tell you..."" He made a face, like he wasn't sure he should say anything else. ""She's a secret, Darce. Nobody is supposed to know she's here except me and--""

""What?"" she demanded, giggling when the lizard scrabbled across Agent Clint's hoodie to nudge happily under Darcy's hand for soft pats. It made a whistling noise that sounded like Darcy's name. ""She knows me,"" Darcy realized.

""When you were big,"" Agent Clint explained, crossing the sunroom to settle down under the covers on one of the big, puffy sofas with Darcy and the little lizard (Pizza Dog hopped up after them and curled against Agent Clint's side), ""you and I visited a place called Asgard, where Thor is from, because we were very good friends. While we were visiting, Birdie hatched from an egg in the fireplace. That's how teacup dragons incubate--near a fire.""

""She's a real baby dragon?"" Darcy couldn't even believe it, but Agent Clint pulled something out of his hoodie pocket--a funny ring that fit over two fingers. He used it to open a hole right in the air. Then, he reached through it and pulled out a small squeaker toy shaped like a new penny. Birdie squawked happily and made gimme hands with her claws until Agent Clint handed it over from the magic hole in the air. ""Whoa,"" Darcy breathed.

""It's magic,"" Agent Clint said like he was confessing a secret. Very carefully, he closed the hole so no one could even tell it was there. ""The place where we found Birdie--the people there don't like teacup dragons. They're messy and they make trouble sometimes, so when you were a grownup, we both decided she would stay with me, instead of on Asgard where it's not very safe for her as a baby without a grownup dragon mommy or daddy to keep an eye on her.""

""So you..."" Darcy looked between the little dragon and Agent Clint and Pizza Dog, connecting the dots easily. ""You 'dopted her to keep her safe? Like Daddy 'dopted me?""

Agent Clint smiled real softly and kissed Darcy's forehead. ""Yeah. She probably shouldn't be on Ear--  in New York , so I've gotta keep it quiet for now, you know?""

""So she's a secret?"" Darcy double-checked.

""Yeah, to keep her safe, she's gotta be a secret for now,"" Agent Clint admitted. ""Can you keep a secret?""

She nodded.

""I have a secret, too,"" Darcy confessed, feeling very sneaky now that she was in on Agent Clint's tiny dragon secret.

""What's that?"" he asked.

Darcy reached into the folds of Thor's cape and closed her eyes, wishing real hard. When her palm got real warm, she smiled and pulled back the cape to show Agent Clint what she could do with Thor's cape.

In her hand sat a perfect, tiny kitten, no bigger than Birdie, covered in orange and black tiger stripes just like she wished for.

""Holy shit,"" Agent Clint swore when the tiny kitten opened its mouth and roared like a life sized tiger.

""I named him Tony after Daddy,"" Darcy informed her grownup friend, laying her head on his chest to introduce Tony to Birdie.

Nat talks to her brothers about family.

Merry Christmas! I hope yours is lovely--if you celebrate--and you have an opportunity to spend time with those you love best, be they family or like-minded friends. 

Keep an eye out later today for a second Christmas chapter (if I don't waste the entire day napping and eating candy).

>>=========>

""Good morning!"" Nat called, coming in from her shift running the perimeter and looking through the early hours' security feed since Barton's last check-in at four o'clock.

Usually, he came to trade off with her in person, but with the main lodge bursting with people and nearly a dozen more in the outlying cottages, it was likely he'd become sidetracked and left Nat to wake up with her alarm. Of course Steve woke, too, and insisted on accompanying her for the early morning perimeter check, but she sent him off to see that Bucky's breakfast consisted of more fruit than Nutella with his waffles while she sat down with Maria, who had her hands full vetting security teams for the children, in case they remained children for very much longer.

Thankfully, with the arrival of the Howling Commandos, the team could rely on a few more trustworthy hands with security experience to keep the secret of the children from any curious reporters and photographers, and both groups far enough from the property line to give the children all the room to roam they would need without feeling hemmed in by that invisible boundary. Dernier, Morita, Dugan, and Falsworth all tracked her down during her morning check-in to volunteer their assistance, and she'd gotten texts overnight from Peggy and Gabe, as well as the younger Carter and Rhodes, to offer the same. Split up amongst more than a dozen people, they could easily give Tony a week off the security rota to plan the details of a last-minute wedding with Pepper.

""Mornin'."" Bucky grinned his sweet, toothless grin, dragging his gaze from the coloring book and waffle remnants in front of him up to his big sister's face. ""Thanta came."" He pointed to the empty bottle of Coke and the crumb-covered plate of cookies the children almost forgot to leave out for Santa the night before at bedtime in all their excitement about the holiday.

""I heard he does that most Christmas mornings."" She gave in to the urge to lean over and ruffle his messy bed hair.

""Aw, Nat, quit it,"" he whined for form's sake, but ducked his head to hide his smile at the familiar treatment.

""It's almost noon; if Santa's already been and gone, why are you still at the table?"" she asked, leaning back to peer through the door from the breakfast nook in the sunroom out to the great room, where some of the adults had begun to gather with steaming mugs of coffee and cocoa to search beneath the tree for gifts with their name on the tag.

""Darthy'th thtill thleepin'."" Bucky hooked a thumb over his shoulder at the cozy conversation area at the other end of the long room.

""You're waiting for Darcy?"" Nat was surprised. Christmas had been the only topic of conversation over every meal for more than a week, Bucky and Darcy were so excited.

""I don't mind."" He grinned his darling, toothless grin again and Nat melted.

""You're such a gentleman, James Buchanan."" She pecked him on the lips when he puckered up for the expected kiss every time one of the ladies of the household told him what a precious darling he was being.

""I twy."" He shrugged and returned to his coloring book, sifting it to the bottom of the pile and pulling out a drawing full of crayon renditions of everyone he knew.

""You're missing someone,"" she hinted, checking it over carefully for someone Bucky never would have missed as an adult.

Bucky stared at the page, then flipped open one of the Avengers coloring books on the table to page through.

""Oh,"" he said after a few moments. ""Hawkath."" His cheek dimpled on the word and she couldn't bring herself to correct the little brat.

""Oh, yeah."" Nat rolled her eyes and shook her head.

""He'th thtill nappin', too,"" Bucky added conversationally, scribbling in a comical image of the blond archer in a purple pizza t-shirt to match the one he wore last night (""Live Free, Pie Hard"") between Nat and Darcy, with Pizza Dog by his side.

""Napping?"" Nat turned slightly and tilted her head to get a better look at the sleeping mound of blankets on the sectional at the end of the room. On the floor, a pair of tiny, teal slipper boots sat beside Pizza Dog's favorite tennis ball. Dangling above them, a calloused, mens size eleven foot hung off the couch beside a long, fluffy tail of the golden variety. Nat rose to her feet with a ""Merry Christmas, sweetie,"" for Bucky, and went to investigate.

At the top of the covers, in the corner of the sectional, Darcy's riot of brown curls spilled over the back of the sofa and across the blankets, even covering Barton's sleeping face. Darcy's arms were thrown up over her head where she lay on her back on top of Clint with his arms wrapped carefully around her middle to keep her from tipping off the couch or being crushed against the rear cushions if she rolled one way or the other. The remnants of several servings of Rosa's mocha latte and hot cocoa mix were scattered across the coffee table. Crumbs that looked suspiciously like the ones left out for Santa were scattered across the table, too. Beside one of the mugs, she noticed Clint's hearing aids.

Cautious not to startle him, she touched his wrist. He came immediately awake without any clue to give away his alert state except the slight change in breathing someone less familiar with him would have missed. She waited while he assessed his surroundings before opening his eyes.

""Good morning,"" Nat signed when he blinked awake. ""Trouble sleeping?"" She pointed to Darcy.

Careful to avoid disturbing the sleeping girl, Clint signed, ""She went looking for Tony and Pepper in the middle of the night. Figured they could use the night alone, so I brought her down here to watch the snow fall until she got sleepy again, and..."" He spread his hands out to indicate the late night feast and dozing five year old.

Another brown head of hair popped up from under the covers at the end of the couch. Barky Barnes blinked his sleepy blues eyes at everyone before wiggling loose and worming his way up the covers to snuffle at Darcy.

""You doing okay with all this?"" Nat signed, gesturing at Darcy and back towards the breakfast table, where Bucky sat, drawing a family portrait in crayon.

Barton rolled his lips, thinking over his answer, before he signed his response, ""I just want her to be happy--both of them--whatever comes out of all this.""

""But you miss her,"" Nat signed.

""Always,"" Clint signed back immediately. ""I love this adorable kid like she was my own, but she isn't my best friend. I feel so ... disconnected.""

""You're the only reason there's distance between you. If you explained to Tony and Pepper--""

""That I'm pining for my best friend?"" Clint signed with a snort of derision, breaking eye contact to pat Barky Barnes' butt so he'd settle without waking Darcy.

""That, as someone who loves her, you'd like to play a larger role in her second childhood, to make sure she's as happy and loved as she deserves. You can be more to her than distant, weird Uncle Clint, who juggles and eats too much pizza, and you know it,"" she signed, using every nuance of body language to convey her disappointment in his decision to keep his distance.

""What if I'm not good for her?"" Clint signed after a minute's humming silence.

""According to whom?"" she demanded.

""Me,"" he mouthed, wrapping his arms around the girl and pressing a kiss to the crown of her head.

""And what if you're being too hard on yourself?"" she signed right back. ""What if you could personally see to her happiness and you don't, and she misses out on the experience of knowing and loving you as family now? Or worse: returns to her adult state and ends up confused and hurt by the distance you've kept? Stop overthinking it."" She swatted at his arm. ""She'd be the best Aunt Darcy you ever had, if your positions were reversed.""

At that, Clint smiled. ""Yeah, she would,"" he signed with a resigned nod.

""Do better,"" Nat signed, rising to her feet as Bucky sidled over to show off his completed drawing.

""It's lovely,"" she praised the boy. ""Tell me about it."" She took a seat on the short end of Clint's sectional and raised an arm for Bucky to crawl under for a snuggle.

""Thith ith our famiwy now. I drawed a picthure tho I'd a'member everboby'th nameth."" He pointed to the nuclear family at the front. ""Thith it you and me and Thteebie, and Darthy, her mom, and pop, and thith ith Hawkath."" He tapped the purple scribble with the golden yellow scribble beside it.

""Clint,"" Nat corrected. ""No more Hawkass, no matter how funny you and Sam think it is. Clint is family--""

""Wike I'm ya brovuh?"" Bucky asked, incredulous, unaware Clint had put in his hearing aids to listen in.

""Yes. Before I had you and Steve, Clint and Darcy were my only family. They're very special to me. Clint deserves more respect than you're giving him."" She gave him a gentle squeeze, delighted when Bucky squeezed her right back.

Bucky bit his bottom lip and glanced up at Nat. ""Thorry.""

""Show me you're sorry rather than telling me.""

""How?""

""How would you feel about calling him Uncle Clint?"" Nat suggested.

""Do I hafta?""

""No,"" she assured him. ""But it's a simple way to show respect to an adult, especially one who's such an important part of your family.""

""Why ith he tho impo'tant?""

""A long time ago,"" Nat braced herself to tell the bare bones of the story again, for little ears, ""before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D., I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. For a time, I didn't care who I used it for, or on. I ended up on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar for all the wrong reasons. Clint was sent to ... to kill me. He made a different call.""

""He wath gonna kiww you?"" Bucky's eyes went round like saucers.

""Those were his orders."" Nat shrugged, knowing death would have been kind, under the circumstances. She was doing more than just taking the worst kinds of jobs. She was courting death, daring someone to do what she couldn't bring herself to, at the time, with no one and nothing to live for.

Then Clint blew into her life one day with a bow slung over his back and an offer: a choice.

""Why didn't he?"" Bucky demanded, growing impatient with her silence.

""I couldn't start over like you and Darcy get to by being children again, but I could work to make things right--undo the bad and put some good out into the world before someone else came along like Clint with orders to kill me. He saw that I was sad and alone, and then he showed me that I didn't have to be anymore.""

""Tho..."" Bucky thought long and hard, squeezing Nat extra tight for reassurance. ""He thaved you?""

""He did,"" she confirmed.

""I gueth I could caww him Unca Cwint, thinthe he thaved ya wife and all..."" Then he added one caveat, ""But I thtill get to pway prankth on him."" Clearly this was a dealbreaker.

""Fair enough,"" she agreed easily, then whispered, ""What do you have in mind for the next one?""

""Mith Wotha thaid he keepth drinkin' outta tha pitther of Kool-Aid in the kitthen."" Bucky dropped his voice, so even Clint's hearing aids wouldn't pick up his next words. ""I wath thinkin' 'bout puttin' jewwo in it inthtead,"" he said with a wink.

Bucky finds out there's such a thing as too many cookies, but recovers in time for a big surprise.

One-word prompt: overindulgence

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

""We were thinking you could perform the ceremony, so Rhodey is free to be my best man,"" Darcy's pop told Stevie as Bucky lay on his back inside the train track oval under the big Christmas tree in the great room. The toy train he'd been dying to play with chug-chugged and woo-wooed, but Bucky couldn't even enjoy it right now.

""James?"" Nat called, bending down in her softest soft, purple flannel pajamas that Uncle Clint gave her for Christmas. She glanced around in the higher branches and had to kneel down to peer underneath the branches past the tool set for adjusting his new bike, to look for him.

""Wha?"" Bucky grunted, trying not to upset his belly by moving too much. Steve Pawgers was not helping. He kept snuffling at Bucky's face to get after the cookie crumbs on the floor.

""There are a few of these white chocolate macadamia cookies left, if you'd like one. Pepper saved them just for you. There's chocolate milk, too.""

""Not wight now,"" Bucky whispered, feeling green at the mention of more cookies and chocolate milk. ""Maybe water on.""

Or maybe never.

Bucky wasn't ever gonna even look at another cookie again if he could help it. Not even the pineapple ones. His belly gurgled in protest.

""Are you feeling alright?"" Nat pressed her face to the carpet just beyond the ring of branches and lights.

""No,"" Bucky admitted sadly, feeling real sick and sorry for himself. Why'd he eat all those cookies?

""Oh, sweetheart."" Nat made a sad face at him, then turned to speak to someone over her shoulder. ""He's not feeling well, Steve-- No, no. I don't think you can squeeze under. Maybe Butterfingers could..."" her voice trailed off as she debated how to retrieve Bucky from under the tree without upsetting his stomach any more than it already was and Bucky just had to tune her out because moving sounded terrible.

""I got 'im. Hey, kid,"" another grownup voice said a minute later, ""stay where you are. Just be a sec."" The tree branches shivered overhead and a few pine needles fell. Then, Bucky's Uncle Clint was there, wriggling on his belly over the train tracks with a small basin and a pillow. He handed Bucky the basin and carefully slid the pillow under Bucky's head so he could turn on his side. ""Just stay right here for a bit. It'll pass.""

""How'd ya know dat?"" Bucky grumbled, crabby and cranky as he'd ever been in his whole life. He clutched his belly and rocked on his side, leaning over the basin as sweat ran down his back and neck and Steve Pawgers licked him again.

""Me and Pizza Dog once split a three-week-old stromboli and we survived."" He sort of shrugged, but he pushed Steve Pawgers away towards someone else on the other side of the tracks who offered to help, so that was something, at least. ""All you had was too many cookies.""

""I'm nebuh toucthin' cookieth again,"" Bucky swore, and he meant it, too.

""Yeah, that's what we all say."" Uncle Clint smiled extra big and wriggled some more until he was close enough to rub Bucky's back under the tree near the big red stand full of yucky water and pine needles. (Usually, he loved playing with his Matchbox boats in the water under the very big tree, but not so much today.) The rubbing didn't help Bucky's belly much, but it was a nice distraction for a few minutes and he felt a little better just for having company and a grownup so close in case he started feeling even worse. Bucky leaned into the archer's whole hand on the next pass down his neck and shoulders, and Uncle Clint took the hint. He rubbed Bucky's back more firmly for a long time until his upset belly settled.

""Better?"" Uncle Clint checked after a while, when Bucky quit rocking so much to make his belly better.

Bucky nodded. ""Why you bein' tho nithe when I wath a bwat befo'?"" Bucky felt real bad about calling him Hawkass all those times now.

""Everybody's a brat when they're six."" Uncle Clint propped himself up on his hand and kept rubbing Bucky's back real gentle like. ""I overheard you talking to Nat this morning.""

""Oh."" Bucky turned his head, relieved when his belly didn't empty itself all over under the tree. ""Thorry abou' that. I'm weal gwad ya wike Nat'th brovuh. Thee needth ta hab a famiwy, too, wike I got and wike Darthy got.""

""I heard Darcy's gonna have even more family soon,"" Uncle Clint said with a smile, just rubbing and rubbing Bucky's back for what felt like forever.

""Ith Mith Peppuh habbin' a baby!?"" Bucky yelped when he realized what Uncle Clint said.

All the noise in the great room stopped like somebody yanked the needle off a Victrola.

""Uh oh. Did I wet da cat outta da bag?"" Gosh, Bucky's voice was awful loud in the suddenly quiet room.

""No, Bucky, it's fine,"" Miss Pepper said through the Christmas tree. It sounded like she was laughing. ""A wedding is plenty of excitement all on its own without a baby on the way.""

""--Christ. Almost had a heart attack,"" Tony's voice filtered through the pine needles next.

""But..."" Darcy whined. ""I told Santa I wished real hard for a baby brother or sister for Christmas.""

Uncle Clint clapped a hand over his mouth to keep in the big laugh that wanted to escape. Bucky wondered if Uncle Clint knew what Bucky knew about what happened sometimes when Darcy made a wish while she was wearing Thor's cape.

""One Ironlette is enough for now, don't you think?"" Tony asked, then he called louder, like he wanted to make sure Bucky could hear him. ""In fact, when those cookies settle, you should come on out here so you can see your surprise.""

Surprise? Bucky loved surprises.

Bellyache forgotten, he rolled over and army-crawled out from under the tree with his archer uncle not far behind. Just as he crawled clear, Stevie was there waiting with a bottle of kids bellyache medicine in watermelon flavor. Bucky took three. You could never be too conserbative when it came to medicine flavored like candy.

""What is it, Daddy?"" Darcy asked over by the fireplace, dancing on her tiptoes to try to reach the thing he held over her head.

""Hang on, hang on,"" he laughed, flicking on a switch in the bright silver thing he held that looked like Thor's winged helmet toy that Darcy wore all the time since Uncle Clint gave it to her. ""It's a scaled-down version of the Iron Man helmet, made just for you, with a HUD that--""

""What's a HUD?"" Darcy interrupted, grabbing for the extra-shiny Thor helmet and plunking it on her head. ""Oh..."" she said, as if something real special was inside the helmet when an orange-y colored mesh screen flashed across the face part of the opening in the helmet. Barky Barnes barked at the ends of Thor's cape twirling across the stone part of the floor as Darcy turned in circles, looking around at some somethings only she could see.

""HUD stands for Heads Up Display,"" Tony explained, clipping metal things on Darcy's arms that opened and curved between her fingers and wrapped up high around her elbows. Dum-E pushed a pair of metal boots up real close behind her that opened automatically and closed over her slipper boots, wrapping up her legs to the knee, making her gasp at the feel of the cold metal around her knees.

""These,"" he pointed to a second set of hand and leg things in a crate, ""are for you, Bucky.""

Darcy's pop's other robot, U, and Darcy's Uncle Rhodey pulled out a black helmet shaped like Stevie's Captain America cowl. The bot offered it in its claw towards Bucky. On the front of the shiny, black half-helmet, there was a thin outline of a red hourglass shape just like the one on Nat's uniform belt. The hand and leg things in the crate were black, too, with red stripes going down the sides to match the design on the helmet.

Darcy's helmet was a little different. A collar thing appeared out of the bottom of it and her pop showed her how to wrap Mr. Thor's cape over her shoulders so the collar would gather up the slack and make it into a small, Darcy-sized cape.

Clumsy as ever, Butterfingers pulled the other hand and leg things out of the crate and lifted them, one awkward claw at a time, to offer to Bucky, who stuck his arms and legs out as the bot prompted him for each one.

""Now, inside the house, the Ironlette boots have much more limited capabilities: plain boots or rollerblades, mostly. To really see what the boots can do, we gotta go outside."" Darcy's pop waggled his eyebrows and made a hand motion like Uncle Clint's sign language in front of Darcy's Heads Up Display.

Her shiny silver boots lifted an inch or two off the floor and she started rolling towards the door, laughing, ""Daddy! I'm not a robot!""

""Nope, you're Iron Kid.""

""What'th that make me?"" Bucky demanded to know as Uncle Clint made the same motion as Darcy's pop and Bucky started rolling towards the door, too. ""Hey, I'm tawkin' hewe!""

""The Iron Sidecar!"" Darcy's pop called after him as Bucky's boots rumbled onto the porch and towards the front stairs.

""Uh oh."" Bucky didn't like where this was going at all. He tried to stop, but the boots just kept on going until he teetered on the top stair and the things on his hands forced his fingers back at a weird angle. Darcy's Uncle Rhodey popped the half-helmet on Bucky's head and the HUD lit up like Christmas lights, showing Bucky all kinds of neat stuff inside the mask. Jarvis' voice warned him to brace himself. Then, a white-blue light got real bright in the middle of each of his hands and his arms shook as the lights pushed against the things wrapped around his arms. The feel of the porch under his feet fell away and more lights shined from the bottom of his boots. He drifted into the yard, maybe four or five feet above the ground, as Jarvis steered him over to Darcy hovering in the front yard, too, with her cape billowing majestically like a magical unicorn's hair in the wind.

""Howy cow,"" Bucky whispered. ""I can fwy.""

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

See, the thing Bucky knows about Christmas is ... a fella might get all kinds'a fun stuff, but it's too cold to ride your brand new bicycle or jump on your new trampoline, and too windy for your new r/c drones, and all your new toys are in boxes that a fella can't even open without an adult and scissors and a special college degree in unstickin' that sticky stuff on the back of boxes tape, so once you unwrapped all'a your new stuff from Santa, you're pretty much stuck waitin' on the growedups to open boxes with safety cutter things and put in the right batteries, and then there's not even anything fun to do while you wait.  

TL;DR: Bucky is bad at waiting.

Many, many thanks to my awesome beta babes, phoenix_173 and Zephrbabe, both of whom make every single update on this fic possible.

 .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

Gosh, Bucky sure did love his swell, new Iron-Widow boots and all.

When it got too cold to play outside, everybody headed into the dining hall for coffee and the little colored cookies that melted right in your cocoa and warm milk--the ones Bucky usually loved so much. Only... Bucky had enough of cookies for a while, so he decided to do some exploring. Jarvis promised to keep an eye on him when he tried to go up past the third floor and a real quiet warning sounded in the house that Bucky was too many feet above the ground in his special boots. Uncle Clint came along to check on him, but he didn't say Bucky couldn't continue up the stairs behind the playroom, so Bucky figured it must be okay.

(Darcy was havin' a nap. She ran into a tree while they were playing Iron-tag out in the yard--not hard, but Stevie said it maybe scared her and she needed cuddles and some time with her Mommy and Daddy and her Bucky Bear to feel better. And that's why everybody started making loud yawns and talking about how chilly they were, and making the cookie face at Miss Rosa about the coffee.)

""Hey, Jarbith?"" Bucked asked the ceiling where he figured Jarvis' circuits and motherboardy parts lived in the house.

""How may I assist you today, Master Barnes?""

""Doeth thith houthe hab any thecwet pathageth or, wike, fun pwaceth fo' kidth to pway?""

""Does the playroom on the second level not meet your requirements, Master Barnes?""

""Nah, it'th okay, jutht... Me an' Darthy pwetty much pwayed wif all'a toyth aweady. It'th mothtly jutht got dem thixth tea thetth and fanthy-fun dweth-up clotheth, and me and Darthy don't wanna pway tea pawty.""

""Yet you received many new toys and gifts just today, young sir.""

""Yeah, but..."" Bucky lifted a shoulder like Stevie sometimes did when he was trying to find a better word or somethin'. ""They'we all thtill inna boxtheth and it'th too cold fo' widin' ou' new biketh and pwayin' onna new twampowine.""

Bucky sighed. Trying to explain to the house robot was real hard--how he was itchy and crawly under his skin to just  do  something. How was he apposed to esplain?

""Do you mean to say you're restless from lacking physical activity, Master Barnes?""

""Um, yeah, maybe dat."" Bucky lifted one booted foot and the greaves readusted on 'im, fitting closer to his shins and around his feet so he could climb the stairs better. ""I wath jutht finkin' about havin' a wook awound, you know? It'th a weal big houthe and we ain't eben theen all ob it yet. What'th upthtairth?""

""To which level are you referring, young sir?""

""Um..."" Bucky screwed up his lips and scratched his head under his Iron-Widow helmet. ""How many lebelth are dere?""

A nifty 3D hologram of the Lodge at Camp Stark appeared in front of Bucky. He poked at all the walls and rooms, and pulled on the edges of the hologram like he saw Tony do sometimes, so he could peek into the rooms up real close and see what all of 'em were for. As he touched each one, Jarvis explained:

""The Lodge at Camp Stark is comprised of seven primary levels of living space for its capital residents. Below the main lodge level, there are four sub-basement levels and one full basement level, with a secondary adjunct on sub-level four containing a secure wine vault and silver-polishing room. A tertiary adjunct on the basement level provides access to a root cellar as well as cool seed storage. Armories and panic rooms can be found on all full, sub-, and half-levels, while an underground shooting range and its accompanying outdoor long range are both connected to sub-level two by way of Camp Stark's underground tunnel system. A retired fallout shelter is also accessible via the basement level tunnel accessway.""

Bucky was about to ask Jarvis a question when the house started talking again, filling in Bucky on the rooms he hadn't even got to pointing to yet on the hologram:

""Above the seven primary floors of living space, the lodge hosts several half-levels, so-named due to their much lower ceilings and reduced scenic views. These include a staff accommodation level with dormitories for single staff members as well as seasonal staff; another half-level of married and family staff suites, long term, single staff studio apartments, and an uninhabited majordomo apartment; as well as staff recreation areas considered strictly off-limits to capital residents of the lodge such as yourself.""

Bucky blew out an annoyed breath. So a bunch of fun stuff was probably locked up tight and wouldn't let him in without the fancy finger locks he hadn't figured out how to pick. Yet.

""Above these half-levels, the lodge has two additional attic half-levels, home to long term and seasonal furniture and decor storage, primarily, with climate-controlled archive, art storage, and trunk rooms, the doll room, a schoolroom, the lodge's original nursery, the nursery dining room, nursery staff suites, a nursery staff sitting and dining room, a food preparation area for the nursery, a gift-wrapping room, sewing and fitting rooms, a climate-controlled, textile and linen storage room, and an overflow trunk room that has never been used to hold anything but a pingpong table Sir and his young friends haven't used since the early nineteen-eighties.""

Bucky blew out another breath because, boy, oh boy, that was a lot of rooms he probably didn't much care about, but some of 'em sure sounded like they might be fun to poke around in while he was waitin' for Christmas dinner to be ready. Stevie and Nat had snuck off for the coffee before Bucky even reached the front door with Darcy earlier, but by the time he climbed the grand staircase, their bedroom door was closed and locked from the inside. Yasha, Puggy Carter, and four bunnies sat outside the door, just starin' at it, but Bucky had learned his lesson the hard way. You couldn't even pay him  in cookies  to open a closed door knowin' Stevie and Nat were behind it,  especially  if it was locked.

""There are also, of course, the secret passages,"" Jarvis interrupted Bucky's amemberin'.

That sure got a fella's attention. He looked up from the holodoohickey.

""Tell me mo' about dethe thecwet pathageth, Jarbith...""

Bucky learns to never hork your cookies into a wicker wastebasket in this chapter, among other things, but he wants you to know that wicker advice is solid and should not be dismissed lightly.

I hope you all don't mind that updating this fic has become something of a holiday tradition. I'd hope to work on it this summer, but I had some heart problems in June that made it very difficult to write, followed by a lot of anxiety in the months since that made writing humor even more difficult. I never forgot about this story, but I did prioritize and decide to work on this when I'm at my best and can give it 100% of my time and effort. I sincerely hope the many updates I'm planning to post this month live up to the long wait. You've been very patient, for the most part, and I appreciate every supportive and encouraging note you've left on this story without demanding more updates or adding more undue anxiety to the pressure I'm already putting on myself to post more regular updates. It means the world to me to have that kind of fandom support. Thank you.

It's been a while since last Christmas; let's see if I still remember how this goes. ;-)

As Bucky climbed the back stairway, Jarvis must'a noticed how hard it was for him to climb the stairs in his Iron-Widow suit. The booster boots and gauntlets retracted and folded up even tighter to real small bands around his wrists and ankles. If he had a long-sleeve shirt or a jacket on with his jeans when he went out somewhere, nobody could even tell he wore the gauntlets and boosters the way they folded up so small and neat under his clothes. And they were comfortable, too! Even the cowl helmet he wore folded up real small until he was just wearing something that felt like sunglasses or real fancy goggles.

Tony sure did a swell job designing Bucky's Iron-Widow playsuit. Bucky wondered if he'd be allowed to help in the shop when Tony decided to fiddle with the designs again. Bucky loved Tony's shop and playin' with the bots and all. It was like the comic books come to life, the ones him and Stevie used to look at together.

If only Bucky could learn to behave himself better and not get put in the taped off kidzone with the bots for touchin' stuff he oughtn't oughta.

At least he didn't have to wear a Dunce cap like Dummy. That bot was always gettin' into scrapes in the workshop and got put in timeout in the kidzone even more than Bucky and Darcy all put together.

Bucky sighed. He missed playin' with little Stevie and all the good times they had playin' stickball out behind the church on Saturdays when the other fellas didn't give Stevie too hard a time about his wheezin'. Not that playin' coffee shop and buildin' robots with Darcy and the bots wasn't just as good'a fun, but ... Bucky missed a lot of things about Brooklyn.

His ma, for starters. His pop, too. And they just brought him home a baby sister not so long ago, except ... the way he figured, it must'a been a real long time ago now, since he was a growedup before the accident that made him six again.

""Jarbith?"" Bucky asked as he reached the fifth residential floor and wandered down the hall towards the room with the blinking cursor on his heads up display. Inside, the room was neat as a pin. It looked like a dormitory or somethin', like the ones the kids who lived in the orphanage slept in when Steve and Bucky went over after school to play jacks with Otter MacAdams. (Sometimes, Bucky wondered what happened to Otter, too, and if people still called him Otter as a growedup or used his Christian name all formal and fancy-like.)

""Yes, Master Barnes?"" Jarvis replied, flashing a light from the HUD on the catch to pop open a cabinet Jarvis promised led to a passageway to all the good stuff in the attic. Bucky eyed the weird capsule inside that looked like it come right outta the comics like Darcy's pop's workshop.

""Remin' me water,"" Bucky said, stepping into the capsule with an arm braced outside to keep it from closing before he was ready. ""I wanna know what happened ta my baby thithter, Webecca Barneth. Thtebie neber thaid anything about her thpethificawwy. I hope thhe'th okay.""

After a long pause, Jarvis replied quietly, ""She lived a good life, young sir, and was a celebrated soldier, and SSR and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in her own right.""

Bucky's lip wobbled. ""My wittle baby thtithter'th gone, too?""

""I'm so very sorry, Master Barnes."" And Jarvis somehow sounded sad even though he was just a robot house. ""Records indicate she died in the early nineteen-sixties after a difficult battle with a form of cancer that would likely still be termed very rare today. The records show Sir's father, Howard Stark, used many of Stark Industries' medical resources to try to help S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Rebecca Barnes at the request of her former supervising officer, Major Dugan, but the cancer was advanced and her time was much too short for the work needed to find a cure for her rare cancer type. That work continues at Stark Industries to this very day.""

Swallowing the lump in his throat, Bucky bowed his head and said a quiet prayer for his baby sister. He wasn't so good at prayers, but Mother Evelyn, who Bucky met at Miss Pepper's church, said what you mean to pray for was more important than sayin' your prayers real perfect-like during the family service, so Bucky just prayed his baby sister was happy now in heaven with their ma and pop, and Stevie's folks, too, and not in any pain from the cancer no more, and that she got a chance to play with his favorite wagon and ride his bike in heaven since he maybe, might have not let her play with it when they growed up together because he didn't know for sure on account of him forgettin' everything since he was six last time. And then he added another prayer that she had a real nice Christmas with all their folks in heaven, and got to have a real good, fun time playing with the little Baby Jesus in his Christmas manger in God's stable in heaven full'a donkeys and fuzzy sheep and probably some cows. That would be swell, too.

""Amen."" He nodded his head once. That would do for now. And maybe he could talk to Stevie about makin' a novena for Becca later like his ma would've. Stevie could help him figure out what to say when he prayed the novena. He stood quiet for a minute, thinking about how much fun him and Stevie and his baby sister might'a had on Christmas when he was six last time, even though she was still just a squishy baby. He hoped him and Stevie ate oranges from their Christmas stockings and sang carols and had dinner and cookies together. It was harder to remember what happened the last Christmas when he was only five--practically a baby, too--so he decided right then and there to write it all down later after he talked to Stevie, so he wouldn't ever forget again.

With all that big stuff carefully sorted out in his head, Bucky returned his attention to his solo adventure to the attic.

""Jarbith, teww me again what thith thing doeth when I cwothe the doorth?"" Bucky kept one hand carefully braced outside the capsule to keep it from closing automatically. It bumped his arm over and over again and he was startin' to get real sore at it because it wouldn't quit it.

""The tube containing the capsule is powered simply by a vacuum system, similar to what is used in a neighborhood bank drive-thru to transport paperwork from one location to another. There is plenty of air within the capsule and an emergency life support system is contained within, as well. In the event of an emergency, the life support system will trigger automatically and the capsule will coast to the next closest departure point where you may evacuate once the capsule door has cleared the opening.""

""When'th the watht time thomeboby uthed the tubeth?"" Bucky wanted to know, just to be sure it was real good and safe.

""Agents Barton and Romanova have both tested the tube system since your family's arrival at Camp Stark, as well as walked nearly every foot of secret passage and hidden hallway in the house. There remain a few they haven't located, but, per their wishes, I haven't yet disclosed those passages to either of them as they enjoy the challenge of locating all of the passages themselves.""

So ... Nat and Uncle Clint did this, too? NEAT. Bucky wondered where this tube would take him, but before he got a chance to ask, his hand slipped and the capsule door closed and he  whooshed!  away from the little splash of light outside the guest room as the cabinet door closed on its own and the capsule whisked him the last few floors straight up. His belly dropped all the way to his knees and he sat down hard on his butt as the inside of the lodge's walls whistled past at the speed of light. Before he even had a chance to scream with excitement, the capsule coasted to a stop and Bucky tumbled out, falling to his knees and scrambling for the nearest container to puke up his cookie-heavy guts into.

Holy moly, what a ride, Bucky thought, swiping a sleeve across his mouth and sprawling on his back beside the... He glanced above and behind his head and winced as puke seeped from the bottom of the wicker wastebasket he horked into.

""Yuck,"" he grimaced, rolling away so nothing gross got on him.

On the HUD, Jarvis showed him the two cleaning drones the house robot dispatched and warned Bucky to roll clear of the capsule exit. Less than a minute later, two cleaning drones shaped like a lady's hatbox zoomed out of the same capsule. They bagged the wastebasket for removal, mopped and disinfected the floor with their tiny scrubber feet, and cleared a path for the bulky, slow-moving body of U, who brought Bucky a portable sick bag and a little baggie holding two of the same bellyache pills he took hours ago. Obediently, Bucky chewed them up while U watched with his camera lens eyeball. Then, Bucky tried to be helpful by lifting the two drone bots into U's cargo bin along with the bag holding the yucky wicker wastebasket. With a beep and a wave of his claw, U retreated down the hall to the nearest service elevator and disappeared behind the doors.

And Bucky was all alone again with Jarvis on the top floor of the lodge.

Turns out... Bucky loved the attic. It was just bustin' with lots of fun stuff for a fella to poke around in and explore now that his belly wasn't rollin' from so many cookies.

Jarvis told him the room the capsule dumped him into was one of the primary attic storage rooms for seasonal furniture like outdoor tables and chairs and summer lanterns and outdoor heaters and things.

Bor-ing.

""Where'the fun thtuff, Jarbith?"" Bucky demanded, squeezing between two stacks of chairs. A tower of tiny outdoor tables and empty ashtrays clattered to the floor. ""Whoopthieth. Thorry, Jarbith.""

""It is of little concern, young sir. I've dispatched a crew of six housekeeper bots to the attic to tidy up any further messes today.""

""Thankth!"" Bucky crowed at the nearest speaker thing for Jarvis' sound system and followed the cursor Jarvis displayed on the HUD showing him the easiest way through all the piles of stuff to the nearest fun room. There was a pair of double doors in a wide archway just ahead at the end of a long, shadowy hallway. The archway was made of wood, carved with all kinds of silly, cartoon forest animals, all piled up on top of each other like they were a totem pole, balancing the big, heavy branch overhead that made up the curved part of the archway. At the very top, just off-center, a group a fat, happy birds sat on the thick branch. Above them, musical notes were painted right on the wall, as if the birds opened their mouths and sang a whole song, music stave and all. Bucky was surprised to realize he recognized the song, humming a few bars of it as best he knew how from the memory of his ma learning to play it just from his da humming it for her. She even made up a little bit of sheet music from it for their old piano, so Bucky could learn all the notes, too, when she started teaching him to play.


 ""Toora Loora Looral"". 


She sang it to Bucky all the time when he was only little.

""This is the former nursery, young sir. As you indicated a certain restlessness and dissatisfaction with the available toys in the modern playroom, you may enjoy investigating the toy trunks in this room. Be warned however, this nursery has been out of service since before Sir's father refurbished the property in the early nineteen-fifties. And the Lodge sat rarely used by its former owners for twenty-five years before that, as well.""

Bucky scratched his head and did some quick math. ""Tho... The toyth are weal old, huh?""

""I suspect the newest toys in this room would have originated in the mid-nineteen-twenties, young sir.""

Bucky smiled real big. ""That'th pewfect, Jarbith!""

He whooped and threw the nursery doors open, standing in the wide doorway for a minute, looking around for a light or something. Jarvis helpfully traced the HUD cursor over to the toggle on the wall. But ... not a toggle switch like in some of the rooms downstairs. This one was real familiar. There were two black buttons in the middle of the cold, cast iron switch plate decorated with flowers. He tapped the top button and the overhead light flickered on with a familiar hum like home.

Like Brooklyn tenements and shoddy buildings, and all the things Bucky really sorta missed.

But for the first time in a long time, Bucky felt like he  belonged  someplace, too, standin' in that room at the top of the Lodge, surrounded by all the things he remembered so good. An old rocking horse and a baby pen sat along one wall lined with low bookcases. In front of the bookcases, there were small chairs and tables--kid sized--for playing games. In a room separated from the main nursery by another wide archway supported by carved, cartoon animals, one longer table somewhere between kid and adult sized was set up like a dining table opposite the door to the connecting nursery kitchen. There was even a china hutch in the small dining room, outfitted with fun dishes covered in animals just for kids and a long sideboard filled with dusty serving dishes and gravy boats and funny jelly servers and drinking cups and things Bucky only vaguely remembered from Sunday dinners at his gran and popop's, all in the same silly animal designs.

On the other side of the large nursery, small iron beds sat all in a row on the wall near the windows looking over the rundown treehouse on the island in the middle of the lake, with a pair of baby cribs at the very end of the row of beds. When Bucky tugged the dust covers free, he found each bed and crib was made up with a matching child-sized counterpane with the words ""Camp Stillwater"" embroidered on it neatly in a fine hand like Stevie's ma's above a patchwork scene that looked just like the Camp Stark Lodge with the sun setting behind the mountains on the west side of the lake. Images of animals with pink cheeks and big cartoon eyes and lashes peeled from the walls and furniture and toy boxes like old, dried up stickers or wallpaper--Bucky wasn't exactly sure.

But the toy trunks...

Bucky crossed the room to kneel at the end of the first bed, flipping open the catch on the old toy box there and throwing back the lid to peer inside.

It was full of real great stuff! Right on top, there was a whole mess of swell comics!

Buck Rogers, Superman, Flash Gordon... Wow. Bucky never heard of Buck Rogers  or  Flash Gordon and he only knew a little bit about Superman because of Falcon Sam, but the pictures inside promised hours of fun adventures and X-ray glasses if he could read all the words. He tidied up the stack and set it aside to carry downstairs later. A helpful housekeeping bot rolled up by his side with a carton and a lid just as he was about to start poking around in the toy trunk again.

""Jarbith?"" he checked in with his babysitter to see what the little bot wanted.

""Place anything you wish to take to your room or the playroom in this box and U will return to carry it for you when you've finished exploring for the day,"" Jarvis told him, so Bucky set the comics inside the box and left the top off for now in case he found more neat stuff to borrow from the nursery.

Under the top layer of comics, he found a heap of die-cast toy cars, a yo-yo, a bag of marbles and one of jacks. And under all'a that--a real nice, genuine leather baseball mitt and a ball. It was broken in and everything!

""Wow,"" Bucky breathed, tugging the mitt on over his left hand and smacking into it with his fist like a real perfessional ballplayer. He couldn't hardly believe his good luck!

Then, in the next toy box, he found an erector set and a chemistry kit!

""The chemistry kit appears to contain ingredients that could prove harmful without proper supervision,"" Jarvis warned Bucky. The instructions inside the case  did  promise plenty of fun explosions if he did the science right.

Jarvis made a sound like clearing his throat.

Bucky sighed and set the chemistry set in another box provided by a different bot. A third bot trundled over to write in marker on the box, ""Adult Supervision Required"". Then it covered the whole box in warning stickers and wrapped it in the kind of sticky tape Bucky needed an adult's help to open. Darn it.

But maybe Tony would let him blow stuff up with the chemistry kit in his workshop.


 Did Tony count as an adult? 


Bucky would ask Miss Pepper. She was the most growedup person Bucky knew (and she reminded him a lot of his ma with her pretty, light reddish hair and freckles).

Either way, Bucky felt real lucky he found so much good stuff so far, but that's where his good luck ran out. The last three toy boxes all had paper dolls and babydolls in 'em and Bucky didn't have a lot of use for babydolls. He was keepin' the jump ropes from 'em, though. Darcy might like to jump with him sometime, after the snow melted. He piled it all up in the first box provided by Jarvis and tapped the lid in place. He was real tempted to grab one of the comics and sprawl out on a bed up here to read for a few hours, but then he might miss out on explorin' more of the attic while Stevie and Nat were busy.

Hitchin' up his jeans so he'd quit steppin' on the hems, he poked around the rest of the room, but decided to leave the board games and books where they were. Maybe on another snowy day, him and Darcy could bring some snacks up here and play games at the checker table with the board built right into the wood. She read real good, too, so she might like ta come up here and pick some books and sprawl out on the beds and read together.

Bucky couldn't help but wonder why him and Darcy had separate bedrooms when the kids who used to live here all slept in the same one. He asked Jarvis.

After a long pause, Jarvis replied, ""As only your immediate Avengers family is in residence, the many rooms originally set aside for children have been rendered obsolete and out-of-date, especially in the years since it has become more commonplace for children to have their own, individual spaces.""

Bucky sighed. That's what he figured, but ... it sure would be nice sometimes, just to have a place to go where there weren't a bunch of adults playing video games and carrying on when he wanted some quiet to tell secrets to Darcy and she could tell 'em back. So he told Jarvis that, too.

""With your permission, I will bring your concerns to Sir. I believe a compromise can be reached, allowing you and Miss Stark both your own private spaces and one free from most adult interference.""

""Wike a cwubhouthe?"" Bucky asked, not sure if he should get his hopes up or not. He loved when Uncle Clint and Sam and the Howlies all came to the playroom to play Mario Kart, but they sure got loud sometimes.

""Something like that, yes,"" Jarvis answered.

""Huh."" Bucky scratched his butt and bent over to lift the box of his stuff and set it on top of the housekeeping bot Jarvis assigned to follow him. ""Where to nextht, Jarbith?""

Bucky followed the blinking cursor on the HUD back out to the hallway. He ducked into a few rooms--Doll Room, first.


 Boring. 


Also: creepy.


 PASS. 


He ducked into the old schoolroom next, but that was less fun. Darcy would have loved it with its six tiny desks and the little coal stove in the corner that probably kept things real toasty up here so a kid could curl up in the window seat and read a good comic or color in a coloring book. Darcy, he decided, would like the reading nook with the window seat best of all. On the blackboard at the front of the room, letters and numbers were printed and written in the fancy cursive across the top. Under that, all over the blackboard, there were chalk drawings and writing. Three names appeared at the end of a complicated coded number message Bucky couldn't figure out. The names written there were Tony, Rosa, and Muriel.

Bucky wondered if the Tony who wrote on the blackboard was Darcy's pop when he was a kid, too.

Filing that question away for later, Bucky followed Jarvis' blinking cursor to a cabinet behind the larger tutor's desk at the end of the room. Bucky poked the cabinet where Jarvis said he oughta and the door swung open to reveal--


 Another secret passage! 


""Goth, Jarbith, thith thure ith thwell. Thankth fo' thowin' me all thethe fun, thecret pathageth today,"" Bucky gushed, grinning at the gaping hole in the wall before him. ""I'dda never found 'em all on my own.""

""It is a pleasure, Master Barnes. I've found young Miss Stark enjoys exploring the less-traveled corners of the Lodge, as well. It brings me ... a kind of joy to explore the building from your perspective. I've already identified thirteen access points to be addressed by Security Director Hill on your outing today.""

Bucky grimaced.

House robots sure could suck all the fun out of a grand adventure.

""Ith it anotha capthule tube thingy?"" Bucky asked, opting to ignore Jarvis' overprotective tendencies as he peered into the hole at the back of the cabinet.

""No, young sir. This particular passage is exit-only. Agent Barton has confirmed this exit is a fully functioning chute. Though the walls of the trough are quite high to either side, the trough has been waxed to improve performance at some point in its history, and it is recommended you keep your hands in your lap as the incline is quite steep. This chute is engineered in every way to propel the user rapidly to the first level.""

""Gee whithz,"" Bucky burst with excitement. ""What are we waitin' for?"" he hollered, grabbing the top edge of the cabinet and swinging himself inside feet-first onto the slide with a screaming,  ""WEEEEEeeeee.....!!!"" 

""What are we waiting for, indeed, young sir,"" Jarvis sighed to no one whosoever.

Any guesses where the chute leads? ;D

Bucky accidentally finds Clint pretty much exactly where one would expect to find Clint (no surprises there).

Bucky screamed and screamed and screamed all the way to the bottom of the chute!

Then the ride ended with an abrupt --thunk-- and Bucky had to shake himself a little because the sudden stop at the end of the slide sure rang his bell. Wow. Lucky for him, he realized when he looked around, that Jarvis deployed the helmet part of his HUD thingy on the way down and this big green bin here fulla soft stuff broke his fall. Bucky lay back for a minute to catch his breath, gazing up at the grey sky overhead.

Holy cow! The slide shot him all the way outta the house!

Then the soft stuff underneath of him groaned.

""Unca Cwint?"" Bucky sat up on his uncle. ""Whaddaya doin' here?""

""Oh, you know, just looking for one of thirty-six thousand roaming pets. In the bottom of a dumpster. As usual,"" Uncle Clint groaned, rubbing at his own belly under Bucky's butt. ""God, they feeding you bricks, or what?"" he grumbled.

""A dumpthter?"" Bucky sat up higher on Uncle Clint's chest, scrambling up to use his shoulder as a step stool and get a good look around. Yup, definitely outside and in a dumpster. ""Whatta we doin' in a dumpthter?""

""More importantly--what are  you  doin' in the dumpster?"" Uncle Clint groused like an old man, but he clutched at Bucky's leg to steady him anyhow.

Bucky climbed back down to sit on his uncle's middle and gave him a little shove, then crossed his arms and huffed when Uncle Clint didn't even budge a little. ""I athked you firtht.""

""Well, I asked you  last--no tagbacks,"" Uncle Clint added for good measure, poking Bucky in the shoulder with his big, bony finger.

""Jarbith thowed me the thlide in the thchoolroom. He thaid it wath waxthed and all, tho I figg'ered it wath okay ta uthe,"" Bucky said with a lazy shrug. Not that he really stuck around long enough to wait for Jarvis to tell him whether it was okay to slide, now he thought about it. Whoops. ""How come the thlide endth in a dumpthter? Wow. And I wath goin' weal fatht. I'dda cracked my head if you weren't hewe ta break my fall.""

Uncle Clint sighed like his ma asked him to help carry all the groceries up four flights of stairs.

""Because it's not a slide. It didn't occur to you that people don't just randomly install slides in their houses for fun before you dove into one head-first?"" Uncle Clint demanded, righting him and Bucky both and dusting them off. Uncle Clint levered himself real easily up over the side of the dumpster, then reached in for Bucky, mumbling all the while about how keeping himself alive was a full time job as it was, much less a six year old hellbent on having a helmet permanently stapled under his chin at the rate he was going.

""Normal people don't have houthe robotth or vacuum tube elevatorth to thuck you from one floor to another, either,"" Bucky pointed out in his defense.

""Yeah, okay, I'll give you that,"" Uncle Clint nodded with a smile and a ruffle of Bucky's hair. ""It's an old garbage chute, I think. Either they left it in after construction or it was just part of the way they handled waste management in the Lodge before the elevators were installed to make trash removal invisible,"" his uncle explained. ""I accidentally stumbled across one while I was looking for--something else,"" he finished, eyeing Bucky like he almost said something he shouldn't have.

""I can help you look,"" Bucky offered. ""Whaddaya lookin' for ethactly?""

Clint sighed again, real exasperated-like. He gave Bucky a real hard eyeball all over and put his hands on his hips, like he was deciding something. ""A missing ... pet. She's a kind of ... reptile. Her name is Birdie. Lucky was supposed to be keeping an eye on her for a few minutes, but I guess he got distracted by the puppies.""

""There are a lot of puppieth,"" Bucky pointed out helpfully. It wasn't Lucky's fault he was the only growedup dog around. He was like a new dad and it was a lot of puppies to keep out of the fire until Mr. Tom put the big gate up to keep the poor, dumb puppies from walking right in to sniff around and burn their noses. Puppies are a lot like kids, Bucky figured.

""Well, Birdie is more trouble than ten puppies all on her own. I shouldn't have left her with Lucky, but she was  sleeping  and it was only a few minutes..."" Uncle Clint said almost to himself.

""Nat thayth I can find trouble in an empty room in my thleep,"" Bucky stated proudly. He loved pullin' Nat's pigtails by disappearing before breakfast to play hide and go seek without telling her it was hide and go seek. She always found him, though. Always. She was the best at hide and go seek.

""Okay, so Birdie is like  one  of you."" Uncle Clint tweaked Bucky's nose, but he was smiling, so Bucky figured he'd be okay and stop worrying so much.

""Where hab you thecked tho far?"" Bucky asked, clomping up the back steps to the Lodge beside his uncle.

Uncle Clint looked up at the Lodge with another real hard sigh. ""Only the top four floors so far, but with the garbage chutes and passages, she could really get anywhere she wanted in the house pretty quickly from my room."" He paused, his eyes tracking along the windows on the first floor for a few moments, then the light in them changed and his smile got real sly. ""I have an idea.""

""A twap?"" Bucky asked, nodding, because he really hoped that's what Uncle Clint was thinking, but also because it would be a lot of fun to build one--and probably take so long, he'd miss his bath before dinner. And if there was anything Bucky was eager to miss, it was a second bath in the same day when he could be catching loose reptiles in the house with a carrot and a stick. Or a box! Yeah, a stick and a box, just like in the cartoon shorts they showed between the Saturday afternoon pictures back home in Brooklyn.

""Hmm..."" Uncle Clint thought real hard, opening the door for Bucky. He led Bucky down the main hall and off to the side, down one of the long, echoing stone corridors of the wings full of fancy rooms for company. They passed a couple sitting rooms and a smoking room with a billiard table, a couple of rooms of glass cases full of sparkly crystal Bucky wasn't allowed in, and three more filled with good china Bucky also wasn't allowed in, all the way to the one sparkling with silver (nobody had told Bucky he couldn't go in there yet, but it was still early): dishes and utensils and big fancy pots, all in silver, sat all over the room on open shelves and behind glass and on little pedestals. There was more silver than there was spaces for it in the whole room.

""I have an idea,"" Uncle Clint whispered, pulling Bucky across the hall to the library, ""but first, we need to find some marshmallows.""

Bucky grinned with lots of teeth. ""Darthy hath marthmallowth--lotth of them.""

So ... where exactly *is* Birdie?

Okay, so I know this is short (and holy carp, it was hard to write!), but I think you'll understand why after you read it. ;-) Have fun! *waves*

Btw, this chapter officially marks the Two Front Teef verse's 100,000-word milestone. There are just over 100K words in this series now! Thank you so much to everyone who has read, left kudos, and commented on this series! All the excitement for new updates and encouragement along the way have kept me updating this story and series for the third December in a row. More to come soon!

Birdie is  not  lost.

It isn't Birdie's fault, though. She was supposed to stay with fuzzy Lucky at naptime, but the small Hawk with long, dark hair opened the door. Called fuzzy Lucky. Fuzzy Lucky's nails click-clacked, click-clacked all the way around the big Hawk's nest and disappeared. When Birdie climbed up the covers hanging on the side of big Hawk's nest, Birdie saw the door was open.

When the door is open, they go outside (outside is not inside). Usually, Birdie rides outside hidden under fuzzy Lucky's collar, but sometimes, big Hawk takes Birdie along in his front pouch.  Hoodie, Birdie remembers him telling her it is called.

""HOODIE,"" Birdie hooted, reminding herself and also scaring herself a little when the word bounced back at her from all sides. She tumbled out of big Hawk's nest on the far side, away from the big, soft nest she shared with fuzzy Lucky at naptime.

 Dog bed, big Hawk calls the big, soft nest covered in fuzzy Lucky's fur. But Birdie is not dog. (Dog is fuzzy, wears collar, barks, eats pizza, does not do tricks for treats, babysits Birdie.)

On the far side of big Hawk's nest, it was very easy to see outside the door. Birdie had not been out there alone before. The lodge is very big. Big Hawk showed Birdie what to do in an emergency, where to go, how to get there, but did not say what is  emergency.

Big Hawk and fuzzy Lucky are gone. Door is usually shut, but is open now. Birdie is awake, not napping with fuzzy Lucky at naptime.

Is this  emergency?

Birdie did not know.

What would big Hawk do?

 Better safe than sorry , he sometimes says to the human hatchlings when they did not know the answer to questions.

Is this  better safe than sorry ?

Birdie decided it might be. In  emergency, Birdie should leave room (scratch on door if closed) (door not closed, OPEN), turn left (left is quiver side, right is bow side), walk long hall to intersection (intersection  is where two [two  is more than  one, less than  three] hallways meet and make four hallways [four  is more than  three]), turn right (bow side), and continue walk to top of stairs. If no big Hawk is waiting there, Birdie is allowed downstairs. Can see front door from stairs. Go there. In  emergency, door should open soon. If door doesn't open (door is closed), Birdie is allowed to break window beside door to leave lodge. (Boots break window. Shoes do not. Birdie remembers.)

Before Birdie can throw boot at window, a tiny box rolled up and stopped in front of Birdie.

""Wat!"" Birdie asked.  

A voice. The one in the ceiling. (Ceiling  is top wall of room. Overhead. Inside only. Not  outside. Outside is sky, not  ceiling.) Ceiling voice said, ""Do not break the window. If you wish to open a door, scratch it, and I will open the door for you. My name is Jarvis and I am at your service, young Birdie.""

Birdie scared. Stepped back two times. Squinted at box. Ceiling voice has never spoken to Birdie before. How does it know Birdie?

""Wat!"" Birdie demanded.

""Do you need to go outside?"" ceiling voice asked.

""Uck!"" Birdie said clearly. (Clearly  is not   mumbled.  Mumbled  is hard to  lip-read. Lip-read happens when  shinies  are not in big Hawk's ears.  Shinies help big Hawk hear, but are also called  ears? Birdie decides to call them  shinies  so only one thing is called  ears.) (Also, Birdie cannot say  fuzzy Lucky  yet.  Soon, maybe, says big Hawk, then, patience, baby girl.)

""Do you wish to go where Lucky has gone?"" ceiling voice asked.

""Out!"" Birdie squawked.

""Lucky has not gone out,"" ceiling voice said from tiny box. ""Do you still wish to go out?""

Birdie sat back on her tail, rubbed her claws together. She is not sure.

""If you climb atop this robot, I can direct it anywhere you would like to go in the lodge. Is there a place or a person you would like to see?"" ceiling voice asked.

A place.

Or a person.

Birdie remembers seeing Darcy in the middle of sleeps last night. Birdie has missed Darcy. Birdie will go to Darcy.

It took her a few tries and some help from another rolling box with claws like Birdie's, but Birdie climbed up on the first talking, rolling box and laid flat, stretching her legs out to all the sides, wings spread. She tucked her tail in safely so no smoosh or ouch. (Smoosh  is when big Hawk accidentally steps on tail, says ""Fuck, fuckerdoodle, fuck! Sorry, baby girl! Are you okay? I didn't mean to smoosh your tail! I'm so sorry. Do you want a kiss to make it better?""  Kisses  make  smoosh  and  ouch  better.  Ouch  is when tails feels spicy.  Spicy  is  tacos,  hot sauce,  chili,  lady on calendar,  bad words like fuckerdoodle.  Spicy  is a lot of things. Birdie should not try to say  fuckerdoodle, though. Too  spicy.  Ouch.)

""Dar!"" Birdie asked, and the talking, rolling box started to roll to a wall. Before they crashed, part of the wall slid away. (Away  is  not here.) They rolled in a long, dark tunnel. Birdie closed her eyes, scared, but this is the way to Darcy. Ceiling voice talked and other rolling box moved into wall first, turned around, beeped. Two (more than  one, less than  three) lights shined on the floor ahead. Two more lights shined against the walls, making it less dark and scary. Ceiling voice told Birdie the ride will be short. It will be with her the whole way. She is safe.

Birdie likes ceiling voice.

Ceiling voice reminded her its name is Jarvis.

""Jar!"" Birdie asked.

The ceiling voice made a sound like big Hawk's sigh (sigh  is  tired). ""Jar  will do for now.""

Birdie is not lost with Jarvis.

Birdie is safe.

Update, 3/30/2019: No, I haven't forgotten about this story! I was having some vision problems way back in December, beginning a few days before Christmas. Recently, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, which causes vision impairment! So now I know at least I'm not going blind! My vision is slowly returning to normal as I get my BP under control. Thank you so much to everyone who's asked after my health and well being! I am getting better!

I hope to return to this story soon with updates, but in the meantime, if you enjoy baby animals as much as I do, you should check out this post on my tumblr to get a look at exactly what's keeping me so busy this spring. 

https://chrissihr.tumblr.com/post/183876920719/so-the-hubs-and-i-did-a-thing-today-shes-a

Darcy accidentally overhears a private conversation when she takes a shortcut to the library through the vents.

Hi. So. Remember how I wanted to post a bunch of updates this winter and that didn't happen?

ICYMI, I started having vision problems the week before Christmas. My eye doctor couldn't figure me out. In February, I was still losing my vision and having a bunch of other health problems that seemed unrelated, including a rapid heart beat. Turns out, vision problems are an early sign of high blood pressure. And mine was dangerously high--strokes-imminent high. Got a 'script for BP meds and the doc upped my anxiety med dosage, told me to learn how to meditate, maybe try yoga or get a dog. 

I'm managing my health. I'm sorry my stories had to take a back seat for a while, but I figure you'd all understand why. I'm working on it. And I did get the dog. You can see pics of her on my tumblr or IG, @chrissihr. Her name is Ruth Biter Ginsbark. She's currently an 11-week-old, Old English Bulldog, and she's a *bucket* of work. I love her to pieces. She's very good for my heart.

I'm sorry for the delay, but I'm working on it. My plan is to work on the Two Front Teef 'verse and my Darcy/Clint/Bucky fic, Endless Summer, the next few months. If you're still here for soft, stay at home dad!Tony and tiny Darcy and Bucky, let me know in the comments. I could use the encouragement to get back on track like you don't even know. Thanks for sticking with me.

Darcy wanted to help plan the wedding.

She really did.

But adults wanted to have boring grown up parties for weddings with tocktails and bored'ourves and fancy, floofy dresses instead of fun stuff like bounce houses and T-shirt cannons and cornfetti and plain old jeans.

If Darcy planned this wedding, it sure wouldn't be boring.

And there wouldn't be any floofy dresses at all ever.

So first chance she got, while her Daddy and Mommy Pepper were busy looking at Mommy Pepper's tablet, Darcy slipped off the end of the sofa in their big bedroom suite where she'd been napping with her daddy and excused herself to the bathroom.

The one in the hall for guests.

The one with the towel rack like a tall ladder right up to the big vent in the ceiling.

She knew she had at least a ten minute head start because Jarvis didn't monitor inside the bathrooms except in 'mergencies.

And the vent over this bathroom led to a secret tunnel.

Which Darcy only found out because sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night to Bucky hissing at her to see if she's awake when he's had one of the real bad, cold dreams and he crawls through the vent and shows up in her room when she's not in the big bed with Daddy and Mommy Pepper. Bucky's hands and feets are always real cold after one of those real bad dreams and he likes to climb under the covers with her and warm up and not be sad and alone anymore.

Sometimes, he cries.

But he asked Darcy not to tell because it would make Captain Steve sad. So Darcy keeps extra socks under her mattress for him and she hugs Bucky extra tight when he's sad and cold and feeling lonely after his bad dreams.

And because he's her very best friend, he showed her the trick with the vents that he learned in the tower.

But Darcy found the super secret passage to the first floor libary on her own.

She was at the bottom of the long, spiral stairway inside the wall, about to push the bar that swings the door open to the libary, when she heard hushed voices clear as day through the back side of the bookshelves hiding the secret door.

""Hey, Unca Cwint, how come you don't got a wady fwiend wike Thteebie and Darthy'th pop got?"" Bucky whispered. ""Whatcha don't wanna get mawwied o'thomethin'?""

""Nosy,"" Agent Clint whispered back.

""No, no--I'm theriouth,"" Bucky swore. ""How'th come?""

Agent Clint sighed. ""I had a ... a lady friend a while back, but it was complicated and didn't work out, so we broke up and decided to be friends.""

""How come you didn't twy ta meet anover wady fwiend?"" Bucky asked. ""Ya an Avenger and ya got a gweat dog and all thothe thwell piztha t-thirtth, and ya know how ta juggle, too! Ya pwolly got wadieth who wike Avengerth fawwin' all over ya ever' time ya thtep out.""

""Yeah, well, the cape chasers aren't interested in me, pal."" Agent Clint sounded real tired. ""They all want the money, brains, or muscles of this outfit.""

""You got motht a thothe!"" Bucky hissed.

To Darcy, it sounded like Agent Clint was smiling when he said, ""Sh! I do my best not to let people know I'm smarter than they think."" He stopped and then said, ""And anybody'd have muscles with a two-hundred pound draw on their bow. That's just practice and routine.""

""Tho ya bwoke up wif ya wady fwiend and jutht dethided it wath gonna be you and Piztha Dog awone fowevah?"" Bucky sounded real sad and Darcy wanted to hug him. She hated when he sounded sad.

""No,"" Agent Clint snorted. ""God, Buck. I date. Sometimes. I ... I don't always date ladies, though.""

There was a long minute when nobody said anything.

""Who do ya date if it'th not wadieth?"" Bucky asked and his voice was much louder this time.

Agent Clint shushed him in a hurry. ""I had a ... a guy friend for a while, but he... It didn't work out, either. Which is why I don't usually talk about it or date, okay, nosy?"" Agent Clint grumped at Bucky.

""You..."" Bucky didn't seem to know what to say for a long minute. ""You dated a fewwa? Ith that even awwowed?"" he whispered.

""It is now. People aren't always nice about it, but nobody goes to jail for it anymore,"" Agent Clint explained. ""And I liked him a lot. I'dda gone to jail for 'im.""

""What'th hith name?""

""Doesn't matter, kiddo. He's gone now."" Agent Clint cleared his throat. ""I introduced him to my lady friend. They're a better match, good for each other."" He sounded real tired again. ""They're both better off now.""

""I'm thorry,"" Bucky whispered.

Darcy snuck out of the hidden door and crawled under the table beside Agent Clint. ""I'm sorry, too,"" she whispered.

Agent Clint's arms flailed and he hit his head under the table and said a bunch of bad words, so Darcy only got a quick look across the hall at the pile of silver dishes and mini marshmallows all stacked up under a box held up by a stick before the sounds of screaming echoing from upstairs reached the libary.

""Shit, shit!"" Agent Clint hissed as someone who sounded like Darcy's mommy started shouting a lot more bad words about a rat that got in the house and came right into her room and all. ""I know this looks bad, but it's not a rat! Don't kill it!"" Agent Clint shouted as he ran down the hallway.

Darcy and Bucky scrambled up after him to follow, but Darcy caught her breath with worry when Agent Clint shouted next, ""Her name is Birdie! She's not a rat!""

  .,, . *""*. , .  *""*.,,.*""* 

Agent Clint has thome thplainin' to do.

Hey, guys! Welcome back! I was so worried I wouldn't have time to update this story this December, but here we are!!! 

I've got a definite Big Moment point I'd like to write to for this winter, so don't be surprised if updates continue for a bit after Christmas. We'll see how many chapters I can squeeze in between here and the big tent pole moment I've got in the works. *waggles eyebrows*

As I should say every December and in case I've forgotten in the past: thank you all so much for your patience with me in letting me come back to dabble in this world and play with these fun characters every winter for the past five years, and for your ongoing encouragement in kudos and comments and DMs on tumblr, even when I've not been well enough to update at all, like December of 2019. My vision is still not much improved and 2020 circumstances being what they are, I don't have a ton of quiet time to write with everyone at home on lockdown here in eastern PA, but I'll do my best to give you something fun to look forward to reading the next little while. And I hope you'll return the favor by visiting with me in the comments a while this holiday season to share in that fun with me and the others who enjoy revisiting this story. 

Happy holidays, my Darcyland friends. I hope it's a good one. 

--Chrissi

The little dragon took a shine to Pepper.

That's what got her caught in the first place. Pepper runs hot from Extremis and baby dragons are apparently attracted to heat sources, or so said Clint when Tony finally got everyone calmed down and the rat-- dragon  perched safely on his own shoulder where it explored his goatee thoroughly before climbing down the front of his shirt to tap, claw, and click at the arc reactor glowing under soft, black cotton.

""She likes you, Daddy,"" Darcy giggled as the arc reactor backlit the teeny dragon's tissue paper-thin wings. Little claws scrabbled at his scar tissue, trying to find a handhold until they caught on the edges of the reactor's rim. She peeped softly and Darcy stroked the dragon's tiny dorsal ridges through his band T-shirt.

""Darcy, you knew about this?"" Pepper asked with a sigh.

Tony was hard pressed not to intervene when Darcy's cheeks pinkened at being caught with a secret, but he had to give Pepper the same room to parent their little Stark that she gave him without stepping in to fix things all the time.

""I think I knowed her when I was big,"" Darcy said softly, confusion pinching her brow.

""You did,"" Barton confessed. ""We both did. We found her together late one night on Asgard, when you went ... away--to study there and I came to ... visit and see a healer friend of yours."" (Tony appreciated the way Clint self-edited for little ears as he explained.) ""I think it has something to do with your-- I'm sorry."" Clint cut himself off and turned his attention from something deeply pained and full of regret that Darcy brought out in him to face her parents. ""And I'm sorry I can't tell you both more right now, but I need to talk privately with Darcy before I tell you anything else I know about Birdie or Darcy. Not all of the secrets I keep are mine to share.""

Darcy snuggled deeper into Tony's arms, but she nodded in understanding. ""When I was big, Agent Clint kept secrets for me. Right, Jarvis?"" she asked the A.I.

""Indeed, Darcy,"" Jarvis confirmed. ""Privacy protocols enacted by your grown self, as well as Sergeant-Major Barnes and Agent Barton prevent me from expounding on the nature of those secrets at the present time.""

Tony, despite the reputation that preceded him, didn't actually want to violate his daughter's privacy. He leveled his most patient dad stare on Barton, instead. ""If her secrets endangered her, you'd tell us, right?""

Barton's jaw clenched and he rolled his lips slowly through his teeth. ""I'd find a way without breaking any confidences. Darcy's safety is actually more important to me than you realize.""

""I'm getting that."" And Tony  was  starting to see the edges of that picture--a love triangle-shaped picture, he quietly amended, remembering the Darcy parts of the slideshow from the previous night with renewed understanding when pieced together with this new information about Barton and Darcy finding a baby dragon together during a midnight stroll on Asgard. 

""Is Darcy in any kind of danger from proximity to Birdie?"" Pepper finally interceded in Tony's stare down with his formerly grown daughter's apparent sleepover buddy. 

Clint ran a hand through his hair and exhaled in relief. ""No, nothing like that. Baby dragons just get into, uh, mischief easily because they're so small and curious. Like a really tiny Bucky. She needs twenty-four-seven supervision, but she hasn't sparked her torch gland yet, so I thought I could step out for a few minutes while she was napping with Lucky."" He chuckled. ""I was clearly mistaken.""

""You'll keep Birdie with you from now on or deputize an adult human to watch her when you need to go out?"" Pepper checked. 

""Yes, ma'am."" 

Tony almost laughed out loud at the contrition on Barton's face. 

""And it sounds like we'll need to do some fireproofing and buy more fire extinguishers for whenever she does spark her torch gland?"" Pepper concluded, staring Barton down with her new Mom Look.

""Uh."" Barton rubbed the back of his neck. ""That's actually a great idea,"" he admitted.  

""Jarvis, can you take care of that and ... hmm... assign a subroutine to track Birdie in the house and on the grounds at all times without her wearing a tracker?"" Tony wondered aloud. The old lodge was a bit of a rambling rabbit warren in some places. He'd need to install a better Jarvis-capable network if they stayed another week or so. 

""The fireproofing and extinguishers are no problem, of course, Sir, but at present, continuous observation and supervision is possible only through the network of available cleaning drones if the creature cooperates,"" Jarvis was forced to admit. ""If she wore a tracker, it  would  be easier, Sir.""

""Hmm. Think she'd let me take her measurements and fit her for a custom pet collar?"" Tony wondered. 

""If it's sparkly or shiny, she'll let you, but there's no guarantee she won't find a way to claw it off and add it to her hoard somehow."" Clint sighed like someone who'd gotten a new puppy and had no idea what he'd been getting himself into. 

And he'd be right.

If you love soft, domestic Avengers, you might enjoy the other story I posted this week for the WinterHawk Wonderland gift exchange, Guardian Angel, featuring soft Avenger Dads Clint and Bucky + puppies and babies + Team as Family. 

Before that, I added a few fun Halloween one-shots here on the Archive: Tick Check (a cracky sex pollen/werewolf one-shot); A Story Told in Flesh (a lengthy WinterShock autumn smut fest); and Goodbye, Rumlow...

Again. 

Except tonight, it's not the usual plague of nightmares keeping him awake, but something Dr. Raynor said. 

 You've been ignoring Sam Wilson again. You need to trust people, James. You need to cultivate friendships.  

And it's a nice idea, in theory. Only problem is, Bucky hasn't had a friend --Yori and Shuri aside--since Steve, and he isn't sure he even knows how to make a friend anymore, let alone  be  one. 

That's what's really holding him back, most times. He's a killer. An assassin.  The Winter Soldier . That all of these things are in the past, that he's making amends, doing his best to move forward, doesn't hold as much weight as the rest of it. How could he be much of a friend to anyone when most of the time, he can't even make sense of himself? Friendship takes work, and Bucky just wants to be sure he can give and take in equal measure. 

So he keeps himself at a distance, for the most part, even when he knows, deep down, that he shouldn't. That he's doing himself, and people like Sam, a disservice by holding back, ignoring texts, not making any effort to reach back out. 

Sighing, Bucky rolls over, picking up his phone and scrolling through the last few weeks of texts from Sam, all of them unanswered. 


 I'll be in Louisiana for the next few weeks, but you have my number. Check in every once and a while, lmk you're alive.  



 Lmk = let me know. I know you're an old man who might not know these things ;) 



 I'm in D.C this weekend if you wanna head down here, only a train ride away.  



 What do you do when you're not in your court-ordered therapy sessions, anyway? I'm imagining you talking to a plant.  



 ...Please tell me you don't actually talk to your plants. 



 [IMG.765] 



 You should get this for the arm. Get it? It's a panther.  


Reading through the messages, all these attempts at reaching out, Bucky feels like an asshole. How hard is it to pick up his phone and reply? Tell Sam they could meet up in D.C., even if it's just to take a walk in silence or something? It'd probably be a hell of a lot better than wandering around New York alone. 

It's three in the morning, but Bucky types out a message, stopping and starting over a good few times before he settles on something he feels okay enough to send. 


 Hi, Sam, how are you? Sorry I've been mostly MIA. How are things? I was thinking we could do something one day soon. Lmk. -- Bucky  


When he wakes up in the morning, the sun blinding through his curtainless windows, Bucky's pleasantly surprised to see a text from Sam come in as he sips his coffee.


 He's alive! Good to hear from you, Buck. You feel like coming down to D.C? I have the weekend free and company would be nice, it's been a while.  



 Wait a minute, 3AM? Man don't you sleep? Also, you know you don't have to sign your texts, right? You sound like a grandpa.  


Bucky stretches, yawns, thinks about getting up for a second cup of coffee before spending another endless day with his thoughts, and replies before he can think any better of it. 


 Company sounds good.  


*

Sam meets Bucky at the train station, and it's only a matter of minutes before Bucky wonders if he's made a mistake. Sam looks happy enough, casual in his green bomber jacket and jeans, a black t-shirt beneath the jacket. He looks Bucky up and down and asks, not unkindly, if he's going for the  undercover look.  

Bucky stares down at his own clothes: faded black jeans, black leather jacket over a black t-shirt, black sneakers. A hat that is technically charcoal gray but could easily pass for more black. 

""It's... a lot of black,"" Bucky acknowledges. 

""Nah, it suits you in a way,"" Sam says, apparently aware of Bucky's near immediate discomfort. ""Like a rugged James Bond. So,"" he says, changing the subject and leading them out of the train concourse and into the bright sunlight of the early spring day. ""What brings you here, Buck? You finally ready to admit you missed me?""

Bucky frowns. This doesn't have to be a big deal, but Sam is certainly making it into one.  

""I don't know,"" Bucky says, blowing out a breath. He looks around him. D.C. in the spring is nice, he realizes. The trees are in full bloom, there are people milling around everywhere, posing for pictures and talking and taking in the scenery, not to mention that the sun makes everything look... bright.  Hopeful , even. It's refreshing, being somewhere new.

""I'll take that silence as a 'Sam I missed you so much I simply had to come down and see you for myself, and by the way, you're the best, strongest Avenger out there.' And that's flattering, Buck, but--""

Bucky cuts him off. ""My therapist thinks I need to  cultivate friendships ,"" he explains. Sam's smile is so smug it's making him feel a little crazy. 

""Aw, the bionic staring machine has  finally  come around to the idea being friends,"" Sam gloats.

""No I haven't, it's basically court-ordered friendship--""

""He wants to eat ice cream cones and take me fishing,"" Sam continues.

""Forget it,"" Bucky grits out. ""Forget I said anything. Enjoy the rest of your weekend,  Samuel , I'm sure I can get another train.""

""Oh no, don't you  Samuel  me. Come on, be my friend, Buck, I dare you. I  double  dare you,"" Sam grins. 

Bucky rolls his eyes. ""You  dare  me? What are you, Steve Rogers in kindergarten?"" 

""Hardly,"" Sam retorts. ""Kid was asthmatic and sick more than he wasn't. C'mon,"" Sam continues. ""Do it. You can't turn down a dare.""

""I'm a hundred and six years-old, dares aren't really enticing to me these days."" Bucky's silent for a minute, taking in Sam's bright, laughing face and easy smile. He could be friends with Sam. He's a pain in the ass, like, a major pain in his ass. But he's a good guy, too. 

Not that he'd ever tell him that. Certainly not now, as Sam continues to smirk at him, arms folded over his chest like he's just waiting for Bucky to come around. 

""Fine,"" Bucky says. ""We're friends.""

""Oh no,"" Sam shakes his head, looking far too pleased with himself now. ""You're gonna have to earn my friendship, James Bucky Barnes.""

Of course he was. 

*

They spend the first part of their Saturday walking through the city, sightseeing and catching up. Sam has a small apartment downtown, and he points out little details as they pass them. 

The park where he runs -- where he used to run with Steve, Bucky knows, but neither of them say as much. He does wonder though, how Sam handles it, missing Steve so much sometimes it feels like a physical ache in his chest. 

Sam takes him to the place he likes to get his coffee, because, as Sam tells it,  Starbucks is too bougie. 

He tells Bucky about what he's been up to with the Air Force, the missions he takes and loves, the ones he takes and immediately regrets, and the people he's met along the way. Bucky can tell immediately that Sam has a particular affinity for this guy Joaquin Torres, who he teams up with more often than not. 

""He'll talk you ear off, fire off more questions about Tony Stark and Steve Rogers than any journalist I've ever met, but he's a great dude,"" Sam says, smiling. ""He'll do anything for you once you get to know him. He's just one of those guys, you know?"" 

Bucky  does  know, and thinks momentarily of Steve, again, his eternal quest to do the right thing -- the best thing -- every time, and wonders if he'll ever know someone like that again in his too-long life. 

""He sounds great,"" Bucky says as they walk. 

Sam drags him into Georgetown Cupcake, insisting that the line is worth it, even as Bucky grumbles that he doesn't need  anything  that bad, and continues to keep the conversation flowing pleasantly, steering them into an easy cadence. 

That's the thing about Sam, Bucky was starting to realize. As much as he enjoys giving Bucky a hard time about this friendship thing, he's clearly genuinely glad to see him, and he's making an effort to put him at ease, even if that meant carrying the conversation for them when Bucky can't find the right thing to say. 

It's nice, especially considering Bucky's long stretches of silence over the last few months. Bucky thinks of Sam's message last night. 

 Company would be nice, it's been a while .

He wonders if, despite the missions, the routines, his friendship with people like Torres, Sam is just a little bit lonely, too.

*

Sam's apartment isn't nearly as small as he made it seem. 

""This is really nice,"" Bucky tells him as Sam shows him around, pointing out the bathroom and the couch where Bucky would be sleeping for the weekend. 

And it  is  nice. Sam had clearly put a lot of time into decorating the place, making it a home. The couch looks lived-in but nice, a soft, deep brown leather that Bucky imagines must feel amazing to sink into. There are art prints on the walls, more than a few stacks of books around the living room that Bucky itches to peek into, and--

""You have a fish?"" Bucky asks, surprised. He walks over to the little tank and looks in at what he sees now are two fish, swimming in circles. 

""Two of them,"" Sam nods. ""That's Dave, and that over there's Squirtle.""

Bucky stares. "" Dave  and  Squirtle? What kind of names are those for fish?"" He asks. 

""You come into my house and mock my fish?"" 

""Not the fish, just their names,"" Bucky corrects. 

Sam laughs. ""I let my nephews name them,"" he explains. ""They're ten so...""

""Dave and Squirtle,"" Bucky nods. 

""Exactly.""

They decide to order pizza for dinner, and Sam introduces Bucky to Among Us while they wait. Bucky's mostly confused, but it's fun, and Sam gets into it, determined to pull one over on the people they're playing with. 

When Bucky's blob gets killed for the third time in a row, Sam laughs, lifting the last of his beer to his lips and shaking his head. ""Man, for a former assassin, you're  terrible  at being sneaky,"" Sam tells him, voice teasing.

Bucky laughs a little, then shakes his head. ""Hey, I gave all that up. It's why I'm here, befriending you, remember?""

""How could I forget? Bucky Barnes himself, here to sleep on my couch,"" Sam says. He's quiet for a minute, then: ""How's all that going, really?"" 

 Really?  Bucky thinks of the near constant nightmares, and Yori, and his failed date with Leah. The fact that he only has three contacts in his phone and one of them is here in this room and genuinely wants to know how he's doing and for once, Bucky's honest.

""It's okay,"" he says with a nod. ""Most of the time. It's slow going, but it's going."" It's not much, in the scheme of things, but it's a hell of a lot more than he's said to most people, even Dr. Raynor, most days, and he feels proud to have done it, this small breakthrough. 

""I have dreams sometimes that I'm... still... You know.""

Sam nods and doesn't press for more, and Bucky doesn't say anything else.

They're happy to spend the rest of the night flipping through channels, bickering about what to watch as Sam fills Bucky in on the plots of countless shows and movies he's missed over the years, before they settle on something Bucky actually  has  seen. 

""No way,"" Sam says, throwing his head back and laughing. ""Of all things, you've seen  Pretty Woman? ""

Bucky shrugs. ""It was on, I was up.""

""Good enough for me,"" Sam says, and sets the remote down. They settle in on his ridiculously plush couch and watch Julia Roberts get her hand snapped in a jewelry box. 

*

When Bucky gets back to New York on Sunday afternoon, his apartment feels especially silent. He pulls out his phone.


 So, does this mean we're friends? 



 Oh no, it's not that easy, Bucko 


Bucky groans, but he's smiling as he does it. 

*

A month later, Bucky gets a message from Sam, asking if he feels like meeting up. They've texted here and there since Bucky's trip to D.C. He's still kind of terrible about answering every single time, but he has reached out first a few times, and he thinks that counts for something. 


 I'm in your neck of the woods, you have time for a bite? 



 A bite? Who are you and what have you done with Sam? 



 Food, Buck, you wanna eat? I'm only in town today.  



 Where are you?  


Sam sends his location and Bucky is surprised by how happy he is to know that Sam's here, close by, and wants to see him.  Friends . 


 I know a place. 


Bucky grabs a jacket and sets off to meet Sam, debating between the sushi place and a taco place Sam might like, and he all but runs into him when he gets to the park Sam said he'd be. 

""Head in the clouds, Barnes?"" Sam says by way of greeting. He gives Bucky a quick half-hug, pulling back quickly as if realizing such a thing might not be welcome, and Bucky instantly misses the easy, familiar contact. Hugging isn't something he does -- well, ever, really -- and it'd been nice, however brief. 

""Hi, Sam,"" Bucky says. ""I didn't know you were in town.""

""I didn't know I was coming,"" Sam explains. ""I had a last minute work thing and I figured what better time to check in on Mr. Snow Miser?""

""Snow Miser?""

Sam laughs, thumbs over his phone for a second before turning it for Bucky to see and explaining that he's from some old Christmas movie for kids. 

""For kids?"" Buck asks, horrified. ""He's terrifying.""

""Yeah, and so are you, most of the time,"" Sam teases.

Bucky scoffs. ""You came all this way to call me names?"" 

""I came all this way for work,"" Sam corrects. ""The rest is just a bonus.""

""And here I thought you just wanted to see your friend.""

Sam laughs. ""Not so fast, you're not at friend level just yet.""

They walk through the park together, keeping pace easily as they dodge parents with strollers and dogs on leashes as they catch up. Bucky feels a little looser, this time, in his own city, walking with Sam. Maybe because they really are developing a rapport, or maybe just because that's how Sam is -- easy to be around. 

When they pass a gaggle of kids and parents by an ice cream truck, Sam stops in his tracks. ""I haven't stopped for the ice cream man in way too long,"" he says. 

So they stop for the ice cream man, if only because Sam looks about as excited as one of the kids in line, and what kind of monster would Bucky be to disagree? He gets a vanilla cone with chocolate sprinkles for himself, and a twist with chocolate sprinkles for Sam, and they find a bench to sit on. 

""Thanks,"" Sam says, diving into his cone. ""But you can't buy friendship either, you know,"" he adds with a smirk. 

Bucky sighs, and starts in on his own ice cream. He feels about ten years old, eating ice cream in the middle of the day in a park, and it's... nice, actually. 

""So,"" Bucky says, determined to get better at this. ""Work stuff all good?""

Sam looks at him, seems to weigh something in his head before responding. ""Yeah, work's all good. Except... I wasn't technically here for that kind of work. I know a guy at a bank up here and..."" He heaves a world-weary sigh, and Bucky's stomach tightens, positive bad news is about to follow. Sam's face -- in his limited experience with Sam's face, anyway -- never looks so pinched, and Bucky knows this can't be good. 

He waits, quiet while Sam organizes his thoughts and explains. 

""My family had this boat, growing up. A shrimping boat.""

""A shrimping boat?"" Bucky repeats, eyebrows furrowing. He's never heard of such a thing. 

Sam just nods. ""We have a seafood business,"" he continues. ""Hence the boat. Anyway, when I joined the Air Force, my sister, Sarah, stayed in Louisiana and took all that on -- caring for our parents, the boat, the store.""

""Sounds like a lot,"" Bucky says, imagining it. And since Sam mentioned nephews, he imagines Sarah was doing all this while taking care of kids. 

""It is,"" Sam sighs. ""Anyway, the boat's on its last legs, almost entirely busted, and we need a loan to keep everything afloat--no pun intended. I thought my contact here might be able to help me, but apparently not,"" Sam sighs again. 

""I'm sorry,"" Bucky offers, feeling helpless. He wants there to be something he can do, to offer Sam, but he hardly has boat money himself, and he knows next to nothing about boats, shrimping or otherwise. 

""Yeah,"" Sam nods. ""Thanks. We'll figure something out, the Wilsons always do. I have a few more contacts I'm hoping can help me,"" he says, obviously trying to lighten the mood. ""But until then,"" he says. ""What do you do for fun, Barnes?""

""Fun?"" Bucky repeats, the word like a foreign concept on his tongue. 

""You know, that thing people do in their free time? Something that makes them happy. Buck, I know you're not asking me to define  fun  for you, because that's just too sad, even for you, man.""

""I know what  fun  means,"" Bucky huffs. ""I'm not actually a... what was it again? Cold Miser? I do enjoy things.""

""Snow, Miser, but you're getting there,"" Sam tells him. ""Now, come on, give me the tour, I only have a few hours before I have to be back in D.C., and I want to see all the spots."" 

*

By the time Bucky gets back home, he's pleasantly exhausted after walking the length of the city with Sam for the better part of the day. He doesn't have  spots  , exactly, and he'd been a little hesitant, but Sam seemed to enjoy their long walks, even if they had limited destinations along the way. He kicks off his shoes and grabs a water from the fridge and stretches himself out on his bed. He might not sleep there most nights, but it  is  nice to lay on and unwind. 

He thinks of how easy it was, being with Sam, and as much as he hates to admit it, thinks again that maybe Raynor was right after all, and maybe he could have friends, someday. They were off to a good start, no matter what Sam said. They'd eaten their ice cream and made their way to Central Park, where Sam had helped some kid get his kite out of a tree, handing it back to him with a wink and a smile that was contagious. The kid's mom had looked ready to hug him. 

Now, Bucky lays there, sipping his water and scrolling idly through his phone, googling shrimping boats, just to see what's out there. He finds  a lot  of know it alls on Reddit, which makes him wary of anything they have to offer; some helpful YouTube videos of dads explaining exactly what to do and how; and helpful but vague WikiHow articles. 

It's definitely a start.

He lets himself think of how helpful something like this would have been all those winters ago, when the stove was on the fritz and Steve was down with pneumonia for the second time that season, and Bucky had spent  days  in a panic, trying to fix the thing without making anything worse. 

But at least he has it now, and he might be able to be of some use to Sam and his sister. He copies a few of the links into a text to Sam and sends them along, three in a row, with a note.


 This might not be too hard, between the two of us.  


Sam's reply is quick, and Bucky can almost see the surprise on his face. 


 Really?? 



 Yeah, I mean, I'm no Stark, but I think we could figure it out, if you wanted to try. 



 You might be earning that friendship card after all, Barnes. 


*

Things get a little hectic after Sam's trip to New York. He lets Bucky know he's headed to Sweden to track down a lead on some cult operation Torres has been watching from afar, and it's three weeks of radio silence after that. 

Bucky hates to admit it, but he'd kind of gotten used to regular texts from Sam, and his phone feels heavy and silent without them. 

After the first week, he'd texted Raynor, outlining his plight. 

 


 I haven't heard from Sam in a while. 



 Oh? I was under the impression you were still tacitly ignoring him.  



 Sometimes. We have an understanding now.  



 That sounds promising.  



 Maybe. Anyway, he's in Sweden now, so.  



 So you're texting me instead of him.  



 ...I guess I am.  



 You know, if you send them, he'll get the messages eventually, James. Not that I don't enjoy hearing from you.  



 Do you, though? 



 Text Sam.  


 


 * 



 Raynor says I should text you even if you don't have your personal phone. Feels kinda pointless, but here I am. Hope you and Torres are good.  



 I found a new article that might help with the boat.  



 Who is feeding Squirtle and Dave while you're away? 



 [IMG.341] 



 I found your ice cream man again today. Hope you're good.  



 I officially feel like an ass for ignoring you all that time. Lmk when you're back.  


 


 * 



 Did James Bucky Barnes MISS ME while I was gone? Lord, I must have missed hell freezing over.  



 I didn't say that. 



 It was implied in the five whole texts you sent me, Buck. That's the equivalent of a Dear John letter coming from you.  



 I take it all back.  



 You can't and you wouldn't anyway. My neighbor fed the fish while I was gone btw. It's nice you worried about us.  



 It was a question, not a worry.  



 It's okay to worry about your friends, you know. And I'm home, since you asked me to let you know.  



 So, this means we're friends? 



 Missed you too, Buck.   



 * 


It's early summer now, and Bucky's hot. He's hot and he's bored, and he isn't sure what to do with himself when he feels this kind of listlessness. He remembers when he and Steve would lay on the floor in weather like this, in boxers and little else, and take turns reading from one of their books to distract themselves. Bucky was rarely distracted even then, but still, it had been nice.
At least back then he hadn't been alone. Then again, at least now he has air conditioning. The problem is that his arm and his body feel like two different temperatures sometimes, like he's always a few degrees behind the cool metal of the arm, and sweating trying to regulate it. 

Thinking of Steve and trying to distract himself from the heat is how Bucky ends up in the used bookstore he passes sometimes. He's been in a few times, makes small talk with the guy behind the counter, and lets himself wander through the stacks of well-loved books, browsing. How many books had been published from the time he enlisted to now? He can't wrap his brain around that kind of number. 

Bucky picks up The Fellowship of the Ring, because he recognizes the author, and it's one of those things most people have read. Kings, rings, friendship... it sounds like his kind of book, anyway. He's making his way out of the store after a five minute conversation with the cashier about the series, promising he'd be back for the next two once he finishes, when his phone vibrates in his pocket. 


 Hey, Buck. You feel like letting me sleep on your couch? 



 Sure. When? 



 Tonight? 



 That's short notice, Samuel. Lucky for you I'm a good friend with no social life. You need the address? 



 I got it. 



 Do I want to ask how that is? 



 Probably not. See you in a few hours. 



 * 


""No way,"" Sam says, as soon as he sets foot in Bucky's apartment. His eyes skim from the hardwood of the floors to the small table by the wall, then land on Bucky. 

""What? You have a better option?"" Bucky asks, indignant.

""I asked to sleep on your couch,"" Sam says slowly. ""You didn't wanna mention you don't even own a couch?!""

Bucky exhales. ""Well, I sometimes sleep on the floor, I figured you could take the bed.""

""The floor? Every  night?  Listen, I know how hard it is to adjust, but man, you need some  furniture .""

""Well, I guess you can find a hotel if you want..."" Bucky says awkwardly. He honestly hadn't thought about it much more than offering Sam the bed, but then he thinks of Sam's apartment, all his little touches of home, carefully arranged and probably collected over time, and realizes that of course Sam would be stunned by his mostly empty apartment. Interior design is hardly his strong suit, though. 

""Pfft,"" Sam shakes his head. ""We're going to IKEA."" 

""No,"" Bucky says immediately. 

""Have you ever even been to IKEA before?"" Sam asks, raising an eyebrow. 

""No, but I know what it is,"" Bucky says. It's four o'clock; they should be thinking about dinner and what they were going to do tonight. Bucky would rather listen to Sam give him shit about his empty apartment than trail around IKEA trying to fill it. It feels too pathetic, somehow. 

""Come on, let's go. It'll be fun. You know, that word you learned recently,"" Sam smiles, and there's something in that smile that makes Bucky swallow any argument he might have had before it leaves his lips. 

""Fine,"" he sighs. 

An hour later, Bucky's following Sam through miniature apartments, all decorated like you could move right in if you wanted. It did make his apartment look pretty bleak in comparison, even he could admit that much. Sam, though, was filling an oversized shopping cart with things Bucky could not imagine any actual use for. 

""Is that a fake plant?"" He asks. 

""Yeah,"" Sam says, ""you're not ready for the real deal yet.""

""I don't need plants,"" Bucky argues.

""No one  needs  plants, Buck. They're nice. They brighten up a room. Let that smile of yours out to play more often and that might do it too,"" he teases. ""But in the meantime. Try it out. You don't only have to own things you  need . Some things are just nice.""


 Some things are just nice. 


Bucky can hardly argue with that kind of logic. He isn't used to having things just because. Growing up, everything belonged to his parents, and then once he was older, he and Steve were living together and trying to make ends meet. It was a nice life, but there wasn't a whole lot of room for extras. Then the war, then the Winter Soldier, then Wakanda, and now...

Now he's here with Sam, buying a plant because it's nice. 

By the time they leave, Bucky has not only the plant, but throw blankets, a couple of pillows, a couch, and a coffee table, both of which would need to be put together. 

""It's a good start,"" Sam says as they leave. 

And while it is a good start, what Bucky didn't consider is that Sam would suggest putting everything together as soon as they get back. 

""You don't have to build my furniture,"" Bucky argues. ""I promise I'll put it together, you can trust me,"" he adds.

Sam laughs, dropping onto the floor and pulling out a keychain pocket knife to start opening boxes. ""Trust  me , you're gonna want the help."" 

Bucky decides not to argue and slips down beside Sam on the floor, pulling the instructions in front of him, flipping them over from front to back. ""These are impossible to read,"" he says, horrified.

""Like I was saying,"" Sam smirks. ""You'll be glad I'm here."" 

Bucky nods again. He's already glad Sam's here, but he doesn't say so out loud, just follows Sam's lead and starts organizing pieces by size, and pulling out packet after packet of screws. 

They organize themselves quickly, getting into a rhythm. After a half an hour, they have a framework that Bucky can almost imagine turning into a couch if he squints really hard. 

""This reminds me..."" Sam says, trailing off with a small, almost bittersweet smile on his face. Bucky looks up from his screwdriver, meeting Sam's eyes until he continues. ""When our first tour ended, Riley got this rinky dink apartment, filled it with furniture mostly secondhand, but he bought this table that was new, sure it was gonna show up all assembled. I wanted to know why the hell he thought it would arrive  put together ."" Sam laughs, and the sound echoes right through Bucky, making him smile in return. 

""Anyway, we spent hours arguing over that table,"" Sam continues. ""Eventually it got put together, but not without a lot of fighting, and at least three beers each. And pizza,"" he says. 

""I can buy us pizza,"" Bucky says. ""If you promise you won't yell at me."" 

Sam snorts. ""No one can make that promise when they put together furniture.""

Bucky's quiet for a minute. ""You miss him,"" he says. It's not a question because it would be a stupid question. It's clear every time Sam talks about Riley just how much he misses him. It's clear in the way his face softens in a combination of fondness and grief that's almost palpable. 

""Yeah,"" Sam says. ""He was  that  friend. It was just easy, you know?  No bullshit, not ever. Just a good guy. Probably knew me better than I knew myself, which I loved and hated, depending on the day. I thought I was the same way with him. But the one time we were out of sync... "" Sam trails off again, remembering. 

Two things strike Bucky at once. First, he knows how this story ends, because it's how all of these kinds of stories end, and he wishes he could offer something of substance, but he can't. 

Second, and more startlingly, Bucky realizes that he knows  exactly  the kind of friend Sam means, because that's the way Bucky himself feels when they're together. He knows he'll never replace Riley, never even come close, but he still hopes he can be a kind of comfort to Sam, too.

Unsure what to say, he reaches over and lays a hand on Sam's shoulder. ""He sounds great,"" Bucky says honestly. 

""You would've liked him. He had the whole quiet, serious thing going on, too."" 

Bucky gives him a small smile then. ""I'm sure I would've,"" he says.

It's late by the time they have everything put together and cleaned up, and Bucky looks around the room, surprised by what a difference they'd made. There had been a  few  minor arguments as they worked, mostly stemming from Sam's belief that Bucky was hiding pieces to mess with him. (Which, he had, but only  once  . The other time Sam really had been sitting on a screw.) The couch and the table are put together, and the pillows Sam insisted on actually  do  bring it together nicely. The fake plant sits on the coffee table now, and while Bucky still thinks it's kind of pointless, he can admit it looks kind of nice. 

""See?"" Sam says, flopping himself down onto the couch with a contented sigh. ""Looks like someone actually lives here now.""

""It's not so bad,"" Bucky agrees. 

""You ended up with a perfectly adequate collection of furniture. You've officially got yourself a bachelor pad.""

"" Perfectly adequate?""  Bucky huffs 

Sam grins at the distress that must be clear on Bucky's face, and he claps him on the back. ""It's nice, Buck, I mean it. And hey, you won't be sleeping on the floor, for one thing, so your spine will be thanking me even if you don't.""

""Why wouldn't I--""

""Well, you can sleep on the couch when things get bad, see if that's any better than the floor. Happy medium between your marshmallow bed. Y'know, when I'm not here, that is,"" Sam clarifies.

Bucky considers this. Even if he doesn't sleep on the couch, it is nice to have this place feel a little more like  his. A little more like a home. ""Thank you."" he says, honestly. ""I... This isn't something I would've done on my own. You're a good friend, Sam.""

""Oh no, is this the moment I have to admit we're really friends?"" Sam teases, but he's smiling at Bucky fondly now, and Bucky can't look away. He isn't sure why, but he feels a little lightheaded, too. 

""We're friends,"" Bucky says firmly, ignoring the alarm bells ringing in his head, building into a cacophony of sound. Bucky would have to ask Dr. Raynor if all friendships in the twenty-first century were supposed to feel like this. 

*

Hardly any time passes at all until Bucky sees Sam next, and for that, he's thankful. He's not sure what to make of the confusing feelings he's starting to have about Sam, and decides that maybe seeing him again will bring him some clarity. 

Bucky's mulling over a text, something that sounds casual enough to send so soon, and then remembers that this  is  normal. Friends text each other all the time. Before he can though, his phone lights up in his hand, and Sam's name appears on his screen. 


 Can I take you up on that offer to fix the boat? 


The alarm bells in Bucky's head start to pick up tempo, but he doesn't hesitate before replying. 


 Just tell me when and where and I'll be there. 


Sam shares a location, and they discuss the details: flights, times, places to stay, and Bucky laughs when Sam warns him about his sister ( tough exterior, will do anything for anyone  ) and his nephews (  amazing, smart, too hyper for their own good ), and Bucky can't help but laugh thinking of Sam amid the pleasant chaos of family after chasing down bad guys and bank loans all this time. 

He doesn't add that he thinks Sarah sounds a lot like Sam, and that this particular batch of apples probably didn't fall far from the tree, but he doesn't go there. Instead, Bucky tells Sam to brush up on his reading, review all the how-tos Bucky's sent over the last few weeks, and tries not to think about the way his face flushes, warm and pink, when Sam replies that he'll figure it out, he's good with his hands. 

When Bucky gets to Sam's house a few days later, he finds the whole family outside, out on the dock, already crowding around the boat. There are two young boys running around playing catch, who he assumes are Sam's nephews, and he finds Sam frowning at a woman who looks to be at least a few years younger than Sam, but the resemblance is definitely there. Her smile is just as wide and welcoming as Sam's.

""You came!"" Sam says when he spots him, standing just a ways away from the family, unsure how to make his presence known just yet. Bucky's glad to be there, happy to be able to help Sam, but it's overwhelming, too. 

""Of course,"" Bucky says, frowning. ""You thought I wouldn't?"" 

""I don't know, man, you're..."" 

His frown deepens. ""What!"" Bucky demands, indignant now. Had he really proven so untrustworthy over these last few months?

""Flighty,"" Sam decides. He throws an arm around Bucky's shoulder, though, pulling him into a strong half-hug, and any argument fades from Bucky's lips. Sam's warm from the sun and his hold on him is strong enough to be grounding but not overwhelming, and Bucky's distracted for a minute, leaning into that warmth, and it takes him a minute to realize Sam is talking about him. 

""...The spaceman here is Bucky, a friend of mine,"" Sam's saying. ""He offered to help fix the boat and I took him up on it."" 

""Nice to meet you, Bucky,"" Sarah says, smiling and extending a hand. ""Sarah.""

""Likewise,"" Bucky says, flashing her a smile.

""And the two ragamuffins you see running around are AJ and Cass. They'll get tired eventually and come say hi,"" Sam explains. He's watching with such fondness in his eyes that Bucky has to look away, like he's seeing something he shouldn't. 

""Anyway,"" Sam says, turning back to Bucky, ""a lot of people helped us out with this, bringing over parts, and gas, and a lending hand. There's just a few things left,"" he gestures to the boat. 

""Sure, yeah,"" Bucky nods, following Sam onto the dock and hopping onto the boat with him. It's nice, if worn with time and sun and love, and definitely worth saving. He listens to Sam's instructions, following him around, lending a hand more often than not when something was screwed on too tightly, or too heavy for any normal person to be able to lift. 

He tries hard not to let his eyes keep flitting over to where Sam was working on the other side of the boat, and certainly not thinking about how good his arms looked, or the way the shorts he had on made his ass look--

""You gonna just stand there or you gonna actually help me?"" Sam calls, grinning at him like he could read every thought crashing through Bucky's mind, and he pulls himself together quickly. 

""I'm helping, I'm helping!"" Bucky yells back, but he can feel Sam's eyes on him from across the boat, just a little too long, and it's everything he can do not to turn back around and meet his gaze. 


 How had he ended up here? 


*

Dinner is a raucous affair. The kitchen is decently big, but with Sarah and Sam and the boys, plus Bucky, all moving in and out of it, carrying bowls and plates and a pitcher of iced tea to the table, it feels smaller than it is. More than once, Sam puts a hand on Bucky's hip, moving him out of the way, jostling him so he can get into a drawer or a cabinet, and every time, Bucky jumps like he's been scalded. 

""Relax, would you?"" Sam says, shooting him a confused look. ""It's just me!"" 

 It's just me.  Bucky rolls his eyes, because that's it, isn't it? Sam has never been  just  anything, not for a while now, and he can't  un-know  that fact. 

After the day out in the sun, a long, cool shower was everything Bucky had needed, and now, refreshed, warm, and surrounded by Sam's family, he feels more relaxed, more  himself  than he has in a long, long time. 

So, yeah, he's a little on edge at the idea of fitting in so well here, with Sam and the people he loves so much. Bucky hasn't had this kind of easy camaraderie in over seventy years, and it makes something in his chest feel like it's about to give way and snap. 

They take their places around the table while AJ and Cass talk excitedly about the progress on the boat, the possibility of taking it out fishing, and Sarah and Sam serve while Bucky pours everyone a glass of iced tea. He catches Sam's eye at one point and almost overfills his own glass, but Sam catches him at the last minute, shooting him a warning look. 

""Sorry,"" Bucky murmurs, setting the pitcher down and taking a seat. 

""You're all nerves today, man, you gotta calm down,"" Sam teases. 

""Who wouldn't be on edge, taking orders from you all day?"" Bucky replies, smiling. 

Sarah looks between them and shakes her head. ""Boys never really grow up do they?"" 

""No this one,"" Sam says, pointing a thumb in Bucky's direction before taking a bite of his salmon. ""Then again, man's a hundred and six and doesn't look a day over thirty."" 

Bucky rolls his eyes. ""I'm young for my age, what can I say."" 

Sam snorts, and the rest of the meal continues on with ease. The food is delicious -- there's no doubt that Sam and Sarah had inherited their parents' cooking skills -- the conversation flows easily, and by the end of it, Bucky's full to bursting, overwhelmed with gratitude.

""We'll do the dishes,"" he offers when everyone's plates are empty and a comfortable quiet has fallen over the table. The boys are out back now, their voice carrying faintly through the windows and into the house.

""Oh, he's volunteering me for things now,"" Sam says, mock outraged, but standing up nonetheless to help Bucky start to clear the plates. 

""I take it back,"" Sarah says, standing up. ""You should bring friends over more often if you're going to be such a gentleman."" 

""I'm  always  a gentleman,"" Sam argues.

""Let's go Samuel,"" Bucky says, guiding him to the kitchen, stacks of plates in his metal hand. 

From the living room, he hears Sarah cackling at the use of her brother's full name, and Bucky beams. 

Cleaning up is quick work when you can carry as much as Bucky can in so few trips, and soon he's washing dishes and passing them over to his right for Sam to dry. They're quiet while they work, and Bucky's struck once again by how easy it all feels, being here with Sam. 

 Is this what friends are like?  

He's forced to ask himself the same question again and again, because how he feels for Sam is starting to feel increasingly less like friendship and more like-- 

""I think my sister wants to keep you around,"" Sam says, cutting into Bucky's thoughts. He's smiling in that way he has, like you're the only thing on his mind, and Bucky blinks a few times before he answers. 

Definitely not friendship, he realizes with a flip of his stomach. Far from it, in fact. 

""That's... nice,"" Bucky says lamely. He can't put it into words, how it feels to have Sam stand in front of him and tell him his family wants him to stay. This is what he's wanted all along, right? People he can trust, and count on, and, hopefully, who could count on him, too. 

That's what Raynor had meant when she'd told him to cultivate friendships, after all. And now here he is, he's done that, and maybe he's even gotten Sam to see him as a friend, too, and he's definitely going to ruin it, standing here in the Wilson's kitchen, overthinking himself into a stroke. 

""Uh, I thought so..."" Sam says, looking at Bucky, a confused expression on his face. ""You look like you just ate a sour grape though, so...""

""No sour grapes,"" Bucky says, forcing a smile onto his face. ""Dinner was great. I'm glad the boat's in good shape, too."" 

""Me too,"" Sam says, narrowing his eyes like he knows what's about to come next. 

""And Sarah's wonderful, really. But--""

""Oh here we go,"" Sam says, rolling his eyes.

""I should go,"" Bucky continues. ""I got a hotel room, so...""

Sam glowers at him. ""I  told  you you could stay here.""

""I appreciate that,"" Bucky nods. ""But I really think I should go. It's for the best.""

""The best for who, man? Not you. You're happier than I've seen you maybe ever. At no point today did I see you staring off into the middle distance like you might just vanish into it."" 

Does he do that? Bucky has to assume it's true. Sam can read him like a book, it's one of his many talents, and Bucky tries to push the thought away. 

""The best for everyone,"" Bucky says. He tries to side step Sam, but he moves at just the right time, blocking Bucky's path with his body, wide chest and shoulders radiating that same warmth as before, and as much as Bucky wants to sink into that warmth, he knows, deep down, leaving is for the best. 

""It's like that, huh?"" Sam asks, still not moving from Bucky's path. 

""Like what?"" 

"" Better for everyone, like you suddenly know what's best for me? Did you even ask? I told you Sarah wanted you to stay, and your response to that is saying that you should go. Help me make sense of that,"" Sam dares him. 

Bucky's being a coward, and he knows that. Sam deserves better. Deserves an explanation at the very least, but Bucky isn't sure how to separate that from everything else going on in his head, screaming that he's going to ruin everything.

""I need some air,"" he says. 

Bucky hears Sam heave a sigh as he sidesteps him, walking through the living room and out the front door to the porch. 

Of course he doesn't  actually  want to leave. He drops into one of the white wooden rocking chairs on the porch and lets himself sit in the quiet. Bucky thinks of his apartment, newly full of furniture and yet no less empty, still lacking the kind of warmth he can find just inside. The thought of going back to it makes him miss Sam with a fierceness he didn't think himself capable of, not after Steve.

Sam had said it earlier, hadn't he? Bucky's flighty. And maybe that's because of everything he's been through, or something that came with Steve leaving, or 70 years without any real, meaningful relationships, but he wants to change that. He'd come all this way, and Sam had looked at him like he couldn't believe that after all this, Bucky would really shut him out. 

Again. 

Bucky's standing up, turning toward the house when the door opens, and there's Sam. 

""Figured you weren't getting too far without that backpack of yours,"" Sam says quietly. 

Bucky nods, looking at him. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said all that stuff about leaving. I don't know what's best for you and your family. Obviously, I barely know what's best for me at this point."" 

""I know,"" Sam says. ""But thanks."" He gestures to the chair Bucky had just vacated, and sinks into the one right beside it, their knees touching when Bucky sits back down. 

The light from the porch is dim, illuminating the soft planes of Sam's face. There's crickets out there, too, and they really aren't in the city anymore, out here in the quiet, just off the water, in the thick of the Louisiana summer. When Bucky turns, Sam's studying him, the moonlight glinting in his brown eyes in a way that makes Bucky want to drown in them. 

""So,"" Sam says. 

""So,"" Bucky repeats. He isn't sure what to say now. It's not like he could confess all of his confusion to Sam just like that. 

""You want to share with the class, or are you gonna make me guess,"" Sam asks. 

Bucky wants to say that there's nothing  to  share, but he doesn't want to lie any more than he wants to leave, and god, relationships are hard. Because that's what this is, for better or worse, friendship or... more than that, someday, maybe. His relationship with Sam is one of the best and most stable in his life right now, and he isn't going to throw that away. 

""I get overwhelmed, sometimes,"" Bucky says instead. 

""Tell me about it,"" Sam says, smiling faintly, and Bucky laughs a little, because of course, Sam gets it. Maybe not all of it, but enough, more than anyone else. Maybe that's what Raynor saw from day one. Bucky always was a little slow on the uptake. 

""I'm not good at this, and I really... I don't want to make this weird for you or your family.""

""Man, I've got a hundred and six year-old dude with a metal arm on my front porch, half the population vanished for five years, and the majority of our friends are nowhere to be seen or heard from again. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it'll always be a little weird.""

He had a point. 

""Okay,"" Bucky says, taking a deep breath. ""You're right, it's a little weird, a lot of the time."" 

""Exactly,"" Sam says, meeting Bucky's eye for a long moment. ""So, no need to run out on your good friend Sam."" 

He says it like a challenge, that word,  friend . It's what brought Bucky here, it's what started them down this path all those months ago, and now, Sam's looking at him just like he did that day in D.C. 

 Come on, be my friend, Buck, I dare you. I double dare you. Bucky can still hear the words in the back of his mind, and unless he's reading things entirely wrong, then... 

""You know,"" Bucky says, eyes growing wide.

""What do I know?"" Sam asks innocently. 

Bucky fixes him with his best  I was the Winter Soldier  stare, which just makes Sam laugh. It should be infuriating and maybe it would be if Bucky wasn't so--

""I hate you,"" Bucky mutters, even as he's unable to keep the smile from his face. 

""Oh, I think you have the opposite problem, Buck,"" Sam says, grinning. 

""You're gonna make me say it,"" Bucky says. 

""Damn right.""

""I don't think I want to be friends,"" Bucky says. 

Sam's smile widens, but he stays quiet. 

""At least, not just friends,"" Bucky finishes. ""I wanted to... I don't know, deserve your friendship, because you're like, absurdly perfect, when you're not being the worst, and then along the way--"" Bucky trails off, getting to his feet and looking at Sam, determined, for once, to say everything he needs to say. ""You make me crazy in a good way."" 

In front of him, Sam's still smiling, and getting to his feet, too, his gaze never leaving Bucky's. It's wonderful and too much and not enough at the same time. 

""Crazy in a good way,"" Sam repeats. ""That's one way of putting it."" He lets his hand come to rest on Bucky's jaw, his hands smooth and surprisingly soft and Bucky feels his breath catch. ""The question is,"" Sam continues, drawing Bucky in so close his heart was probably at risk of giving out, ""what are you going to do about it?""

Bucky swallows, takes a sharp, shallow breath, and closes the last remaining space between them, bringing their lips together slowly, a quick press of lips testing the waters. He wants to be sure, once and for all, that Sam wants this too. He wants to give him the chance to pull back, but instead, Bucky feels Sam's hands venture down from his face to his hip as he deepens the kiss like it's the most natural thing in the world. 

Maybe it is; maybe everything they've been doing up to now, every conversation, every admission and small moment of give and take had been building to this: Sam's lips, warm and wet and perfect on his, both of them drenched in moonlight and the distant sounds of crickets and waves lapping at the shore while Sam's hands held them firmly in place. 

Sam tilts Bucky's chin up expertly, kisses him slowly and deeply enough that Bucky's mind is entirely blank, empty aside from the chorus of  yes, more, this.  

When they finally break apart, they stand there, neither moving an inch, breathing together in the dark. 

""I'm glad I stayed,"" Bucky says eventually. He's never been more glad about anything maybe ever. 

""Me too,"" Sam tells him with a smile. ""Knew you wouldn't get far."" 

""Yeah, yeah,"" Bucky says with a roll of his eyes. ""I get it, you're a lot faster on the uptake,"" he adds. ""Seriously, when did you figure it out?""

""When I was in Sweden and came back to find Mr. Snow Miser had been pining for me,"" Sam explains, grinning at him once again. 

Bucky gapes at him. ""I didn't even know it then!"" 

This earns him a laugh. ""I know,"" Sam says. ""But I knew you'd catch up eventually."" 

""Well,"" Bucky says thoughtfully, ""I have a lot of time to make up for, making you wait like that."" He lets his gaze fall to Sam's lips before looking back up. A part of him can't believe it had taken him this long to open his eyes, but then again. The journey had been more than worth it. 

""I've got time,"" Sam says, ""and I'm not going anywhere."" 

Bucky didn't know he needed to hear those words until they left Sam's mouth, but they make him feel lighter, somehow. He nods, a quiet agreement, and when he leans in and kisses him again, it feels something like a promise. 

 I'm not going anywhere . "

Sometimes he wondered if they'd purposefully assigned him a therapist whose office was three hours by train from New York. Like it was part of his atonement. Making him sit quietly with his dark thoughts while the world sped past him on the other side of dirty glass.

Or maybe they just wanted him to move closer. Who could say?

Sam had a place in D.C. didn't he? Not that it mattered, or that he cared, or anything.

""Something on your mind, James?"" Dr. Raynor said, breaking the usual start-of-session silence.

Too many things. But he could narrow it down for her. He was generous that way. ""Dr. Raynor, I just think...""

""Yes?""

He dug himself deeper into the couch cushions, entrenched and ready.

""I think it was messed up, you bringing Sam into one of our sessions."" Okay, maybe not so much with the generosity. But he was made for fighting, after all. ""Without even asking me first.""

""I understand why you would feel that way,"" she said.

""Oh good, you understand. That means a lot.""

""Sarcasm is not a productive way to express your emotions, James."" 

Bucky bristled, like a school kid being scolded, and crossed his arms over his chest. ""You could've asked first, that's all.""

""Yes. I agree, actually,"" she admitted, though not at all contritely. ""I acted hastily. I apologize for overstepping. At the time, with your freedom a little bit on the iffy side--"" She swiveled her hand in the universal gesture of uncertainty. ""--it seemed like the best way, at the time, to work through the underlying conflict.""

""Underlying conflict,"" he repeated, trying very hard not to roll his eyes. 

She made a face as if to say, sarcasm again. 

Fine. Fine. He shook his head and looked at the wall. ""We were there fighting super soldiers on top of moving trucks, that seems like pretty overt conflict to me, Doctor."" He kept looking at the wall. It was blank and comforting. ""Bringing Sam in to see all my... bullshit, it doesn't really help with that.""

He didn't care if anyone thought he was weak, or broken, or anything like that. Because he was those things. He thought instead of the look on Sam's face before he'd left their impromptu shared session. How he seemed just that much further away from Bucky. Whatever connection they'd built, tenuous at best, snapped clean through by Bucky's insecurities and his indictments and his inability to keep his stupid mouth shut. 

Strangers again, with a common square-headed enemy, but not much else.

""James,"" Dr. Raynor said, and he finally tore his gaze away from the wall to look at her. ""You're the one who missed a session because you'd decided to jump on--and out of--a plane with him, spur of the moment."" Her left hand imperceptibly clutched her notebook closer to her lap. An unspoken threat she knew he'd see. ""Let's talk about that.""

His arms crossed a little bit tighter over his chest. 

""I was mad at him,"" he said. That was it. Truly. Talking complete shit about wizards. Not that he'd ever try to explain that non-sequitur to Dr. Raynor.

""And this was your reaction to being mad at him?"" she asked, voice as cool and unengaged as ever. See? that coolness was saying. You can tell me anything because I don't really care. He knew better than to fall for it. She caught his eye and dared him to look away again. ""Throwing yourself into harm's way?""

""Harm's--?"" He shook his head. ""Look, Doctor, I'm pretty much indestructible. If you think this was some kind of self-punishment, some kind of masochistic... whatever, that would be a pretty dumb way for me to go about it.""

It was like he could feel his buttons being pushed, one by one, and he was helpless to stop it. She may have been evil, some offshoot of Zola's A.I. computer. The jury was still out on that.

""So,"" she said, in her evil robotic way, ""it was about protecting him. Making sure he didn't get hurt, even when you were mad at him."" She made an impressed kind of face, flipped her notebook open and wrote something down, short and quick, nodding with self-satisfaction.

""No. I didn't say that."" He unfolded his arms to wag a metal finger at her sharply. ""Stop doing that.""

""You and Sam. You're partners, right?""

Bucky shifted uncomfortably. Push, push, push those buttons, lady android. 

""I don't know if I'd use that word, in particular.""

They were... mutual acquaintances? Who saved each other's asses on occasion? Or were they just Steve's discarded wingmen, like that slack-jawed, dead-eyed, helmet-wearing impostor had said. That dick. Bucky crossed his arms again.

""Do you have a preferred label?"" Dr. Raynor asked. ""Have you and Sam discussed it? That could actually be a big contribution to the root of your conflict."" 

The notebook was open again. Fuck that thing.

""Discussed it? No. We don't discuss. He talks too much. I can barely listen.""

""James. Relationships are a two-way street. You should try harder to engage with him when he reaches out to you.""

Bucky didn't say anything, mostly because it felt like he couldn't. How was he supposed to contribute to a conversation that was speeding away from him at a hundred miles an hour while he sat on his thumb at the train station and fumbled over the word relationship. But Dr. Raynor didn't seem to care. She just kept at it, like he was a hangnail she needed to chew off.

""This lack of communication--has it affected your intimacy at all?""

The train came to a screeching halt. Smoke wafted off the fire-hot brakes.

""My what?"" 

""I know, I know,"" Dr. Raynor said, placating, both hands up. ""We usually don't get into the topic. And this may be a conversation I should have with the both of you here."" She smiled at him, soft and entreating. She'd never looked more menacing. ""I am asking your permission this time, by the way.""

""For Sam--Sam Wilson--"" He laughed, incredulous. ""--to come to another one of my legally-mandated therapy sessions?"" What a terrible fucking idea. ""Why would he even agree to that?""

That look on Sam's face the last time. Bucky couldn't stop thinking about it. How he'd ruined something, even if he didn't know what.

""That's a good question,"" Dr. Raynor said. ""Why do you think he agreed last time?""

""I don't know. Probably to piss me off.""

""Do you really believe that?""

""I mean. No. Maybe.""

""You don't think it's because he cares about you?""

He hated the walls in this place, actually. How could he have ever thought that their blankness had brought him comfort before.

""James. Do you believe that Sam cares about you?""

And the ceiling. What a dumb ceiling.

The soft tap-tap-tapping sound of Dr. Raynor's pen on the leather covering of her notebook threatened him again. He ignored it. Bravely.

""Because--and I know I don't have to tell you this--it's extremely important for a functioning relationship that both partners are assured of the other's feelings for them.""

Tap. Tappity tap.

""James.""

He sighed out through his nose, and tried to rewind back through the conversation. What on earth was she talking about? He knew he sometimes got a little too sensitive about the generational differences between all these young kids like Dr. Raynor and his 'stuffy' old ways, as she might say, but the way they just... talked about feelings all the time, like nothing was private or personal anymore. He didn't get it. It was like those weird white sticks people jammed into their ears. There was no way it could feel good or could be useful in any way, and yet everybody seemed to do it.

""We don't really... talk about stuff like that.""

""So it's all just physical? Because that's okay, too, as long as you're both on the same page about it.""

""Dr. Raynor, I don't want to talk about this."" Mostly because it was more of her modern day mumbo jumbo, and he was more confused than he'd like to admit.

""Well, I think it's necessary. From everything we've talked about before, it's very clear to me that Sam is an important part of your life. After your efforts to make amends, maybe the second most important part."" Her hands were up again, palms out, an offering of understanding.

He shook his head. ""It's not like that.""

""Like what?""

""I--"" 

Because even with those offered hands, he didn't think she'd ever understand. Not in any way that he could explain.

""James.""

But he guessed he had to try.

""Look. We both had a connection to Steve. And now that he--now that that connection is gone, it's like... you know when you put two cuts of string in a drawer, and they just, they get all tangled up somehow?""

She sat up straighter. ""You want to talk Knot Theory with me? I'm listening.""

""Well, it's like. I don't know. Steve was the only family I had left."" He stopped there for a moment. He needed to compose his thoughts so he didn't reveal too much. Yeah, he was bad at therapy. It wasn't like both he and Dr. Raynor weren't painfully aware of that already. He just... didn't want to see the look on her face if he admitted that he didn't even blame Steve for going. How that would make the proverbial light bulb go off, like she could crack him, finally. If he admitted that, given the opportunity himself, Bucky would probably pop off to a time when he didn't really exist, too.

But those were 'inside' thoughts, as he'd started categorizing them. One of those tricky suckers had already escaped during their session with Sam, and that had been pretty much terrible for everyone involved.

""Keep going,"" Dr. Raynor prompted, as if she was already aware of all his defensive tactics, as if she was familiar with him or something. She was, he had to admit, marginally better than him at therapy. Marginally.

""And now,"" he said, clearing his throat a little. ""Now it's just me, and I don't, I don't really like when it's just me? So there's... Sam. You know what I'm saying?""

""I can make an educated guess. You both loved Steve--"" He nodded, begrudgingly, and she smiled, but a little sad. ""--and you both feel a gap where he used to be. And maybe trying to fill that gap with each other, without actually talking about it, or trying to make a new space for the person you're with now, is causing you both to lash out."" She rested one end of the capped pen on her chin and leaned forward, one of her transparent tricks to emphasize that he really needed to listen now. ""Because you're angry that the other person isn't who you lost. And that's not fair to either one of you. Or in any way healthy.""

""I guess?"" A desperate thought: If he agreed, maybe she'd drop it. Because this felt worse than ramming white plastic sticks in his ears could ever.

""Listen. James. It's very important that you know, for sure, if you want to be with Sam or if you just miss Steve.""

""If I want to be with Sam,"" he repeated, as if the words would make more sense a second time. 

""If you want him in your life.""

His stomach churned. Like it was his choice? Like people didn't just up and leave on their own whether he wanted them to or not? Like he was worth staying for?

Inside thoughts, all of them.

""Look,"" he said, finally. He had to distance himself from this whole topic somehow. ""Sam's a good guy. I know I give him grief, and I don't know why. He doesn't deserve it. Maybe..."" He let out a big breath, hoping, unsuccessfully, that it would be cleansing somehow. ""Maybe I should just leave him alone.""

""Again, this would be so much easier if he were here, and you could say this to him directly, and hear if that's what he wants.""

Well that was a terrible idea. He wouldn't even grace it with a response. 

Dr. Raynor leaned back in her chair again. A move to show how completely non-aggressive whatever passive-aggressive thing that came out of her mouth next would be. ""You know,"" she said, casual as can be, ""you never answered my question, before.""

""Which one?"" He thought he'd dodged about ten by now. But she was an evil A.I.; she'd catalogued them all for sure.

""Your physical intimacy with Sam. How is that going? Is it going?""

Uh, no. Being physical with Sam? He didn't really think about it. Not the way Sam's legs had felt sandwiched between his during their joint therapy session. Sturdy and warm and mocking and clever.

Or the way Sam had crashed into him under that semi truck. His arms a protective shield around him as they tumbled through the sun-warmed grass. The feel of his chest breathing, up and down, up and down, under Bucky's.

The way the round bulge of his shoulder would graze against Bucky when they sat next to each other, too close, but somehow not close enough.

The reassurance of his strong hand slapping his arm or grasping his neck, letting him know, I'm here with you, we're together in this.

""I don't see how that's relevant,"" he said, looking to the side.

""You don't see how physical intimacy can impact your relationship?""

""Honestly, I don't. Look."" How did anyone survive the twenty-first century walking around being this open and touchy feely? Did no one have any protections anymore? How were they strutting around with their hearts all open and exposed and not getting completely bruised up? Physical intimacy. Relationships. Kids to-fucking-day. Just touching each other all easy because they didn't have any fucking cares in the world. Didn't they know how dangerous that was? How dangerous everything around them was?

""It's okay to be touched,"" she said, completely unhelpfully. 

""Dr. Raynor. I know what you're thinking. But just because I'm a hundred years old doesn't mean I'm repressed, okay. It's just..."" No, no, no, get back inside, thought, back where you belong. His left hand clenched. ""I don't like touching people, alright?"" Because for so long, touching meant killing. Meant the chair. Meant pain. ""Why are you bringing this up? You know I don't like talking about this. You know it doesn't help me."" 

He kept telling her, but she never listened.

""And you don't like it when Sam touches you?""

He paused. Opened his mouth and waited for something, anything to come out. 

Raynor continued. ""Have you told him this?""

He thought of Sam's laugh, then. How it always made him feel a little off-balance, lightheaded, with its genuineness, its openness, its generosity. Even when it was at Bucky's expense, there was a soothing afternote to it, rubbing away the sting almost immediately.

He thought about how he'd felt a different kind of lightheadedness when Sam's knee had knocked against his in that dark little police station room, before he'd walked out, angry and disappointed. Bucky's heart had thumped with a sense of wonder, combined with a sense of loss. How he'd wanted Sam to come back, bring back all that warmth, tangle up their strings again.

""I don't... not like it,"" he said, throat suddenly dry. ""With Sam.""

""Again,"" Dr. Raynor said, enunciating each syllable, ""have you told him this?""

""Why would I ever tell him that?"" Bucky said, gesturing vaguely in front of him. ""He'd just... he wouldn't get it. You saw how he was with--with the chairs."" 

He sounded like an idiot, he knew. But that sense of loss, it--maybe--haunted him.

""So, and I know you'll think this is prying,"" Dr. Raynor said, apology already in her tone, ""but I'm really just trying to help here. So. What do you two do about sex?""

""Sex."" There was suddenly a loud buzzing noise in his brain.

""Yes.""

""With other people?""

""With each other, James.""

""We... don't. Do that."" 

Yeah, yeah, it was the twenty-first century, he knew he had to get with the program already, he really wasn't repressed, but were these kids really out there just having sex with each other all willy nilly? Probably, actually. The very forward messages he'd received on the online dating sites had pretty much proven that.

The pen was back at Dr. Raynor's chin. Pay attention, boy-o. ""But do you want to?""

""I--uh.""

Yes, said a very assertive inside thought. Yes we do.

""You know, James, it seems to me that the root of your conflict with Sam stems from this lack of intimacy, both emotional and maybe physical, too?""

""So you're saying I should--that we should--?"" He didn't think this was what therapy was going to be like when he first started, that was for sure. One more thing to add to the to-do list, he guessed. ""And this will make me feel better?"" 

Aside from the obvious ways sex did that, of course.

Dr. Raynor perked up, like he'd just made her day. ""I'm saying you two need to talk about it. And if you really want that talk to have any forward movement at all, it should be here. In this space, where you can't duck and feint away from each other.""

Bucky frowned, but he was also nodding.







The television droned in the background as Bucky sat on the floor of his empty apartment, a sports talk show with aggressively confident men in suits sitting in what looked like the command deck of a spaceship.

Another session with Sam. Just the thought of it gave Bucky heartburn. How was he even supposed to bring it up? Last time had been easy, all things considered; someone had said sit here and they both sat there. Good little soldiers.

He pulled his phone out of his pocket and glared at it. Like it was the phone's fault for being the likely conveyance for this bedeviled task. Stupid phone.

In some sick form of retaliation, the phone cheerily buzzed at him. ""New text message from Sam Wilson.""


Keeping yourself out of trouble?


It was the kind of meaningless text Sam usually sent. The kind they both knew Bucky wouldn't respond to.

Let no one ever say James Bucky Barnes wasn't dedicated to his mental health journey. He breathed out through his nose and started tapping out a reply. It took at least five minutes to compose. How could anyone think these things were convenient?


I'm coming back down to D.C. for (more) therapy on Tuesday. Raynor wants you there too. You don't have to.


He barely had time to close the phone before it buzzed again with a reply. 


He's alive. He speaks.


Bucky snapped the phone shut again and put it away, with maybe more emphasis than was required for an audience of no one. Maybe a stoic silence would end the conversation, so he wouldn't have to.

Ten minutes later, the phone buzzed one more time.


What time? I'll be there.








Sam met Bucky in the waiting room. It was a nice room. The chairs were large and comfortable and the artwork was tasteful, calming. A nice, placid color on the walls. Bucky didn't look at Sam. He chewed on his lips and squeezed the fingers of his right hand between the metal ones on his left.

""Sam. James."" Dr. Raynor opened the door to her office and called them in. Sam stood up and casually tugged Bucky by the sleeve, herding him in behind him.

""Dr. Raynor,"" Bucky said, sitting down on one end of the couch. He could have scooted a little further down, to make more room for Sam, but he didn't.

When Sam sat next to him, one warm thigh almost right up against his, Bucky breathed out and unclenched his hands. He hadn't even realized they were clenched. What was he, fifteen years old?

""I guess I'm... flattered to be here again?"" Sam rubbed the flats of his palms against his legs. Nervous, maybe, trying to relieve tension. Bucky wasn't sure how he felt about that.

""James, why don't you begin,"" Dr. Raynor said. Helpful as always. 

Bucky squinted at her, before turning toward Sam with the whole upper half of his body. The movement pushed their legs closer together.

He smiled, one of his really terrible grimaced smiles that made people very uncomfortable. He didn't know what else to do. ""Dr. Raynor thinks you and I should have sex. With each other."" He reached over and awkwardly thwacked his right hand on one of Sam's, resting now on those remarkably hard, denim-covered quadriceps. ""I think it's... yeah. We could, maybe? Someplace else, though. Not here. Like, not in front of her. Or right now."" Bucky glanced at her a little desperately then. ""Right?""

She didn't exactly look happy with his attempt, but she also looked like she was maybe trying not to laugh. Very professional. 

He turned back to Sam. ""So...?""

As far as karmic punishments went, he thought the awful silence that followed was pretty fair.

Sam stared down at their hands, still touching. He cinched his lips tightly together, nodding, then popped his mouth open with a smack, said ""okay,"" stood up, and walked right out of the office.

Bucky watched him go, mind completely whited out. 

""Well,"" he said absently to the door. ""That went well.""

""James.""

""What?"" He felt oddly deflated. Not even mad. ""This is all such bullshit. I don't know why you make me humiliate myself like this. Is this fun for you?"" The old accusation was rote, no feeling behind it.

""James."" She looked at him. She smiled one of those impatient, patronizing smiles teachers used to use on the slower kids who weren't quite getting how long division worked. He got those a lot. ""He said okay.""

""What?"" Oh. ""Oh.""

He said... Oh.

""Obviously, you both need to do so much more talking, but--""

Bucky hopped up off the couch. ""Yeah, okay, goodbye Dr. Raynor, see you next week."" He rushed out the door, but thought to poke his head back in at the last second. ""This still counts as a full session, yeah?""

Dr. Raynor sighed, rolling her eyes. ""Fine, yes.""

He slapped the door jamb on the way out.





 

Sam was waiting for him outside the building. They took the metro back to Sam's D.C. apartment, and okay, yeah, maybe kissing Sam, then making out with him, Bucky's back pushed up against the wall while they necked, and falling together onto Sam's big bed, those crisp clean sheets, jerking him off, and getting jerked off by him, was kind of great, and maybe Dr. Raynor knew what she was talking about sometimes.

But only sometimes.

Sam hadn't even been weirded out that Bucky didn't try to touch him with his metal arm, that he'd just kept his left hand planted against Sam's headboard while his right had gone to work between their bodies, making Sam say the sweetest fucking things beneath him, in between kisses, the secret softie. 

Afterwards, as he lay on those crisp, no-longer-clean sheets, he thought to himself, a little madly, that it was really fucking great that his therapist's office was all the way down in D.C. 

Sam was lying on his stomach, one arm thrown over Bucky's torso. ""So, that therapist of yours,"" he said, slightly out of breath. Which was hot; Bucky felt good about that. ""Strange ideas, huh?""

""Strange woman,"" Bucky replied. ""I think... you know what?"" He sat up a little bit, but not enough to dislodge Sam's warm, warm arm. ""I think she thinks we've been dating? This whole time?""

""Hmm."" Sam angled his head on the pillow and sent him a look, very easy to read: And who exactly do you think gave her that idea? before smiling, slow and pleased and affectionate. 

Bucky's heart started thumping. 

""You mean you didn't figure that out either of the two times she literally asked us to do couples therapy together?"" Sam said.

Bucky laughed, short and hard. Oh God. She had. He brought his hand up to his face.

""Clearly not,"" he said, wiping at his eyes. He couldn't stop laughing. He felt giddy. He hadn't felt giddy since 1943.

Sam scooted himself a little closer, used his arm around Bucky to tug him the rest of the way until they were chest to chest. ""'Strange woman,' he says. Smart lady, I say.""

Bucky smirked at him, and looked down at his mouth. ""Smartass, I say.""

""Shut up and get over here,"" Sam said, which didn't even make sense, because they were already on top of each other practically. ""I got some ass for you.""

Bucky shrugged against him, and smiled, sarcastic. ""Yeah, alright."" 

This time when he kissed Sam he realized, but only through a deep, contented haze, that his left hand was cupping Sam's jaw.

Only one bad guy left, and he was currently engaged with Barnes on a rooftop. Sam did another round, looking for an opportunity to assist. It wasn't needed. Barnes was, for all his faults, one hell of a fighter--fists flying one after the other, metal arm angling toward all the baddie's most vulnerable parts. There was a rhythm to it--punch, block, punch, block. And then the bad guy grabbed at Barnes's jacket with clawed gloves, ripping through the leather and leaving a bloody gash between his shoulder blades. That was when Sam dove, getting there just in time to watch Barnes straight toss the guy over the edge, already reaching around to feel for the mangled leather.

""This was my favorite fucking jacket.""

""Yeah, well we'll call a tailor later. The rest of them are headed for some kind of compound about twenty miles from here.""

""GodDAMMIT.""

 

 

Their ride was a ""borrowed"" Mazda MX-5 that Bucky smashed into and hot-wired before Sam could slide across the hood and get a seatbelt on.

""Watch your side of the road,"" Bucky said, already whipping the car away from the hot mess of a scene behind them. For a while, everything was the roar of the engine and Sam screaming at him because ""There's a truck over here. There's a truck! You can't fit this car into that gap, oh FUUUck!""

""Calm down. If I kill us, you can be pissed at me in hell.""

""Oh, I will not be there with you in hell. You're on your fucking own.""

""Oh pal, but what kind of hell would it be without you?""

""Get fu--""

Bucky laid on the car horn, the sound blaring through the cabin while a red minivan puttered down the passing lane at 50 miles-per-hour.

Next to him, Sam watched Bucky's gaze shoot around the highway. He did not like that look in Bucky's eyes. He did not like it at all.

""Hang on!""

""No! No, do not do what--SHIT, SHIT.""

Bucky swung around the minivan into oncoming traffic, a diesel flying at them and laying on its own horn.

""Barnes. BARNES!""

The Mazda engine purred like a mutant tiger, Barnes's ass coming up off the seat while he laid his full weight on the gas.

In that moment, Sam did what any normal superhero would do. He shut his eyes tight and gripped the ever-living hell out of Bucky's well-toned thigh until he felt the Mazda careen back onto the right side of the goddamned road.

""You are. A fucking madman.""

""Ha! And you're not?!"" Bucky swerved again. ""'What's the plan?' I asked. 'Buck, I have a plan,' he said. Fuck.""

""That was six months ago!""

""And it's STILL BULLSHIT.""

""Oh my GOD.""

""Yeah, well...""

""No. Oh my God!"" Sam pointed at an 18-wheeler up ahead, one of the bad guys they were chasing standing on top with what very much appeared to be a rocket launcher.

""Take the wheel.""

""Are you fucking--?"" But Bucky had already turned on intelligent cruise control and climbed halfway out of the window, and the Mazda was swerving dangerously toward a yellow SUV. Sam's hand shot for the steering wheel.

""Just keep it steady.""

Several cars honked around them. Sam glanced at the yellow SUV again and found the driver holding on at 10 and 2 with both hands, his shoulders up to his ears. He also found Bucky's reflection in the passenger side window of said SUV, Bucky leaned out with a pistol in his hand.

""Take the shot,"" Sam hissed, eyes on the masked baddie atop the big truck. ""Take the shot, take the shot, take the shot.""

Gunfire cracked, and the baddie fell down holding their knee cap, the RPG falling off the truck and onto the shoulder of the highway, where it then rolled into a ditch. Mile marker 73. Sam brought his hand to his mouth.

""This is Sam Wilson to HQ. State highway 57. Mile 73. There's a rocket launcher in the ditch now. Probably most definitely loaded.""

Sharon's voice met his ears. ""Been trying to catch up with you, Cap. I'm 10 miles back. I've got it.""

Bucky crawled back into the car, meeting Sam's eyes.

""Nice shot.""

""Thanks,"" Bucky said, and then he disabled cruise control and shot in front of the yellow SUV before speeding off.

It was quick when they finally got to the compound. There were reinforcements from the agency-formerly-known-as-SHIELD. Sharon showed up with the rocket launcher. For Bucky, that was like handing a stick of dynamite to someone trying to open a locked door. Overkill, but it got the job well done if you didn't much care about making a mess.

In the end, they stumbled back to the Mazda that now had a giant Sam-sized dent in the side from where some asshole threw him into the door. Sam grabbed the shield--embedded in the back windshield--and slid into the passenger seat. Seeing as there were already people tracking down the owner to let them know they were about to receive a shiny new Whatever the Fuck They Wanted courtesy of the government, he and Barnes figured they might as well drive it home.

Only Barnes didn't drive it home. Barnes drove it off the first exit on their way toward home, pulling onto a parking space outside of a Target.

""Bucky, please tell me why I'm not halfway to a hot bath right now.""

""We're over two hundred miles from home. I need a shirt.""

Sam was going to murder him. Sam was going to murder him and leave his body in a functional-yet-stylish storage cube somewhere inside the store.

""You need a shirt.""

""You can wait in the car.""

""And miss out on seeing what's in the $1-3 bins? I don't fucking think so.""

Bucky threw up his hands and skulked toward the door, Sam carrying the shield and his wings and throwing them into the baby seat of the first shopping cart he saw. He found Bucky staring at the in-store Starbucks.

""There are like fifteen people in that line. We're-- Aaand he's gone."" Sam gripped the handle of the shopping cart and took a deep breath, clenching his jaw before inspiration struck. A slow grin spread across his face, and he cupped his hands around his mouth to yell clear across the store. ""I WANT A CARAMEL FRAP, SUNSHINE. LOVE YOU, MY LITTLE WINTER SNOWBALL. I'LL BE IN HOMEGOODS.""

He turned on his heel and took two steps before Bucky's voice caught him like a bear trap.

""SURE THING, POOKIE BEAR. SMOOCHES. MUAHMUAHMUAH.""

Sam scrubbed a hand down his face and wondered what kind of lawyer he could afford these days. Probably not one good enough to explain the meticulous dismemberment.

 

 

Barnes caught up to him in health and beauty where Sam had been contemplating several containers of Epsom salts. One was lavender. It sounded very nice. Honestly, Sam liked being Captain America now that he'd gotten over the weirdness of it all, but he did have a bit of a problem with how often people just threw him at things. He needed to start keeping Aleve in his tac belt. He could pop one en route to a fight.

To Barnes's credit, he did push a caramel frap into Sam's hand, though he did it like he wasn't happy about it.

""Get the eucalyptus mint,"" Barnes said around his straw. He patted his left shoulder. ""Trust me.""

Begrudgingly, Sam put it in the cart and followed Bucky back to the clothing section where he held up two plaid button-ups in different sizes.

""Maybe I should try them on."" Bucky tilted his head.

""If you make me stay in this store long enough for you to try on shirts, I'm gonna shove a Starbucks straw up your--""

""Fine.""

They went through self-checkout. The cashier overseeing the area kept looking at the shield and then at Sam and then at the wings and at Sam. His eyes subtly moved to Bucky's left hand and went wide.

""Hey man, how're you doing?"" Sam waved at him, and his eyes got even bigger, Adam's apple bobbing in his throat.

Out in the parking lot, Bucky stripped out of his jacket and compression tee, attempting to pull the plaid on. It didn't fit. But a couple of people a few cars away were getting a good show. Sam looked at Bucky's chest and stomach. Aside from a little blood and dust, well... If he'd met Bucky at a bar and didn't have time to get to know his personality, he'd probably take him home.

Maybe.

""See, this is why I wanted to try them on.""

Bucky sighed and looked at his metal arm and then the shirt. With a loud rip, he separated the left arm from the rest and slid it on, deftly doing up the buttons. He slid back into the driver's seat with an exhausted sigh.

""Let's go home.""

""Thank fuck for that.""

 

 

Sam stood in the middle of their local Target with a throw pillow in each hand. The one in his left hand was butter-soft and matched the drapes in the living room, but Bucky had walked by five seconds ago and declared the one on the right ""absolutely fucking hideous,"" and so now Sam kind of wanted it more than he had ever wanted anything.

Barnes was right though. It was pretty terrible. It kind of looked like something that might happen if a Penske truck slammed into an industrial embroidery machine. But...

Sam stared at both pillows a little longer, then grabbed another of the nice ones, tossing it and the other two pillows, good and hideous alike, into the cart.

Hey, accent pillows were good. They added a pop.

He found Bucky a few aisles away, feeling up the bedsheets.

""Seriously?"" Bucky eyed the cart.

""What? I think it's nice."" Sam picked up the ugly pillow and turned it over in his hands while Barnes squinted at him.

Sam had an okay poker face against the average person, but Barnes wasn't the average person, and Sam could tell the moment that Bucky knew he was lying. Bucky wouldn't call him on it though. Instead, he'd hold onto it for later, like that person who hoarded all their Uno reverse and draw cards until the most devastating possible moment.

""You gonna take those sheets to dinner first?"" Sam asked, watching Bucky absently touch at a set decorated with sharks.

""The ones the agency picked feel like if cardboard and steel wool had some kind of bastard child. I deserve to crawl into a nice bed, maybe bring somebody into that nice bed someday.""

""In that case, you should definitely go with the sharks. Maybe the unicorns.""

""What?"" Bucky turned his head. ""You wouldn't fuck a guy on the softest rainbow unicorn bedsheets?""

Sam raised an eyebrow. Sometimes he forgot that Barnes had fully run out of fucks to give several years ago and would just say things like that. Aloud. In the sacred aisles of a Target.

Sam scrubbed a hand over his face, hating the fact that his brain immediately supplied him with an image of Bucky laid out on said unicorn sheets, legs spread, fingers deep in--

Sam cleared his throat. ""Hey, you know as well as I do if a guy gets as far as your bed, he's not turning around because of your sheets. But unicorns are pretty damn cool.""

Bucky clapped Sam on the shoulder. ""I'm not getting the unicorn sheets."" And then, with the most shit-eating grin imaginable, Bucky reached for a set of sheets in heather gray, covered in cartoon images of Sam soaring through the air in his old Falcon getup. Still smiling and without breaking eye contact, he dropped them on top of the world's ugliest throw pillow where they bounced once and fell onto a magnetic shopping list they'd picked up in the bargain bins. Reverse-skip-draw 4.

""You fuck anybody but me on top of cartoon Sam, Barnes, I better not have to know about it.""

The words came out before Sam really thought them through. With mounting horror, he realized what he was saying as he said it, but he couldn't stop until he'd reached the very end, his lips continuing to move as though he'd somehow make up for the first half of the sentence with a golden fourth-quarter performance.

He did not.

And there in the bedding aisle of a Target, Bucky Barnes looked Sam up and down with a quick flick of his gray-blue eyes, then gave him the kind of crooked grin that had probably broken hearts in dance halls all over Brooklyn back in the day. He brought his right hand up in a lazy salute. ""You got it, Cap.""

Sam did not look at Bucky's ass when he turned around and started pulling the cart behind him.

If he had looked though, well, he would have had to admit that it was a pretty good ass.

Good thing he hadn't.

 

 

Sometimes, it was like he and Bucky took turns having bad nights. There were long periods of time where they'd both sleep through the night. And then, the worst nights--when it was like something in the air had climbed inside their brains to fuck with both of them.

Sam woke up first, sweating and shaking. He could still see Riley in his head, not plummeting to his death as he had in real life, but dissolving into a whirlwind of black ash that formed a dark cloud overhead, blotting out the sun. Sam got up and padded to the bathroom, sticking his mouth under the tap to gulp mouthfuls of water, occasionally scooping some onto his face where it dripped from his chin and cheeks back into the basin.

He dried his face just in time to hear Bucky wake with a shout, his panting audible from down the hall. Bucky padded into the bathroom a few seconds later, hugging himself with one arm, the socket for his metal arm bare.

""You too, huh?"" Bucky asked, his voice rasping out of his throat.

""Yeah."" Sam nodded. ""Me too.""

""Shuri, she... I was him again and she..."" Bucky shook his head and turned the shower on as hot as it would go before climbing under the spray in his pajama pants. ""You?"" he asked, water cascading over his trembling lips.

""Riley."" Sam leaned against the bathroom counter, wringing the now-damp hand towel. ""Courtesy of Thanos.""

Bucky looked down at the tub and nodded several times. ""Do you remember it?""

""The dream?""

""Being gone."" Bucky hugged himself again, resting his back against the shower tiles. ""Sometimes I think I remember you and..."" His brows furrowed together. ""I think we were friends.""

Sam laughed. ""Buck, we're friends now.""

Bucky made brief eye contact with Sam and then looked away before reaching over to turn the water off. ""You think you could...""

""Yeah."" Sam handed him a clean towel. ""I'll be around.""

Sam left Bucky to strip and dry off. He made a pot of coffee because there was no way in hell he was going back to sleep. He was nursing a cup on the sofa when Bucky finally padded out of his bedroom in a pair of joggers and a soft tee, metal arm in place. He plopped down beside Sam on the couch and pulled the hideous throw pillow to his chest, hugging it tight.

""You ever feel like the nightmares will never stop?"" Sam asked before taking a sip. ""Like, I don't know... I guess I keep feeling like I should've stopped dreaming about Riley by now.""

Bucky didn't answer for several seconds. Instead, he drew his feet up onto the couch, his knees pushing against the pillow. Sam turned his head to see if Bucky was even listening or if he'd checked out entirely.

""I still dream about Ma and Pa. My little sisters."" Bucky toyed with a few tassels formed from mismatched embroidery thread. ""For a while, I was glad to even have the nightmares because it took so long to remember their faces after..."" Bucky met Sam's eyes. ""I don't think you ever stop missing people, Sam. And would you even want to if you could?""

Sam looked down into his coffee and took another sip. ""You're right, I wouldn't. Our brains could be a little nicer about it though.""

""Yeah, well..."" Bucky shrugged and put his feet down on the carpet. They sat like that for a while, occasionally speaking but mostly just enjoying the sound of the world slowly waking--the garbage trucks going by as the first dawn rays lightened the sky, the birds beginning to chirp and rustle, the neighbor's dog barking cheerfully when she let him outside.

At one point, Sam felt Bucky press against him and looked over to find that he'd dozed off and slumped into his shoulder, the hideous throw pillow still wrapped in his arms. Sam was debating shoving him off to get another cup of coffee when Bucky opened his eyes and sat back up.

""You wanna get out of here?"" he asked, setting the pillow aside.

Sam looked into his empty coffee cup. ""Yeah, sure, what'd you have in mind?""

And that's how they ended up at Target just past opening, the two of them quietly walking through every aisle of the store while sipping saccharine coffee from the in-store Starbucks. Somewhere in stationery, they decided to nix their training regimen for the day. In homegoods, Bucky grabbed a giant weighted throw, plush and soft and navy blue. It was the only thing they bought besides coffee.

Sam found Bucky buried under that throw in the early afternoon, head pillowed on the two nice throw pillows, the ugly one yet again clutched against his chest as he slept.

Sam couldn't help thinking that if they spooned, they'd both fit on the couch pretty easily.

 

 

Sometimes, the bad guys had an agenda. They wanted to take over the world or get revenge for that time Tony Stark farted in the elevator and made them throw up on their high school prom date.

Other times...

Sam tossed the shield to Bucky again, who used it to hammer a robot centaur through the neck. As far as Sam and Bucky could tell, the robots were programmed to attack anyone wearing the color blue, which boded really well for Bucky--in a dark electric blue tac jacket. And Sam--in one of his Cap uniforms that was dominantly navy.

""Sam!"" The shield flew back at Sam, who caught it and twisted to toss it at a would-be assailant, severing wires and metal along the way. He needed to get airborne, but the wing pack he had with him was blue to match the suit and had been unceremoniously ripped from his back before Bucky could launch a metal fist through a metal face. So here he was, back-to-back with Barnes while the centaurs closed in.

""Fuck, I wish you could fly right now."" Bucky drop-kicked another centaur, buying him just enough space to shoot off a bullet big enough to stop a rhino.

""Yeah, you and me both."" Sam's arms were killing him, the repetitive motions of shooting and bashing and bashing and shooting starting to weigh on his muscles.

""Don't you have a spare?""

""In the damn truck.""

He and Bucky both took out a centaur and whipped their heads. Sam estimated about fifty yards stood between them and the armored truck they'd arrived in. Fifty yards and a whole lot of metal horsedudes. This was not Sam's favorite day on the job.

Nearby, a woman in a blue scarf screamed when a centaur turned its sights on her.

""Lose your scarf!"" Sam yelled as loud as he could.

""Your scarf! Take it off!""

She finally heard them, pulling the blue from her neck and running while the fabric trailed to the sidewalk, the centaur aggressively trampling it with its metal hooves.

""Buck, I've got a plan.""

""Is this an actual plan? Or a jump out of a plane and see how it goes plan?""

""Barnes, this is not the time! And that was a YEAR ago.""

""Yeah, well, some things just stick with you."" Bucky grunted when his fist got stuck in the face of a robot, pulling and pulling until it finally tore free with a loud screeching of metal on metal. ""Hit me. What's the plan?""

Sam grabbed for one of the infinite knives strapped to Bucky's belt and used it to cut off the panel that covered the zipper on his suit, exposing the reinforced mesh that covered his abdominals. ""Can you get me on the back of one of these sons of bitches?""

Bucky looked at the fabric and at Sam's stomach, swallowing thickly before launching his fist right past Sam's face, close enough for Sam to feel the wind before he heard the impact. Bucky shook it free. ""You've got to be kidding me.""

""I think we both know I wish I was.""

Bucky looked around at all the metal centaurs and seemed to lock on a target.

""Shield?"" he asked, and Sam relinquished it. In front of him, Bucky took it and fell into a crouch, putting the shield over his shoulders like some kind of Winter Turtle. ""Hop on, Wilson. One ticket to ride.""

""Oh no, oh no no."" But Sam looked around and, well, fuck. Cursing that one morning jog that led to this being his life, he took three quick steps and hopped onto the shield, Bucky pushing up on it with two hundred and some odd pounds of pure super soldier to send Sam airborne toward one of the centaurs. Sam yelled about eight different curses before wrapping hands around the centaur's neck and miraculously falling onto its back.

Oh, he was gonna have a sore ass for days after this. He was right where he needed to be though. He balled the blue fabric up and threw it at Bucky, the centaur following its arc.

""Arms!"" Sam yelled, and Bucky nodded, tossing him the shield while he grabbed one of the centaur's arms and ripped it from its body in a trail of sparks. Sam bashed the shield through the other shoulder join, leaving the centaur incapable of grabbing at the fabric or Bucky or anything else.

""Hand!"" Bucky reached up with the metal arm, and Sam clasped his hand, dragging him up onto the centaur behind him where he took the fabric panel back from Bucky and held it out in front of the centaur's face, using it as a lure to lead the thing right to the armored truck.

It was all downhill from there, Sam pulling on the wing pack and Bucky taking a sniper position on top of the truck's roof with all of the best guns they had at their disposal. Within the hour, it was done, Sam landing on top of the truck and collapsing in a heap next to Bucky.

""You ever think about changing careers?"" Sam asked. ""I bet accounting is nice. You do some math. You never have a robot punch you in the face on a Saturday afternoon.""

Bucky hummed next to him. ""I used to be an accountant. For Pa's business.""

""Was it nice? I bet it was nice.""

Bucky rolled his head to look at Sam, his eyes looking even bluer for the grime smudged on his face. Oil. The robots leaked a ton of oil depending on how they went down.

""Never know what you've got 'til it's gone and all that."" Bucky sat up. ""The people are better in this line of work.""

""Wait. Was that a compliment?""

Bucky gave him a crooked smile that definitely did not make Sam's stomach flutter beneath the too-exposed panel of mesh. He reached over and patted Sam right on the tummy. ""Buddy, who said I meant you?""

Sam grinned at him, shaking his head. ""You do though. You mean me.""

""Keep telling yourself that, pal."" Bucky grunted and slipped off the back of the truck, hopping onto the cab and then down onto the hood. When his feet hit the ground, he looked up to make sure Sam didn't need a hand.

Sam drove home this time, taking a set of keys offered up by Cameron Klein and sliding into the driver's seat of an armored sedan.

When he saw the Target off the highway, it only seemed natural to pull in.

""Target, huh?"" Bucky asked.

""We're over three hundred miles from home. Now I'm the one who needs a shirt."" Sam looked down at his exposed belly and then at Bucky. ""Buck, Bucky, my friend, my roommate, my partner.""

Bucky laughed and shook his head, his eyes flicking down to Sam's belly, tongue darting across his lips. ""You want me to go in, don't you?""

""I'll give you coffee money.""

Bucky reached over and patted Sam's abs again and then slid out of the car. ""Getting to pick the shirt is enough."" He was gone before Sam could stop him.

All three hundred miles home, Sam wore a skin-tight blue shirt emblazoned with a sequined shield that changed from regular to stealth colors when you ran your hand across it. Bucky couldn't seem to resist. Every few minutes, his hand strayed to Sam's chest and rubbed across his pecs.

Sam found it a little disconcerting how much he didn't mind.

 

 

It was a Wednesday morning in April when Sam found himself leaning against Bucky's door jamb, a cup of coffee in his hand. He figured Bucky must have had a bad night because it was late morning and he was still out. Sam took a sip of his coffee and watched Bucky's chest rise and fall just to make sure he actually was breathing. He had on the sequined shirt from Target, his hand resting over the star, legs sprawled atop Falcon sheets. His prosthetic arm sat in a case next to his bed.

Sam turned toward the living room before he crossed the line between checking-up and creeping-on, though some part of him wanted to keep watching. Bucky's face when he slept--it was really something.

""Sam?""

Sam looked back into Bucky's room, conjuring up a smile. ""Hey. Just making sure you weren't in trouble.""

Bucky gave him his own smile in return, his eyes still half-shut with sleep. Dammit, it was cute. Especially with his curls sticking up in eight different directions. ""Sweet that you care about me like that.""

A million snarky replies and wisecracks sat on the edge of Sam's tongue. A million other serious replies sat somewhere farther back. Bucky sat up and ran his fingers through his mussed hair. Sam couldn't help but imagine how it would feel to do that, pulling his eyes away until they fell on the half-turned shield. He rested his own hand on his chest.

""Sam?""

Sam cleared his throat.

""Sorry, was just imagining the peace and quiet I'd have without you."" Sam looked down into his coffee cup and cringed.

""Right.""

""Bucky, I--"" Sam shook his head.

""It's okay. I know where we stand.""

""We stand as friends. At the end of the day, no matter how big of a pain in my ass you are, you're my friend.""

Bucky smiled at him, a little sweet, a little bitter. ""Friends. Sure."" His hand went absently across the sequins--red, silver, blue. Then again--navy, pewter, navy.

""You stole my shirt,"" Sam said. It was a half-lie. When they'd gotten home from the centaur battle, Sam had pulled the shirt off and left it in the bathroom hamper they barely ever used. He hadn't touched it since.

Bucky looked down. One of his lips twitched. ""Oh, you want it back?"" His fingers gripped the hem and tugged it up over his head. He tossed it at Sam and sat on the edge of his bed, bare from the waist up. Sam did not follow the trail of dark hair that led into his pajamas. He did not.

He so very did.

Okay. Two could play at this game. Quietly, Sam walked toward Bucky's nightstand, putting down his coffee.

""Thanks,"" Sam said, and then he grabbed the bottom of his own shirt and pulled it off, intent on replacing it with the shield tee. He didn't get that far. Somewhere, his eyes lost in a haze of cotton, he felt cool fingertips press against his belly and trail down. Sam's breath hitched.

That same hand found Sam's wrist and pulled it away, leaving his shirt around his eyes, grabbing hold of the fabric and pulling it taut like a blindfold, deftly folding and rearranging until Sam felt the cooler air of the room hit his lips.

""Sam,"" Bucky said, like a desperate plea, and Sam felt his breath on his chin. He shuddered, remembering that he had hands, reaching out and finding Bucky's waist, fitting the circle of his palms and fingers on either side above his hip bones. He was so warm, his skin so soft. Sam wanted to touch every inch, taste every inch, feel every inch beneath him.

""Tell me not to, Sam, and I won't.""

Sam let out a plea of his own. ""Buck.""

The kiss was a surprise only so far as Sam couldn't see exactly when it was coming. He could guess by the warmth radiating off of Bucky's skin, by the way his breathing got closer and more shallow. But he still gasped into Bucky's mouth when their lips met, that gasp immediately turning into a pleased hum. Just in case Bucky thought of pulling away, Sam snaked his arms around him and held him close, humming again when Bucky's body pressed against his and Sam could feel how hard Bucky was already.

They kept kissing, Sam's eyes still wrapped in cotton, his memory of Bucky's bedroom his only guide at turning Bucky and backing him up until they both tumbled onto his bed, Sam half-falling on top of him, Bucky helping him along by never letting go of the shirt.

Rutting. Sam was rutting against Bucky like he was sixteen again, grinding away with his first girlfriend in the back of a car that was at least three different colors. Bucky met him, body rolling, hips seeking every rub of friction they could find.

""Bucky."" Sam finally broke the kiss, mouthing Bucky's jaw with wet kisses.

""You said no one gets to fuck me on these sheets but you.""

""Oh for fuck's sake.""

""We can move if you want. Just... Christ, Sam, please.""

The sound of Bucky begging went straight to Sam's cock. Fuck, he could get used to that. To Bucky needing it like that. To Bucky wanting it like that from him.

""Already told you. A guy gets as far as your bed, he's not leaving over the sheets."" Sam sucked briefly on the spot behind Bucky's ear, still rutting all the while, eating up Bucky's moans where they snaked through his veins like fire. ""You want me to fuck you then? That's what you're asking?""

""As deep as you can possibly fit,"" Bucky said, and the growl Sam let out in response was positively feral. He found Bucky's mouth again, kissing him like a thirsty man drinks from a well. And fuck if Bucky Barnes wasn't a great kisser, his tongue moving in ways that made Sam's cock ache to feel it there.

""Let me see you,"" Sam said, and Bucky finally pulled the shirt away, slowly uncovering Sam's eyes. Beneath him, Bucky's pupils had nearly eaten up the blue-gray of his eyes. His hair was somehow even messier than it had been. There was a slight blush across his chest and cheeks. ""I'll admit you're pretty damn good-looking.""

""Yeah?"" One corner of Bucky's mouth quirked up. ""Then I'll admit you're one of the hottest fellas I've ever met.""

""Love it when you talk old-timey to me, Buck.""

""Yeah? Wreck my ass and see how much I forget when and where I am.""

""How are you even mouthier when you're horny?""

""How are we still dressed?""

""That,"" Sam said, ""is actually a very good question."" And he rolled off of Bucky and stood up, raising one finger to beckon Bucky to his feet. ""Pants off, Barnes.""

""Sure thing, Captain Wilson."" Bucky slid his hand back and forth along the waistband of his pajamas until he got them past his hips, gravity doing the rest of the work. Sam stared for several seconds, drinking in Bucky's toned body, the trail of hair that led to a nest of dark curls. His cock was average, a little thick, pre-come beading at the tip.

His thighs were well above average. But Sam already knew that. If he was being honest with himself, he'd already imagined them around his waist. Had already dreamed about them there on the nights when his brain gave him good thoughts instead of bad memories.

""Turn around,"" Sam said, and Bucky grinned and happily spun on his heels.

""You want me to bend over, show you where I want you?""

""Jesus, you are nasty.""

""So yes?""

""Hell yes.""

Bucky laughed quietly and put his palm on the edge of the nightstand, arching his back and leaning forward with the grace of a dancer. That in itself was hot as fuck, but it didn't show Sam everything he wanted to see.

""I'm gonna touch you,"" Sam said, waiting for Bucky to nod before he reached out and put his hands on Bucky's ass, pulling it apart. At the first sight of that puckered rim of muscle, Sam licked his lips and groaned.

""Just think. You're gonna be in there soon.""

""Not soon enough."" Sam ran his thumb across Bucky's rim, delighting in the way Bucky shivered. ""Lube?""

Without standing up, Bucky pulled open the nightstand drawer and reached inside. Sam raised an eyebrow at the rest of the contents--a couple of vibrating toys and a dildo that was both impressive and tantalizing in size and shape.

""You play with that a lot?"" Sam asked.

""Not as often as I like. I have a roommate, you see.""

Sam leaned over his back and kissed the nape of his neck. ""Your roommate wants to watch next time.""

""Maybe he can help me get it in there.""

""Maybe he can. Help you get it in and then fuck your wrecked-out hole, huh?""

""Now who's nasty?"" Bucky asked, but he sounded half-giddy at the prospect.

""Come here."" Gently, Sam encouraged Bucky onto the bed, on his back with his thighs slightly spread. ""Give me your hand."" Bucky held it out, palm up, and Sam coated his fingers thoroughly in lube, taking a step back so Bucky and the bed were in full view.

Bucky looked at his slicked-up fingers and then at Sam with mock confusion. ""And what would you like me to do with these, Captain?""

""So that's how it is, huh?"" Sam asked, running his hand once down his length for the relief of it. Bucky's eyes bored into his, waiting, challenging. Sam raised his chin. ""Put your fingers in your ass, Bucky.""

Bucky's lips split wide, eyes blazing. On the bed, he drew his heels up onto the mattress, pushing his ass up off the bed until he could snake his hand under one thigh, reaching around to smear lube on his hole, the pink flesh there glistening with it.

""That's it,"" Sam said.

And whether he did it consciously or not, Bucky bit his lip when he started to push his finger in, a delicate little moan sliding out around his teeth.

""How fast can you do that?"" Sam asked, watching one slick finger move in and out of Bucky, his cock twitching and leaking with the need to replace it, to thrust in and out and writhe against Bucky's hot skin.

""Pretty fast. You'd think being as old as I am, I'd have learned patience by now."" Bucky slipped in another finger with a quiet cry. ""But I'm so bad at making myself wait for it."" Another grunt and Bucky added a third. ""You wanted to watch me fuck myself, right? That's what this is about?""

""Yeah, I really did."" Sam kept his eyes on Bucky's hand, on all three digits pushing into him again and again. It was hot as hell. He could already imagine the amount of times he was going to jerk off to just that image alone.

""Sam,"" Bucky said, and Sam met his eyes. ""I won't tell anybody if you can't wait for it either.""

It was like Bucky had cast a line out and hooked him right in his belly button, Sam's feet moving seemingly of their own accord, stepping closer and closer. Somewhere along the way, he popped the top on the lube, slicking down the length of his cock.

""Take your fingers out,"" Sam said, hands already pushing up on Bucky's thighs, knees walking across the mattress and those supersoft Falcon sheets they were about to thoroughly violate. Sorry, cartoon Sam.

Bucky pulled his hand free, fingers streaking wet across the back of Sam's neck when he pulled him into a hot kiss. Sam still had his mouth on Bucky's when he lined up and started to slowly push his cock inside.

""Oh fuck."" He mumbled the words against Bucky's lips, felt Bucky gasping when he took another inch. ""You okay?"" Sam choked.

Bucky hummed, his eyes shut, his chin dipping into several nods.

Little by little, Sam kept pushing, slowly losing himself in the tight heat of Bucky's body until it finally gave and let him sink the rest of the way, hips falling flush against Bucky's ass.

""Oh, God."" Sam let his forehead fall against Bucky's, the air between them growing hot and humid. ""You got any idea how tight you are?""

""Mouth,"" Bucky said, and Sam did his best to interpret that, finding Bucky's lips, sliding his tongue alongside Bucky's for several long, languid moments. Until, beneath him, Bucky started to squirm. A little wiggle here and there at first. A tiny noise of wanting. Sam pulled away, rubbing his nose alongside Bucky's.

""Buck, something you wanna ask for? Beg for maybe?""

""Maybe.""

""Go ahead then. I'll wait.""

""Sam..."" Bucky wiggled again, fingers pressing into the nape of Sam's neck, face nuzzling against Sam's, lips occasionally landing on a patch of skin, teeth sometimes following with grazes that zinged down Sam's spine.

""Bucky.""

""You gotta fuck me, pal. I'm dying.""

""Oh, are you?""

""Please.""

""That's better. Beg a little more. I like your voice like that.""

""I'll take it real good for you, Sam. All you gotta do is give it."" Bucky pulled him in for another kiss, so sloppy and wet that Sam had to force his hips to stay still. ""Please, Sammy, I want my skin to remember you for days. I wanna lay here and feel your come leaking right out of my asshole.""

""Jesus."" Sam's hips did a little dance that he could've sworn he didn't ask them to, stuttering back and forth, his cock sliding in and out of Bucky's tight rim. Beneath him, Bucky groaned so sinfully that Sam had to do it again on purpose. And fuck, that felt so good, so so good--Bucky's tight ass moving around him.

""Fuck, that's it,"" Bucky sighed, and Sam was lost. Entirely gone on Bucky and on how it felt to fuck him. He drew his hips back and thrust deep, finding a rhythm that Bucky marked with sounds that were so damn good they felt like an intergalactic crime. Surely someone was going to show up any second and tell them they had to stop, that this wasn't allowed, that things weren't allowed to be this good or to feel like this. Sam kept fucking, losing his cock in Bucky and pulling it out, only to lose it again.

Beneath him, a thin sheen of sweat coated Bucky's forehead, his cheeks even pinker, his lips too-red from snapping his teeth around them and from kissing Sam. Sam had always been aware that Bucky was attractive, but this...

Sam loosed one hand from Bucky's hips to push his sweat-damp hair back from his face. ""I really, really like you like this.""

""Good."" Bucky's hand slipped off the back of his neck and cupped one of Sam's cheeks. ""I like you like this too."" He smiled briefly--warm and soft--before his head fell back against the mattress again, opening his throat up so he could let out a deep moan that went straight to Sam's belly.

Soon. He could feel it in the way Bucky's warmth hugged him, in the way every thrust seemed to pile onto the one before it. Like he was building a wall of dominoes and at any moment, Bucky's perfectly tight hole was going to knock it the fuck over.

""Buck. Bucky."" Sam reached for his chin and took it in his hand, holding it firmly until Bucky opened his eyes and looked at him. He didn't even say it, that he was right there, that he was so so... Beneath him, Bucky grinned like he was the most blissed-out any man has ever been--half-delirious and cock-drunk.

""Come,"" Bucky slurred, hand snaking between their bodies to grip his own cock, jerking it hard and fast. Sam covered his hand, quickening his thrusts to match Bucky's near-furious pace. Beneath him, Bucky's mouth gaped open, letting out a moan that was near-continuous.

""Fuck."" Sam's jaw clenched and he swallowed hard before letting out a rumbling groan. ""Oh, fuck.""

The first domino fell, and Sam thrust deep into Bucky's hole, his hips stuttering with every twitch of his cock, come filling Bucky up while Sam moaned, trying his best to keep his eyes locked on Bucky's, to watch the faces he made when he realized Sam was doing exactly what he'd wanted.

To watch his face when...

Bucky's mouth fell open again, his eyes rolling a little when Sam felt the first drop of wet on his skin, Bucky shooting off between them, marking them both up and making an absolute mess of both their chests and bellies. Sam didn't pull out until he stopped, collapsing on the bed next to Bucky.

But Bucky, apparently, wasn't done, sliding down the bed to lick softly at the come on Sam's belly, trailing sloppy kisses down to Sam's cock where he gave his now-spent erection a couple of soft sucks like he had to make sure there was nothing left.

""Fuck,"" Sam grunted, tangling his fingers in Bucky's curls--now at their peak from the humidity of Bucky's sweat. He relaxed when Bucky kissed over one of his hip bones. ""You gonna come back up here?""

""Yeah."" Bucky slid up the mattress and pressed his body against Sam's, finding his mouth and kissing him. All the urgency gone, it was a soft kiss, almost loving. Sam had no idea how long he laid there with Bucky's mouth on his. All he knew was when he pulled away, they'd thoroughly tangled themselves together, Bucky's leg swung over his own.

""Hey,"" Sam said, running his fingers through Bucky's hair again, enjoying the feeling of Bucky's palm pressed against his bare chest. ""How you doing?""

""Good. Really good.""

""How's your ass?""

Bucky snorted softly. ""Wet. You wanna feel it?""

Sam blinked in surprise that only grew when Bucky took his hand and guided it behind his back. Sam hummed appreciatively when his fingers found Bucky's hole, loose and slick with come that Sam gently pushed back inside.

""You..."" Sam shook his head. ""Have you always talked like this?""

Bucky grinned, looking pretty damned pleased with himself.  ""You think I got bent over the seats of Army Jeeps by asking nice? Split wide open after hours at work by being coy?"" Bucky asked. ""Please, mister, since we're both working late tonight, would you like to test the structural integrity of my desk?""

""So accounting was nice then?""

""It was the Brooklyn Navy Yard. I like math and sucking dick until I choke on come. You tell me.""

""Jesus. Don't hold back now.""

""I'm gonna suck yours, you know. With permission obviously.""

""Obviously."" Sam twirled a stray curl around his index finger. ""I'm gonna eat your ass until it drips.""

Bucky playfully tweaked one of his nipples. ""Wow, Sam. Have you always talked like--""

""Stop."" Sam laughed and trailed his fingers down Bucky's side. ""You wanna take a shower?""

""With you? Think that's all I've wanted for a long time.""

Sam got up first, leading Bucky through the house like he didn't also live there. Under the spray, he washed Bucky carefully then let Bucky return the favor. And, well, if he got hard again and let Bucky suck him off while the water dripped all down his pretty face, Sam had zero regrets about that.

 

 

""Buck, I have a plan.""

""Is this a centaur plan or a jump out of--""

""For the love of fuck.""

""Fine, what's your plan?""

""Okay, so we both get a cart. You go for the snacks. I'll go for the drinks. We're in and out in under fifteen and we've got the rest of the day to--good morning."" Sam nodded at the Target employee walking past them to the front doors, giving them both a look while they pulled them open and then forced them shut behind them.

""Are you gonna get the sparkling water I like?"" Bucky asked.

""Yes, I will get your gross grapefruit sparkling water and a 4-pack of Starbucks bottles. Mocha.""

Bucky seemed to mull that over. He looked at Sam and held out his hand.

""And I'll get kettle chips and that spicy hummus you like.""

Sam shook Bucky's hand just in time for a manager to unlock the doors. Sam looked down at his watch.

""Self-checkout at 08:15.""

""You got it, Cap."" Bucky cocked a smile and saluted, and then he was off with Sam right on his heels until they reached the grocery section and split up.

Back at home, they spread their snack haul out on the coffee table, taking opposite ends of the couch, their legs tangled together in the center.

""So this is about being dead, right?"" Bucky asked while Sam scrolled through the Roku menu.

""Okay, so when you phrase it like that, it sounds really really bleak.""

""But it's a sitcom?""

""Yes. With a little romance on the side.""

""But they're dead?"" Bucky asked, and Sam looked up at him. Bucky had a plateful of chips and dips and was busy trailing a hot Cheeto through spicy nacho cheese, his brow furrowed while he made lines of red dust in the near-nuclear yellow.

""Do we need to watch something else?"" Sam nudged Bucky's thigh with his foot, and Bucky looked up at him.

""No."" He shook his head. ""Just thinking about what it would mean to find love when you thought your life was long over."" Bucky popped the chip in his mouth and chewed absently, giving Sam a small smile that made Sam's stomach twirl like a county fair Gravitron.

""Something you need to tell me?"" Sam asked, and Bucky smiled just a little wider, looking at Sam with sparkling blue-gray eyes.

""Not yet,"" he said. ""But maybe someday soon.""

""I'm looking forward to it,"" Sam said. ""And to maybe having something to say back.""

""Yeah."" Bucky reached over and squeezed Sam's ankle, the metal cool against his skin. ""Me too.""
